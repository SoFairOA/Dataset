<p>The study is focused on multifunctional performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) reinforced PEEK composites enabled via fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing (AM) utilizing in-house nanoengineered filaments. Thermo-physical, mechanical and wear characteristics of electroconductive PEEK nanocomposites are reported. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is found to decrease by 26% and 18% with the incorporation of 5 wt% GNP and 3 wt% CNT into PEEK polymer, respectively. The decrease in CTE provides better dimensional stability to resulting nanocomposite structures. Due to uniform dispersion of CNT and GNP in the PEEK matrix, the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity are both increased. The 3D printed PEEK nanocomposites reveal interfacial voids between the beads and intra-bead pores and thus exhibit lower density compared to that of the 3D printed neat PEEK. Young's and storage moduli are found to increase by 20% and 66% for 3 wt% CNT loading and by 23% and 72% for 5 wt% GNP loading respectively. However, the PEEK nanocomposites exhibit similar tensile strength to that of neat PEEK. The coefficient of friction obtained from fretting wear tests is found to decrease by 67% and 56% for 1 wt% CNT and 3 wt% GNP loaded PEEK nanocomposites, respectively and the decrease is attributed to reduced hardness and increased porosity. Multifunctional performance of carbon nanostructures reinforced AM-enabled PEEK composites demonstrated here makes them suitable for a range of applications such as orthopedics, oil and gas, automotive, electronics and space.</p>
<p>Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fabrication of complex geometries through layer-by-layer formation and is rapidly advancing towards new materials and applications [1,2]. AM offers user friendly and low-cost fabrication route that provides greater flexibility to locally design the material architecture in three-dimensions [3][4][5][6]. Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most popular AM technique for thermoplastics due to its relative simplicity and low-cost. In FFF process, the filament feedstock is fed into a heated nozzle where the polymer is fused and subsequently deposited on to a heated plate to form a 3D part, following a predefined 3D slicing pattern.</p>
<p>Despite abundant availability of FFF machines, only a few are suitable for 3D printing high performance polymers, such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), etc., as they process at high temperature. These polymers exhibit superior mechanical properties as well as high thermal and chemical resistance [7]. Among the high performance polymers, PEEK, a semi-crystalline polymer is suitable for many engineering applications, such as biomedical implants, due to its biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, radiopacity, excellent fatigue and wear resistance [8]. PEEK is also utilized for space applications as PEEK has low outgassing property and lightweight relative to metals [9]. PEEK and PEEK composites are also used in oil and gas industries for gaskets and seals. These components interact with potentially harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures and high pressures, corrosive fluids and gases, lubricating oils and solvents [10]. The drawbacks of PEEK are higher cost (compared to other commodity thermoplastics), high processing temperature (above 350 � C) and the processing difficulties associated with its semi-crystallinity. FFF technique has been successfully utilized to fabricate PEEK [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. The expensive selective laser sintering (SLS) AM technique has also been utilized to fabricate PEEK [18].</p>
<p>Precursor materials (e.g., filament, mixed photo-resin) containing micro and/or nano-fillers, such as carbon fiber [19,20], carbon black [21], GNP [22,23], CNT [24], montmorillonite [25], stainless steel, bronze and copper powders [26,27], glass microspheres and nanoclay [28], and wood flour [27] are increasingly being developed to realize AM-enabled composites. The main idea is to harness the synergistic effects of their constituents and their tailorable microstructure to realize lightweight composites with superior mechanical, electrical, thermal and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) properties. Strong parts with low CTE are desirable to ensure dimensional stability. However, typical polymers possess high CTE. It was found that the PEEK CTE can be reduced by the incorporation of low CTE and high thermal conductivity Al 2 O 3 particles [29]. Additionally, polymers reinforced with electrically conductive nanofibers, such as GNP and/or CNT have also been explored for their functional performance, such as for temperature, strain and damage-sensing [30][31][32][33][34]. Stepashkin et al. [19]. reported that Carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK composites fabricated by FFF process exhibit 25-30% lower thermal conductivity than cast CF/PEEK composites. Anisotropy of thermal properties was observed, as the short carbon fibers get oriented along the FFF deposition path. Berretta et al. [35]. fabricated PEEK nanocomposites reinforced with 1 wt% and 5 wt% CNT by FFF process and found that the incorporation of CNT into the PEEK matrix, does not influence the mechanical performance of the PEEK nanocomposites. Gonçalves et al. [36]. fabricated PEEK nanocomposite filaments reinforced with CNT/GNP. The resulting nanocomposite filaments exhibit electrical conductivity between 1.5 and 13.1 S/m.</p>
<p>The reinforcement of PEEK with CNT and GNP also influences the tribological characteristics of resulting PEEK composites. For example, addition of GNP into PEEK was found to reduce the coefficient of friction by 38% of the nanocomposite due to the lubrication action of GNP [37]. In another study, incorporation of CNT into PEEK matrix was found to result in a ~24% reduction in the friction compared to the neat PEEK [38]. The microscale wear (known as fretting wear) test is usually performed to assess the tribological performance of PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites used especially for artificial joints in orthopedics and mechanical bearings [38]. Artificial joints, experience microscale oscillatory movements between the mating surfaces [39][40][41]. Fretting wear analysis can predict the possibility of loosening of the implant due to wear at the joints [42].</p>
<p>Either most of the aforementioned studies focused on conventional fabrication of PEEK nanocomposites or 3D printed composites utilizing filaments produced by third party. In this study, we developed carbon nanostructures (CNT and GNP) engineered PEEK filaments and fabricated electro-conductive PEEK nanocomposites enabled via FFF AM. We investigated the effect of GNP (3 and 5 wt%) and CNT (1 and 3 wt%) on multifunctional properties of PEEK filaments and their corresponding FFF-PEEK nanocomposites. The melting temperature, degree of crystallinity, and density of the filament feedstocks are analyzed. The density, CTE, tensile properties, dynamic mechanical properties, and surface morphology of the PEEK nanocomposites are then investigated. The Fretting wear performance of PEEK, CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK composites is assessed against stainless steel counter body. The multifunctional performance of 3D printed GNP/PEEK and CNT/PEEK electro-conductive composites demonstrated in this study signify their potential for several structural and functional applications.</p>
<p>The KetaSpire® KT-880 high flow, injection molding grade PEEK (Solvay Specialty Polymers, www.solvay.com) was used as the matrix. This is a medical grade PEEK supplied in a lubricated pellet form, with 0.01% calcium stearate lubricant to aid the pellet flow through plasticisation screws. Two carbon nanostructures were used as nanoreinforcements: Graphistrength™ C100 multiwall CNT (Arkema, Lacq, France; www.graphistrength.com) and Grafmax HC 11 GNP (Nacional de Grafite, San Paulo, Brazil; www.grafite.com). Graphistrength® C100 MWCNT is a black powder with an apparent density of 50-150 kg/m 3 , mean agglomerate size of 200-500 μm, C content greater than 90 wt%, mean number of walls of 5-15, an outer mean diameter of 10-15 nm, and length about 0.1-10 μm [43]. Grafmax® HC 11 GNP is a black powder with a C content great than 99.5 wt%. It has a D 32 ¼ 6.99 μm, and a platelet thickness from about 0.34 to 100 nm [43].</p>
<p>To manufacture filament of an appropriate size for use in FFF machines, a filament extrusion system consisting of a twin-screw extruder, water bath, a customized filament puller, and a winding device was setup as shown in Fig. S1. To achieve precise speed control, the filament puller consists of a potentiometer, an Arduino controller, and a stepper motor. For extrusion, a Thermo Scientific Process 11 parallel co-rotating twin-screw extruder was used to melt compound the CNT/PEEK (1 and 3 wt%) and GNP/PEEK (3 and 5 wt%). To ensure a homogenous dispersion, formulations with varying concentrations were stir mixed prior to melt compounding. It is interesting to note that the GNP/PEEK compound with 3-5 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK compound with 1 wt% CNT showed good melt processability, whereas CNT/PEEK compound with 3 wt% CNT was very viscous. Viscous compound, due to its unstable melt flow, makes the filament diameter non-uniform. This in turn influences the printability of filaments and the properties of printed parts. The weight fraction of carbon nanostructures is chosen such that they form electrically percolating network in the resulting nanocomposite (electrical conductivity σ ¼ 9.1 � 10 7 S/cm for 1 wt% CNT) but still small enough for the nanocomposite to remain biocompatible.</p>
<p>Indmatec (Apium) HPP 155 3D printer was used to fabricate the specimens. Neat and nanoengineered PEEK filaments with an average diameter of 1.75 mm were used as feedstock. The deposition path and FFF parameters were defined using
<rs xml:id="12967756" type="software">Simplify3D</rs> (a 3D printing slicer software). Nozzle movement speed of 1000 mm/min, nozzle temperature of 390 � C, bed temperature of 100 � C, layer height of 0.1 mm, extrusion width of 0.48 mm, and infill density of 100% were selected as the FFF process parameters. The specimens were fabricated in two different print orientations, namely, horizontal and vertical, as described in Fig. 1. One specimen of horizontal print orientation, and four specimens of vertical print orientation were produced per fabrication cycle. Different number of specimens were selected to ensure a successful fabrication, as discussed in our recent work [17].
</p>
<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Netzsch) were performed under nitrogen atmosphere to study the melting and crystallization behavior of neat PEEK and in-house nanoengineered PEEK filaments. The samples were heated from 30 � C to 430 � C at a heating rate of 10 � C/min and then maintained isothermally at 430 � C for 5 min before cooling the samples to 30 � C at the same rate of 10 � C/ min. Subsequently after soaking isothermally for 5 min at 30 � C, the samples underwent a 2nd heating cycle. The melting temperature and heat of fusion data were obtained from the 2nd heating cycle to eliminate the influence of any thermal history and for a better surface contact between the solid sample and the DSC crucible. The degree of crystallinity X c of the samples was calculated using X c ¼ ΔH c � 100= ðΔH 0 c wÞ, where ΔH c is the heat of crystallization and ΔH 0 c is the heat of crystallization of 100% crystalline PEEK (130 J/g [44]), and w is the mass fraction of PEEK in the nanocomposites.</p>
<p>Density of the filament feedstocks and the FFF-samples were determined using a gas (Helium) displacement pycnometry system -AccuPyc II 1340, Micromeritics. Density of FFF-samples made for CTE measurements was measured. Ten repeated measurements were obtained for each sample type. The CTE of the samples was determined using Dilatometer DIL 802 from Bahr Thermoanalyse. The temperature was varied from 30 to 200 � C with a scan rate of 5 � C/min. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 5 mm and length of 50 mm were analyzed (see Fig. S3). The CTE was estimated from the relationship: ΔL=L 0 ¼ CTE* ΔT, where ΔL=L 0 is the average thermal strain along the length of the sample and ΔT is the change in temperature. Prior to testing, samples were annealed at 200 � C for 3 h to remove thermal history.</p>
<p>Room temperature tensile tests were performed on a (2.5 kN load cell) Zwick-Roell Z005 machine, following ISO 527 standard with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to obtain the distribution of axial and lateral engineering strains over the gauge length zone of the specimen. We tested only horizontally fabricated samples, with three repeats for statistical purpose. Vertically fabricated samples were not considered as this configuration leads to poor mechanical performance [17]. Prior to testing, samples were annealed at 200 � C for 3 h to remove thermal history. Fractured surfaces of the tensile specimens were examined using Nova NanoSEM to investigate the morphology of the samples and the dispersion quality of CNT and GNP in the PEEK matrix. The samples were mounted on a metal stub and gold sputtered to reduce the charging effects.</p>
<p>Glass transition temperatures (T g ), storage modulus, and tan δ of the PEEK nanocomposites were measured using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA NETZSCH-404 F1 Pegasus®). A bending mode testing was applied during the DMA scans, and the scanning range was from 30 to 250 � C at a heating rate of 3 � C/min and at a frequency of 1 Hz under nitrogen atmosphere. Each sample was tested at least twice to ensure repeatability.</p>
<p>Bulk hardness of the processed samples was analyzed using Vickers's hardness tester (BAREISS-VTEST; Bareiss Prüfger€ atebau, Germany) by applying 200-g load (n ¼ 3) with a dwell time of 10 s. The diagonals of the Vickers indents were then measured using an optical microscope to find out the hardness number. To investigate wear performance of the samples, the Fretting wear tests were performed using a ball on a flat configuration (Reciprocating Friction and Wear Monitor TR 281 M Fig. 1. Additive manufacturing of PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites by FFF. The CTE specimens were fabricated either a) horizontally with 0 � raster angle or b) vertically with 90 � raster angle. Insert (a,b) shows the magnified view of the deposition path or raster angle. Configuration of the specimen for DMA characterization is similar to that of CTE specimen. c) Horizontally fabricated dogbone specimens were used for tensile testing (also see Fig. S2). Complex 3D printed scaffold geometries of d) neat PEEK and e) CNT/PEEK. fretting wear testing machine; Bangalore, India). AISI E52100 stainless steel ball with a diameter of 6 mm was used as counter body against fretting of PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites. All the samples were tested at a frequency of 5 Hz and an applied load of 10 N with an amplitude of 100 μm for 10,000 cycles. The wear scar was observed using an optical profilometer (Bruker, contour G T, GTKOX-14-150) to quantify wear volume and wear rate. The wear rate, W (mm 3 /Nm) was then calculated using the relationship: W ¼ V PλS , where, V is the wear volume in mm 3 , P is the load in N, λ is the amplitude of displacement in m and S is the number of cycles.</p>
<p>DSC was performed on filament feedstocks (see, Fig. 2). The melting temperature (T m ), crystallization temperature (T c ), heat of fusion ðΔH m Þ, heat of crystallization ðΔH c Þ; and degree of crystallinity ðX c Þ of neat PEEK and the PEEK nanocomposite filaments were analyzed (see, Table 1). The CNT and GNP reinforced PEEK exhibit a shift in melting and crystallization peaks to a higher temperature compared to the unreinforced PEEK. The T m is increased by 1 � C and 2 � C with the addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. The T c shows higher temperature shift than T m as the T c increases by 3-4 � C and 5-6 � C with addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. It indicates that the presence of CNT and GNP in PEEK facilitates PEEK crystallization. This is further confirmed by the increase in degree of crystallinity of GNP/PEEK with 3 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 1 wt% CNT. The nano-reinforcements serve as nucleating agents permitting molecular chains of PEEK to pack into a closer arrangement [45,46]. Higher loading of nano-reinforcements (GNP/PEEK with 5 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 3 wt% CNT) exhibit negligible increase in degree of crystallinity. This could be due to the agglomeration of CNT and GNP. Agglomeration reduces the effective contact surface area between the nano-reinforcements and the matrix.</p>
<p>Fracture surfaces of tensile specimens were examined to investigate the morphology and dispersion state of the GNP and CNT in PEEK matrix. Figs. 3 and4 show the SEM images of base PEEK, GNP/PEEK, and CNT/PEEK samples at low (contain several beads) and high magnification, respectively. Fig. 3a shows smooth, brittle-like fracture surface of the base PEEK samples. The interfaces between beads of the base PEEK are not well identifiable, signifying a relatively good adhesion between beads. CNT/PEEK specimen shows surface morphology similar to that of the base PEEK, but with more visible interfaces between beads (Fig. 3c). This indicates that CNT/PEEK sample has more interfacial voids between the beads compared with base PEEK and thus lower interfacial strength. GNP/PEEK sample (see, Figs. 3b and4b) exhibits a morphology different to those of base PEEK and CNT/PEEK, indicating that the addition of GNP promotes ductility of the nanocomposite. Fig. 4 shows high magnification SEM images of the base PEEK, GNP/PEEK, and CNT/PEEK. It can be seen that CNT and GNP are uniformly dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Moreover, GNP/PEEK composite has large extent of micro and nano-pores. It is worth noting that in all samples, voids with diameters ranging from 50 to 150 μm are observed (see SI, Fig. S4). This is commonly observed in FFF process, arising due to issues, such as non-uniformity of the filament diameter and non-uniform flow of polymer melt.</p>
<p>It can be seen from Table 2 that the density of the filament feedstock slightly increases with increasing CNT and GNP content. This is due to higher density of CNT (1.6 g/cm 3 ) and GNP (2.267 g/cm 3 ) than that of the PEEK. All FFF-fabricated nanocomposites exhibit lower density than those of the filament feedstocks. The reduced density of FFF-samples is due to the formation of multiscale voids both within the beads and at the interfaces between the beads during layer-by-layer build-up of the samples. It is interesting to note that horizontally fabricated samples Fig. 2. DSC curves for the neat PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites.</p>
<p>The DSC melting and crystallization data of neat and CNT/GNP reinforced PEEK composites. exhibit lower density than that of vertically fabricated samples. This difference is attributed to the difference in thermal histories of the two configurations, as discussed in our recent work [17].</p>
<p>The polymer melt in vertically fabricated sample is deposited onto a small cross-sectional area, as seen in Fig. 1. Therefore, the deposition time in the x y plane is very short prior to moving in the z -direction. This allows a good degree of compaction of the sample, resulting in higher density, since the polymer is deposited onto a layer that is still in a molten or partially molten state. The deposition time in the x y plane of the horizontally fabricated sample is more than that of the vertically fabricated sample. Therefore, it is likely that the bead is deposited on to a solidified preceding layer, resulting in lower degree of compaction of the specimen. Significant difference in density is particularly observed for reinforced nanocomposites. For similar FFF process parameters such as the nozzle movement speed, nozzle temperature and layer height, the mass flow rate of material dispensed through the nozzle for nanoengineered filaments is lower than that for neat PEEK filament. This is due to the increased viscosity and change in flow behavior of fused nanocomposite. Therefore, the extent of interfacial voids between beads of the nanocomposites is higher than that of the base PEEK. This leads to reduced density of the nano-reinforced PEEK composites compared to base PEEK. Moreover, presence of micro and nano-pores within beads are prevalent especially in GNP/PEEK composites, contributing to reduced density of the nano-reinforced PEEK composites.</p>
<p>The thermal expansion behavior of the samples is influenced by CNT/GNP content, as well as the fabrication configuration. In this study, we measure an average CTE considering thermal expansion only along the longitudinal direction. As seen from Fig. 5, the specimen elongates as the temperature is constantly increased. Two distinct regions, separated by change in slope of strain ΔL=L 0 vs. temperature increase ΔT are observed. This corresponds to the temperature below and above T g . The CTE was estimated by evaluating the slope of ΔL=L 0 vs. ΔT, below and above T g . Table 3 summarizes CTE of neat PEEK and PEEK composites with CNT and GNP reinforcements for both horizontal and vertical fabrication configurations. One can see that for temperature below T g , the CTE of PEEK nanocomposite decreases by 16% and 26% with the addition of 3 wt% GNP and 5 wt% GNP, respectively. Incorporation of CNT into the PEEK matrix reduces the CTE as well but to a lesser extent. The addition of 1 wt% and 3 wt% CNT reduces the CTE of PEEK nanocomposites by 9% and 18%, respectively. The CTE of the nanocomposite above T g is also evaluated. It should be noted that the mechanical performance of the reinforced PEEK nanocomposites becomes poor in this temperature regime, with a storage modulus of ~10 � lower than that below T g (see, Fig. 6). The extent of decrease in CTE of the samples with GNP remains the same relative to that below T g . However, CNT incorporated PEEK specimens above T g do not exhibit significant CTE changes compared to that of base PEEK. In summary, the horizontally printed nanocomposite samples exhibit lower CTE than the base PEEK, except for CNT reinforced PEEK above T g . The in-plane CTE of GNP and CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites is lower than that of the out-of-plane direction. This is optimally manifested by the horizontally fabricated samples since GNP and CNT tend to orient along the deposition path direction. Insignificant changes in CTE of CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites above T g could be due to different intrinsic thermal expansion property of CNT above T g . The decrease in CTE with incorporation of GNP and CNT indicates better dimensional stability of the nanocomposites as compared with base PEEK.</p>
<p>The vertically fabricated samples exhibit different trend as compared to horizontally fabricated samples. GNP/PEEK samples show increase in CTE, while CNT/PEEK samples do not exhibit significant changes in CTE, both below and above T g . The CNT and GNP in vertically fabricated samples are oriented transversely to the specimen's longitudinal direction and thus intrinsically low CTE of CNT and GNP cannot be manifested by the composites. Increased CTE in vertically fabricated GNP/ PEEK samples could be due to constraints offered by carbon nanostructures for lateral expansion (as reinforcements are oriented transversely to longitudinal direction) and the resulting Poisson's effect.</p>
<p>The tensile performance of base and PEEK nanocomposites is summarized in Table 4. The stress-strain response of the samples are shown in Fig. S5. The Young's modulus of GNP and CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites increases with increase in nano-reinforcement content. However, the reinforced nanocomposites exhibit similar tensile strength to that of the base PEEK. The GNP/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit ductile fracture behavior while CNT/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit brittle fracture behavior, as discussed earlier in SEM morphology section. This is reflected in the strain at break and tensile toughness properties of the nanocomposites. Compared to base PEEK, the GNP/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit higher strain at break and toughness properties, while the CNT/PEEK nanocomposites show decreased performance. The Poisson's ratio of the base PEEK and CNT/PEEK nanocomposite samples are similar. However, GNP/PEEK nanocomposite exhibits lower Poisson's ratio. This could be attributed to the greater extent of micro-voids in GNP/PEEK samples, as indicated by SEM image presented in Fig. 4b. It should be noted that the mechanical properties of FFF-parts are influenced by factors such as the bead-bead interfacial strength, nanostructure-PEEK interfacial strength, dispersion state of the nanoreinforcement, interfacial voids between beads and the voids within the beads. The dominating factors that govern the mechanical properties of nano-reinforced FFF samples are the dispersion state of the nanoreinforcement and the interfacial strength between CNT/GNP and PEEK. The macroscopic density measurement presented in Table 2 is influenced by the density of the individual constituents (fiber and matrix), the intra-bead pores, the interfacial voids between beads and the compaction degree during processing. One cannot see a linear relationship between the density (see, Table 2) and the mechanical properties of the horizontally fabricated parts because of these multiple influencing factors. 124.9 � 2.12 ( 6%)</p>
<p>DMA analysis for base and nano-reinforced PEEK composites were performed to examine the effect of nano-reinforcement and fabrication configuration on the thermomechanical properties of the PEEK nanocomposites. The storage modulus ðE'Þ and tan δ of the PEEK nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6. In horizontally fabricated samples, incorporation of GNP and CNT into the PEEK matrix increases the storage modulus in the glassy region (below T g ). The higher content of nano-reinforcement results in higher storage modulus. The storage modulus of the samples above T g reduces drastically, with no significant difference between the base and reinforced PEEK nanocomposites. In contrast, GNP and CNT reinforcements do not significantly influence the storage modulus of vertically fabricated samples in both regimes (below and above T g ). The improved storage modulus of horizontally fabricated samples is due to uniform dispersion of GNP/CNT in the PEEK matrix (see, Fig. 4b andc) which enables efficient stress transfer between the GNP/CNT and PEEK and the improved bead-bead interfacial strength. The vertically fabricated samples do not show significant improvement with GNP/CNT incorporation because the load (in bending mode) in this sample is parallel to multiple weak interfaces between beads. For all the samples, the storage modulus shows a sharp drop at a temperature of 150 � C which indicates the T g . No significant changes in T g of both horizontally and vertically fabricated samples are noticed, as seen from the storage modulus onset and peak of tan δ.</p>
<p>Fig. 7a shows the coefficient of friction (COF) as a function of number of cycles for base PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites. COF of the PEEK decreased with the reinforcement of carbon nanostructures from ~0.25 (PEEK) to 0.08 for CNT/PEEK composite at 1 wt % CNT loading and 0.1 for GNP/PEEK composite at 3 wt % GNP loading. The wear volume and wear rate were calculated by scanning the worn surface with the help of an optical profilometer and the results are presented in Table 5. The surface profiles of the scar generated due to wear are shown in Fig. 7b,c and 7d for PEEK, CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK respectively. Bulk hardness measured through Vickers's indentation test is presented in Table 5.</p>
<p>The decrease in the COF for PEEK with the addition of carbon nanostructure can be correlated with the hardness. The hardness of CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK nanocomposites decreases from ~302 (HV) to ~ 238 and ~279, respectively. The contact areas of the counter body (6 mm dia SS ball) on the samples were calculated using image of the wear scar obtained. Wear rate was minimum in neat PEEK samples (1.23 mm 3 /Nm). Carbon nanostructure reinforced PEEK samples, exhibit higher wear rate compared to neat PEEK, i.e., 2.97 and 2.72 mm 3 /Nm for CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK respectively.</p>
<p>Neat PEEK shows lower wear rate because of higher bulk hardness and higher density, whereas CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK nanocomposites showed increased wear rate but lower COF due to their lower hardness and higher multiscale porosity. The increase in surface roughness caused by the CNT/GNP in the FFF printing process and larger extent of micro and nano-pores within the beads and between beads lead to reduced hardness.</p>
<p>Carbon nanostructures reinforced PEEK filaments were developed for FFF additive manufacturing and the multifunctional performance of resulting FFF-PEEK nanocomposites were thoroughly investigated. Influence of GNP (3 and 5 wt%) and CNT (1 and 3 wt%) content on the density, CTE, tensile properties, dynamic mechanical properties, wear, friction and hardness characteristics of 3D printed PEEK nanocomposites were investigated. The crystallization temperature and the degree of crystallinity of FFF-PEEK increase with the addition of carbon nanostructures. The print direction influences the extent and distribution of pores and thus the density. For horizontally fabricated samples, the CTE of PEEK nanocomposites significantly decreases by up to 26% and 18% with the addition of 5 wt% GNP and 3 wt% CNT, respectively, indicating a better dimensional stability of the resulting nanocomposite The tensile modulus of GNP/PEEK and CNT/PEEK nanocomposites increases with increasing nano-reinforcement content. The GNP/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit ductile fracture with concomitant increase in strain at break and toughness relative to neat PEEK. CNT/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit brittle fracture with reduced toughness. Higher micro-voids in GNP/PEEK results in lower Poisson's ratio. Incorporation of GNP and CNT increases the storage modulus in the glassy region due to uniform dispersion of GNP and CNT in the PEEK matrix for horizontally fabricated samples. CNT/PEEK and GNP/PEEK nanocomposites evince higher wear rate but lower COF due to their lower hardness and higher multiscale porosity. All nanocomposite samples examined here formed electrically percolating network and exhibited a minimum electrical conductivity σ ¼ 9.1 � 10 7 S/cm (for 1 wt% CNT loading).</p>
<p>The multifunctional performance and multiscale characteristics of FFF AM GNP/PEEK and CNT/PEEK nanocomposites demonstrated in this study exhibit their promise for several load bearing and functional applications such as orthopedics, space, oil and gas and automotive.</p>
