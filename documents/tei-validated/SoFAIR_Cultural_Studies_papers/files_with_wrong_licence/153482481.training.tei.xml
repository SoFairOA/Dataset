<p>Oral pigmentations (OPs) are often neglected, although a meticulous examination of the oral cavity is important not only in the diagnosis of oral melanoma, but also for the detection of important clinical findings that may indicate the presence of a systemic disease. OPs may be classified into two major groups on the basis of their clinical appearance: focal and diffuse pigmentations, even though this distinction may not appear so limpid in some cases. The former include amalgam tattoo, melanocytic nevi, melanoacanthoma, melanosis, while the latter include physiological/racial pigmentations, smoker's melanosis, drug induced hyperpigmentations, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentations, and OPs associated with systemic diseases.</p>
<p>We will discuss the most frequent OPs and the differential diagnosis with oral mucosal melanoma (OMM), underlining the most frequent lesions that need to undergo a bioptic examination and lesions that could be proposed for a sequential follow-up.</p>

OPs may be classified into two major groups on the basis of their clinical appearance: focal and diffuse pigmentations, even though this distinction may not appear so limpid in some cases. Oral malignant melanoma (OMM) is the most worrisome and life-threatening condition and should always be considered among the possible differential diagnoses.</p>
<p>We will discuss herein the most frequent OPs and the differential diagnosis with OMM, underlining the most frequent lesions that need to undergo a bioptic examination and lesions that could be proposed for a sequential follow-up.</p>
<p>OMM is uncommon in Caucasians (&lt;1%), in comparison to the Japanese (7.5%) [1][2][3][4] , developing mainly in the 4 th -7 th decades of life, median age 60 years. 4 Its frequency is estimated to range from 0.5-0.7% of all oral malignancies, representing a rate of frequency ranging from 25-40% among mucosal melanomas in the head and neck 3,5 , slightly more prevalent in men. [3][4][5] Mucosal melanomas account for a frequency of 1.3-6.8% of total melanomas. 1,6 In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, OMM incidence has been stable over the last years. [3][4][5] The etiology of OMM remains unknown 3,5 : chronic inflammatory stimuli such as tobacco use and chronic mechanical irritation have been proposed among possible risk factors, though evidence and pathogenetic correlations are still lacking. Intrinsic genetic factors have been recently</p>

<p>There are no reports in the literature regarding the malignant potential of oral melanocytic nevi or atypical melanocytic hyperplasias. 6 However, diagnosis is often delayed and prognosis is poor. 3,6 The lack of symptoms of OMM 5 is frequently emphasized and may justify the delay in seeking medical attention from patients.</p>
<p>On a clinical basis, OMM has been described as uniformly brown or black macules/patches or nodules often showing variation of colour, with black, brown, grey, purple, and red shades or depigmentations (fig. 1, table 2). 7 The hard palate or alveolus gingiva are most often affected. 3,5,6 Satellite foci within the oral mucosae surrounding the primary tumor have also been reported. 7 Moreover, similarly to their cutaneous counterpart, amelanotic melanomas presenting no pigmentation (33-50% of cases) have been reported. 3,5 OMM may be ulcerated in up to 1/3 of cases. 5 Some authors highlighted the usefulness of the cutaneous dermoscopic criteria (table 2) to rule out OMM 7 , but limited data are available. 1 Despite the fact that dermoscopy may be considered a useful tool to support the diagnosis of OMM permitting an earlier diagnosis, the irregular oral mucosal surface and the complex anatomy represent technical limitations.</p>

<p>Olszewska et al. 1 reported that the typical dermoscopic patterns consist of irregular diffuse pigmentation and pseudo-network, together with regression structures and a blue-whitish veil. Other elements are the presence of different colours (blue, black, grey and brown), asymmetry of structures with irregular borders and sharp interruption of the reticular pattern. Atypical vessels together with irregularly distributed heterogeneous dots and globules may be observed. 1,8 To date there is no consensus on OMM clinical diagnosis, or algorithms that indicate which is the best surgical approach to suspected lesions.</p>
<p>An early and prompt diagnosis of OMM could be important for the patient's prognosis, as OMMs show a more aggressive behavior and a worse prognosis than cutaneous MM. 3 In fact, almost 1/3 of patients presents lymph node metastases at the moment of the diagnosis of a primary OMM. The early development of metastases might be due to the high level of vascularization and anatomy of lymphatic drainage in this district. 3 Therefore, together with the clinical examination, imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan) of the head and neck area are mandatory, as well as of the thoraco-abdominal district, for the correct tumoral staging. 3,5 In contrast with cutaneous melanoma, OMMs display a very low BRAF V600E mutation rate (&lt;6%), reducing the chances of therapeutic options with BRAF inhibitors, and no mutations are found in NRAS and GNAQ/GNA11. 5 Since the C-Kit mutations frequency seems to be higher (7-25%), therapy with Imatinib</p>

<p>-Amalgam tattoo Metallic compounds and in particular amalgam, have been extensively used for the treatment of cavities in endodontic procedures. Patients usually come to our attention for the evaluation of blue to grey macules of the gingiva. No symptomatology is usually reported. These lesions are generally 0.1-2 cm in diamete 10 , and are mainly located in the gingiva and alveolar mucosa, near the restored tooth. Other compounds such as graphite have been described as the cause of mucosal tattoos, mostly by accidental incisions and incorporation of the latter in the soft tissues. 11 Histology reveals amalgam particles along collagen fibers and around blood vessels. 10 Few lymphocytes and macrophages and sometimes foreign-body giant cells are detected.</p>
<p>Dermoscopy shows a grainy structureless homogenous bluish pattern (table 2). 1 If an accurate anamnesis reveals a history of previously amalgam treatment 3 , sequential clinical observations (every 3-6 months of follow-up) using global</p>

All rights reserved. oral photography (GOP) or dermoscopy, where possible for anatomic reasons, could be proposed. 6 Clinicians should pay particular attention to the location of gingival and hard palatal lesions, and a biopsy could be mandatory in case of clinical suspicion or minimal changes on follow-up, since these are the most common sites of oral nevi or/and OMM. 5</p>
<p>Melanoacanthoma may also affect the oral mucosa after chronic traumas, most frequently in black women. On clinical observation this condition appears as a single, asymptomatic pigmented macule or plaque. A rapid increase in size has been reported and buccal mucosa is the most common site. Incisional biopsy and histological examination are required to rule out OMM. 6,[12][13][14] Histology reveals dendritic melanocytes in an acanthotic epithelium with spongiosis, together with few lymphocytes and eosinophils. 11,14 An established dermoscopic pattern is lacking in the current literature. 2 Self-healing after biopsy may occur and in long-lasting lesions topical steroids may represent a therapeutic option. 10,11 Sequential clinical observations (every 3-6 months of follow-up) using GOP and dermoscopy, where possible, could be proposed in order to monitor the lesion's evolution or treatment response.</p>

<p>-Melanotic macules Melanotic macules, also known as melanosis, are benign OPs most frequently involving the lower lip and palate of women. 6 They present as single (less frequently multiple) brownish, well demarcated macules, less than 1 cm in diameter (fig. 2,table 2). On histopathology these lesions are characterized by a normal number of melanocytes that show an increased melanin production and an increased basal cell pigmentation (fig. 3). 9,10,13 Three main dermoscopic patterns may be observed: reticular-like, parallel (fig. 4a) and structureless (fig. 4b). In the lower lip a parallel pattern with narrow linear or partly curved lines is most often detected, but a mixed parallel-structureless pattern may occur. 2 More recently, other authors described metaphorically other dermoscopic features of these lesions such as ring-like pattern, fish scale-like pattern and hyphal pattern. 15 Sequential monitoring with GOP can be proposed in compliant patients if the lesions measure &lt;0.5 cm. 4 Since the main differential diagnosis is OMM, a biopsy is required to rule out OMM in the case of size &gt;0.5 cm and if different colours (such as brown/blue/grey/white) and/or irregular borders (frequently observed in these lesions) are present.</p>
<p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p>
<p>-Melanocytic nevi Melanocytic nevi on the oral mucosa (OMN) are uncommonly observed. The reported incidence is 1:10000 and they generally arise in the second-fourth decades of life. 9,10,13 The most common locations are the hard palate, buccal mucosa and vermilion of the lip. 9,13 Clinically, these lesions appear as well demarcated dark black to brown or blue macules or papules (table 2).</p>
<p>Dimensions are reported to range from 0.1 to, rarely, 3.0 cm and nevi measuring 0.5 cm are the most commonly observed. 6 On histopathology, the lesions mainly appear intramucosal (55%) and as blue nevi (36%). 3 Hematoma/hemangiomas and other vascular malformations should be ruled out on clinical inspection. Dermoscopy reveals symmetric homogeneous lesions and sometimes a regular pigmented network. A homogeneous bluish structure is observed in the case of blue nevus (table 2). 2 Sequential monitoring (short follow-up every 3 months) could be proposed in patients younger than 20 years and for lesions of smaller diameter (&lt; 0.5 mm).</p>
<p>A biopsy is required in all other cases, or when lesions present minimal changes in sequential monitoring, in order to obtain the definitive diagnosis and rule out melanoma. 6</p>
<p>-Physiological/racial pigmentations Physiological ethnic pigmentation usually occurs in non Caucasians, involving the gingiva symmetrically and sparing the mucogingival margin, due to increased melanin production (fig. 5). Clinically, diagnosis is easy and biopsy is not required. 3 Diffuse or patchy brownish pigmented areas are observed and no treatment is required (fig. 6, table 2). 16,17 In our series dermoscopy showed a parallel pattern (fig. 7a) and a homogeneous structureless pattern (fig. 7b). A transitory physiological OP may occur during pregnancy and may be associated with a concomitant skin pigmentation, also known as melasma affecting the nipple area and the genital mucosae. 16</p>
<p>Smoking-associated melanosis is a black-brown diffuse pigmentation determined by an increased melanin production in the basal layer, probably triggered by tobacco. Its occurrence and extension are both related to the number of cigarettes and the duration of smoking. Anterior gingiva, buccal mucosa but also the tongue and lip mucosa can be affected. No treatment is mandatory. 9,10,14</p>

<p>Diagnosis is usually performed on a clinical basis and biopsy is not required. However, clinical monitoring is recommended (every 12 months), together with patient's self-inspection.</p>
<p>-Drug induced hyperpigmenations OPs may be induced by a large number of drugs. A full medical history is mandatory when dealing with diffuse pigmentations and physiological causes are ruled out. 18 Drug-induced OPs may present as localized to multiple and diffuse brown-bluish-black areas. 16 Clinical monitoring, also on a regular basis (every 12 months), and patient's self-inspection every 3-4 months is recommended.</p>
<p>Post-inflammatory OPs develop after an underlying, usually long lasting inflammatory process. 14 Lichen planus and lichenoid reactions are most commonly involved. 19 Hyperpigmentation may persist after the resolution of the disease. Other possible conditions include chronic periodontal disease, pemphigus and pemphigoid. 10 A biopsy is recommended for single/isolated pigmented lesions, even if the diagnosis of an inflammatory disease is already acknowledged on anamnesis. Bowen disease with its pigmented variant, previously described in other mucosae, should be ruled out. Follow-up is</p>
<p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. recommended for these patients, since the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of OMM is yet to be determined. 3,5 Other systemic diseases Systemic diseases associated with OPs may be due to multiple conditions, some life-threatening, including genetic (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Laugier-Hunziker disease, Leopard syndrome and Carney Complex syndrome) and endocrine diseases (McCune-Albright syndrome and adrenal gland diseases). The cutaneous and extra-cutaneous symptoms, together with the pathogenetic background, are summarized in Table 1. [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] Biopsy is necessary only for single lesions, isolated or occurring on a background of a diffuse pigmentation that evolves/changes over time upon clinical inspection.</p>
<p>OMM should be differentiated from a wide-ranging spectrum of affections, both benign and malignant, determined by endogenous and exogenous disorders that lead to pigmentations of the oral mucosae. The correct diagnosis of OPs is challenging for the physician for two reasons: firstly in order to rule out melanoma and secondly because OPs may represent an isolated finding or a manifestation of more complex systemic diseases. 17 Therefore, the oral cavity should be routinely investigated during dermatological examinations. To date there are no criteria that facilitate the clinical diagnosis in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Dermoscopy could represent a useful tool in the diagnostic differentiation from vascular abnormalities 27,28 , although the compression may cause an alteration or</p>

<p>fading of diagnostic elements. The main observations could be red or pink homogeneous areas, with a slightly visible white collarette (not scaly as in the cutaneous dermoscopic observation) in pyogenic granulomas, or the typical red and dark lacunae in hemangiomas. OMM may feature vascular structures, though typically disarranged, but a careful examination of the perimeter of the mass should be made (where possible for anatomic reasons) in order to evaluate the presence of pigmented areas. In focal pigmentations (nevi, melanotic macules, melanoacantoma or amalgam tattoos), a biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard, especially for lesions with a diameter &gt; 0.5 cm. Clinical morphologic changes on sequential monitoring should also require a biopsy. In the presence of diffuse oral pigmentations (in drug-induced manifestations, inflammatory diseases) a GOP is recommended and biopsy should be reserved for lesions that evolve during monitoring or/and present clinical similarities with OMM. 3 OPs due to systemic diseases should be followed up on a clinical basis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, considering the aggressive behavior and poor prognosis of OMM, oral cavity inspection should be regularly performed by clinicians and patients should be well informed and encouraged to carry out self-inspections.</p>
