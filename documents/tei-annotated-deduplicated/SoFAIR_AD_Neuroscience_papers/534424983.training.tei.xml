<p>22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a highly penetrant and common genetic cause of neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from 15 subjects with 22q11DS and 15 controls and differentiated them into 3D cerebral cortical organoids. Transcriptional profiling across 100 days showed high reliability of differentiation and revealed changes in neuronal excitability related genes. Using electrophysiology and live imaging, we identified defects in spontaneous neuronal activity and calcium signaling in both organoid-and 2D-derived cortical neurons. The calcium deficit was related to resting membrane potential changes that led to abnormal inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Heterozygous loss of DGCR8 recapitulated the excitability and calcium phenotypes and its overexpression rescued these defects. Moreover, the 22q11DS calcium abnormality could also be restored by application of antipsychotics. Taken together, our study illustrates how stem-cell derived models can be used to uncover cellular phenotypes associated with genetic forms of neuropsychiatric disease.</p>
<p>A central challenge in studying the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is the heterogeneity of these behaviorally defined conditions 1 . One approach to overcome this complexity is to study patients with highly penetrant genetic mutations 2 . The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the most frequent (1: 3000) deletion 3 . Up to one in four 22q11.2DS patients develop psychosis, which correspond to a ~20-fold increase in risk, and accounts for 1-2% of all schizophrenia cases [4][5][6] . This microdeletion also confers a 30-40% risk for ASD 7,8 . This genetic syndrome provides an opportunity to begin addressing heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric disorders and to identify neuronal phenotypes.</p>
<p>Rodent models of 22q11DS have provided important insights 3,9,10 , including describing circuit dysfunction [11][12][13] . However, human neuronal phenotypes, especially in the context of the unique genomic structure of the human 22q11.2 locus 14 , remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Therefore, novel approaches to capture the pathobiology of this genetic deletion are required. Cellular reprogramming technologies allow the in vitro generation of human neurons 15 . These models maintain the genetic background of the individuals from which the human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells were derived. Recent studies [16][17][18] have begun to explore transcriptional changes in neural cells derived from a small 22q11DS cohort, but the functional defects in human 22q11DS neurons and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated.</p>
<p>To better understand neuronal pathways leading to disease in 22q11DS, we differentiated 43 hiPS cell lines derived from 15 patients carrying the canonical 3Mb 22q11.2 deletion and 15 controls. We derived 3D human cortical spheroids (hCS) [19][20][21] , which are regionalized brain organoids that show high reliability of differentiation 22 , as well as cortical glutamatergic cultures using 2D differentiation 23,24 . Transcriptional analyses performed over 100 days of 3D differentiation, indicated abnormal neuronal excitability. We found changes in spontaneous firing and depolarization-induced calcium defects in 22q11DS cortical neurons. This was related to abnormalities in the resting membrane potential (RMP), which led to defects in the disease-associated 25,26 voltage gate L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Moreover, the calcium and membrane potential defects were phenocopied in an isogenic hiPS cell line carrying one copy of the 22q11.2 locus gene DGCR8 and were restored by viral delivery of this gene. Lastly, these defects were rescued by a short treatment with antipsychotics, which are known to influence excitability and LTCC 27 . Taken together, these experiments identify key cellular phenotypes for 22q11DS in human neurons and have the potential for identifying therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>We used cell reprogramming to generate hiPS cells from fibroblasts taken from a cohort of 15 patients with 22q11DS (22.8 ± 2.4 years; female to male, 60% to 40%) and 15 controls (23.8 ± 4.0 years; female to male, 67% to 33%; Supplementary Tables 123and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). We used SNP arrays to verify genome integrity and to confirm the 22q11.2 deletion (Extended Data Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table 4). Next, we differentiated 43 hiPS cells lines using a directed differentiation approach to derive hCS (Fig 1a) [19][20][21] . hCS transcriptionally resemble the developing cerebral cortex, contain functional glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes, and their generation is highly reliable across differentiation experiments and lines 22 .</p>
<p>To analyze the transcriptomic changes during corticogenesis, we collected RNA at day 25, 50, 75 and 100 from 15 hiPS cell lines derived from 12 22q11DS individuals in 17 differentiation experiments and 14 hiPS cell lines from 11 controls in 26 differentiations experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2a).</p>
<p>We first established the reproducibility of differentiation 22 . We found high Spearman's correlation coefficients (mean ~ 0.97) between differentiations of the same cell line (within individuals) and between different hiPS cell lines (P&lt; 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 2b,c), for matched differentiation days. We next used principal component analysis (PCA) to interrogate the transcriptional variance between differentiations (Fig. 1b,c). The main source of variation was related to the timing of differentiation, with the first principal component (PC1) explaining 33% of the variance, similar to what we previously observed 22 . Genetic ancestry explained a small portion of the variance (Extended Data Fig. 2d). PC2 (7.4%), as well as PC5, PC6 and PC7 (8.1% combined), were related to differences between the 22q11DS and control groups. Furthermore, variance partitioning showed that differentiation time explained 28% of the variance, while the differentiation experiment and the hiPS cell line explained 9.3% and 3.9% of the variance, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2e). To investigate potential disease-related differences in differentiation, we verified the temporal trajectories of gene expression for selected cortical markers and found high consistency (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Lastly, we performed single-cell transcriptomics in four different hiPS cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Clustering of cells using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) revealed a separation of STMN2 expressing neurons, from progenitors and mitotically active cells expressing VIM and TOP2A (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We also identified a group of glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1 + ) expressing the cortical layer markers TBR1; a group of intermediate progenitors expressing EOMES; a group of dorsal progenitors expressing PAX6; a group of astroglia (CLU + ); a small group of cells that resemble the choroid plexus (TTR + , SLC13A4 + ) and a very small number of GAD1 + cells. We then compared expression of all detected genes across all 4 lines and we found that they were highly correlated (Extended Data Fig. 3d,g). Similarly, we found that gene expression in each domain was highly correlated across lines (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Finally, we compared the proportion of cells in each cluster across lines and found that cell diversity was overall similar across lines and groups (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Together, this data demonstrates high reliability of hCS and suggests that defects in early cortical differentiation may not be a significant contributor to developmental defects in 22q11DS.</p>
<p>We next examined gene expression patterns within the 22q11.2 locus by bulk RNA-seq (Fig. 1d). We found that 57 genes were expressed in the hCS, which overlapped with the 67 genes from that region shown to be expressed in human fetal brain (Extended Data Fig. 2f) 28 . The majority of protein-coding genes were downregulated in 22q11DS hCS by ~50% (Extended Fig. 2g), except for DGCR8 which was down regulated by about 20%. We then performed differential expression in hCS-derived from 29 hiPS cell lines to investigate the genomewide effects of microdeletion. A power analysis based on our first batch indicated an 85% power of detecting ~18% change in expression (Extended Data Fig. 2h). We identified 87, 34, 258 and 46 differential expressed genes (DEG, FDR&lt; 0.05) at days 25, 50, 75 and 100 respectively (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table 5). DEG were broadly expressed across cell types (Extended Fig. 3h). A DEG subset overlapped with transcriptomic changes in a 22q11DS human model 18 , but we found no overlap with a mouse model 29 (Extended Data Fig. 2i). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) we found changes in genes associated with RNA modification and gene silencing by RNA that may be related to loss of DGCR8 30 (Fig. 1f; Supplementary Table 6). We also found enrichment for genes related to mitochondrial function 31 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Moreover, we also observed an enrichment for genes related to neuronal excitability, including the regulation of calcium transport, calcium signaling or voltage gated calcium channel activity, but also with the regulation of RMP. Lastly, to test whether DEGs in 22q11DS were enriched for psychiatric disease genes, we verified enrichment SNPs heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for ASD 32 , schizophrenia 33 and ADHD 34 (Fig. 1g). We observed an enrichment for variants associated with schizophrenia, but not for DEG found in ASD or SCZ postmortem brain tissue 35,36 .</p>
<p>The changes in excitability genes prompted us to investigate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons. We performed cell-attached and wholecell patch clamp recordings in dissociated hCS neurons at 70-80 days (Extended Data Fig. 5a) that were labeled with AAV-Syn1::YFP. We found that 22q11DS cells were approximately 4x more likely to spontaneously fire action potentials than controls (P= 0.001; Fig. 2a,b; P= 0.0006; Extended Data Fig. 5b). We next tested whether the increased spontaneous firing in 22q11DS is associated with intrinsic changes in action potential (AP) firing (Fig. 2c). In neurons that fired at least one AP (93% in 22q11DS and 74% in controls), we found no differences in AP amplitude (P= 0.69), threshold (P= 0.97), rheobase (P= 0.22), maximal rate of rise (P= 0.29), maximal rate of decay (P= 0.43) between 22q11DS and control neurons (Extended Data Fig. 5c). This suggests that the ability to generate are not affected in 22q11DS cortical neurons.</p>
<p>We next investigated if the abnormal neuronal excitability in 22q11DS neurons is coupled with changes in calcium signaling during depolarization. We examined intracellular calcium ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in dissociated, Syn1 + hCS neurons using the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2 and time-lapse microscopy. In 22q11DS neurons, we observed a decrease in the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following 67 mM KCl depolarization (Fig. 2d), which was consistent across the cohort (Fig. 2e, left; P&lt; 0.0001). A mixed model ANOVA analysis indicated that variability across lines contributed only 19.9% of the variance in the phenotype (Fig. 2e, right; P&lt; 0.0001). We did not observe differences in [Ca 2+ ] i between patients with versus those without psychosis (P= 0.88), although our cohort with ascertained psychiatric diagnoses was limited. We also tested if this defect is present in 22q11DS neurons derived with a different, 2D cortical differentiation method 23,37 (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). We similarly found a decrease in the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following depolarization (Extended Data Fig. 6c; P &lt; 0.0001). A mixed model indicated that variability across lines contributed only 2.6% of the variance (Extended Data Fig. 6d, right; P&lt; 0.0003). Taken together, these experiments in 2D and 3D cortical neurons indicate that this phenotype was robust and consistent across 10 lines in 22q11DS as compared to 10 control (Cohen's d= 3.76 for hCS and 4.37 for 2D neurons).</p>
<p>We next asked whether the calcium changes were present over time during in vitro maturation. We found that although there was an ~48% increase in the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] i rise in 22q11DS neurons from day 70-80 to day 90-100, the overall defect was present even after 5.5 months of differentiation (Fig. 2f; P&lt; 0.0001; P&lt; 0.0001 for day 70-80, P&lt; 0.0001 for day 80-90, P= 0.003 for day 166).</p>
<p>In exploring the depolarization-induced calcium rise, we found that pretreatment with nimodipine, a blocker of LTCCs, decreased the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] i rise by ~64% in control cortical and by ~57% in 22q11DS (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b; P &lt; 0.0001). To test the contribution of voltage-gated sodium channels, we used the sodium channel blocker TTX. We found a decrease in the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] i rise, but the difference between 22q11DS and control was still present following TTX (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d; P = 0.03). To verify the contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3 hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, we applied the 2,3-dioxo-6 nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) and (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (APV) blockers, and found little or no effect on the [Ca 2+ ] i rise amplitude following exposure and between groups (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f; P = 0.77).</p>
<p>To verify whether the [Ca 2+ ] i defect was cell non-autonomous, for example due to a difference in neurotransmitter released during depolarization, we measured the level of catecholamines, glutamate and GABA, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We found either undetectable levels (dopamine, GABA) or no change (glutamate, norepinephrine) between groups (Extended Data Fig. 8a-d). We also co-cultured 2D-derived 22q11DS and control neurons after labeling with AAV-Syn1::YFP (Extended Data Fig. 6e). We found that co-culturing did not affect the phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 6f; P = 0.008).</p>
<p>We next sought to gain insight into the mechanism underlying the depolarization induced [Ca 2+ ] i impairment in 22q11DS. To test whether the biophysical properties or the density of calcium channels could explain this phenotype, we performed voltage clamp recordings from neurons. We first used Ba 2+ as the main charge carrier to reduce the effect of Ca 2+ dependent inactivation of the channels (Fig. 3a). In the presence of pharmacological agents that isolate calcium-channel mediated currents, we found no difference in the Ba 2+ current amplitude or charge between 22q11DS and control hCS neurons (Fig. 3b,c; P= 0.68 for amplitude; P= 0.44 for charge) or 2D-derived cortical neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7h, i; P= 0.23 for amplitude; P= 0.28 for charge). We also found no significant difference in the activation curve between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 7g; P = 0.78). Finally, using patch-clamp measurements with Ca 2+ as the charge carrier, we did not find a reduction current amplitude or charge in 22q11DS neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k; P = 0.04). Together, these findings suggest that the calcium deficit in 22q11DS neurons is not caused by a reduction in either the LTCCs number or the activation kinetics.</p>
<p>We then considered the possibility that changes in the conductance of other ions might explain the excitability and calcium phenotype in 22q11DS. We measured the RMP and found that patient-derived neurons were more depolarized (Fig. 3d; P&lt; 0.0001). Although the variability across lines and their interactions contributed 47% of the variance, the fixed effect in a mixed model was significant (Fig. 3d, right; P&lt; 0.01). Similarly, 2D cortical neurons from 22q11DS were also more depolarized (Extended Data Fig. 6g; P = 0.0005). The electrophysiological properties of our hiPS cell-derived neurons are very similar to what has been previously reported in human neurons 38 . The RMP for control hiPS cellderived neurons is approximately -52 mV. Similarly, recordings in slices of mid-gestation human fetal cerebral cortex show a RMP of -49.8 mV 38 . Interestingly, altered excitability and a tendency towards depolarized RMP, have also been observed at postnatal stages in pyramidal neurons in a 22q11.2DS rodent model 29,39 .</p>
<p>We next inquired how changes in RMP could lead to the calcium defect in 22q11DS cortical neurons. One mechanism that controls LTCCs availability is voltage-dependent inactivation, which occurs on the time scale of seconds 40 . We calculated the inactivation curve (h∞) of control and 22q11DS neurons by holding the neurons at different holding potentials (-110 to +30 mV) for 5 seconds, before applying an activating step to -20 mV (Fig. 3e). We found no difference in the shape of the inactivation curve (Fig. 3f; P = 0.35). However, the fraction of available channels at -50 mV and -40 mV, which roughly correspond to the RMP of control or 22q11DS neurons, respectively, was decreased in patients (Fig. 3f, inset).</p>
<p>To better understand the effect of voltage-dependent calcium channel inactivation, we induced a subtle depolarization in control neurons by pretreatment with 10 mM KCl prior to applying 67 mM KCl 41 . We found that the pretreatment (in 2D-and 3D-derived neurons) resulted in a decrease in the [Ca 2+ ] i amplitude in control neurons (~31%), partly mimicking the phenotype in 22q11DS (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i; hCS, P &lt; 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 6l,m; 2D, P &lt; 0.0001). Lastly, we directly tested how these changes in inactivation-dependent Ca 2+ flux affect [Ca 2+ ] i rise by imaging of patch clamped neurons. We filled single, control-derived neurons with cell impermeant Fura-2 and performed calcium imaging while whole-cell voltage clamping neurons (Fig. 3g,left). We found that the rise in the amplitude [Ca 2+ ] i following a depolarizing voltage step from -70 mV to +10 mV was approximately 2x lower when preceded by an inactivating pre-pulse to -40 mV (Fig. 3g, right; P= 0.02). Taken together, these experiments suggest that voltage-dependent inactivation of calcium channels, which is related to a more depolarized membrane potential, results in a defect in [Ca 2+ ] i in 22q11DS neurons. Moreover, defects in RMP are also likely causing a change in excitability in 22q11DS neurons.</p>
<p>One of the genes deleted in the 22q11.2 region is DGCR8a component of the microprocessor complex involved in microRNA biogenesis 30 , has been associated with neuronal defects in rodent models of disease, and therefore has an outsized potential to dysregulate downstream target genes contributing to neuronal phenotype 11,42 . To investigate if DGCR8 may be involved in the excitability and calcium phenotypes in human 22q11DS cortical neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to induce a single allele base-pair insertion and generate a heterozygous isogenic line (DGCR8 +/-) in a control background (Extended Data Fig. 9a).</p>
<p>In cell-attached patch clamp recordings, we found that DGCR8 +/-Syn1 + cells were also approximately 4x more likely to spontaneously fire APs than Syn1 + cells derived from the parental hiPS cell line (Fig. 4a, b P= 0.003). We next investigated if abnormal neuronal excitability in DGCR8 +/-neurons is coupled with changes in calcium signaling during depolarization. Using Fura-2 live imaging, we observed a decrease in the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following depolarization (Fig. 4c), which was similar to the defects in 22q11DS neurons (Fig. 4d; P&lt; 0.0001). We also measured the RMP in patch clamped cells and found that DGCR8 +/--derived neurons were more depolarized than the parental control neurons (Fig. 4e; P= 0.009). Overall, these results show that heterozygous loss of the DGCR8 gene in hiPS-cell derived neurons is sufficient to induce changes in calcium and excitability in 22q11DS cortical neurons.</p>
<p>To explore the role of DGCR8 in mediating calcium defects in cortical neurons and to assess the reversibility of these phenotypes, we first attempted rescue phenotypes in DGCR8 +/- hCS by acute gene replacement. We delivered DGCR8 using a lentiviral construct (Lenti-EF1α::DGCR8) in DGCR8 -/+ neurons at day 60-70 (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Imaging with Fura-2 at day 70-80 showed that overexpression of DGCR8 restored the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following depolarization (Fig. 5a,b; P= 0.002). Interestingly, overexpression of DGCR8 in control cells did not result in a higher amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following depolarization (Fig. 5b; P&gt; 0.99).</p>
<p>To determine if DGCR8 could rescue 22q11DS phenotypes, we overexpressed DGCR8 in hCS neurons differentiated from two 22q11DS patients (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Imaging with Fura-2, showed that overexpression increased the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i rise following depolarization, although it did not restore the amplitude to control levels (Fig. 5c,d; Extended Data Fig. 9c). To explore potential transcriptional overlap between DGCR8 +/- and 22q11DS neurons, we used RT-qPCR to test expression of 8 selected 22q11DS DEG genes that are related to ion transport (ATP1A2, CACNB4, KCNJ11, CALY) and excitability (WNT5A, PCP4, CALCB), as well as one of the top DEG genes, ZNF132. We found that ATP1A2 43 , a sodium-potassium transporter ATPase involved in maintaining the RMP, WNT5A which regulates neuronal excitability and calcium signaling 44 , as well as ZNF132, were also downregulated in DGCR8 +/-hCS (Extended Data Fig. 9d). These results indicate that acute overexpression of DGCR8 in human cortical neurons that are hemizygous for DGCR8 or the 22q11.2 locus can lead to partial rescue in calcium signaling and suggest a potential role for DGCR8 in regulating neuronal excitability.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the effect of DGCR8 overexpression on the RMP of 22q11DS and control neurons. We found that, at 10-15 days following viral delivery, DGCR8 overexpression hyperpolarized the membrane potential of 22q11DS neurons by ~7 mV, while it had little or no effect in control neurons (Fig. 5e; P= 0.01).</p>
<p>One way to ascertain disease-relevant phenotypes is to identify cellular phenomenon that can be reversed with drugs that can improve clinical symptoms. Current evidence suggests that patients with 22q11DS respond similarly to idiopathic schizophrenia patients when treated with antipsychotics 45,46 . A common feature of many antipsychotics is a modulation of dopamine D2 receptor function, which has been linked to clinical response 46,47 . This G αi coupled receptor has been shown to modulate the function of LTCC 48,49 . Previous work has reported expression of DRD2 gene, which encodes the D2 receptor, in pyramidal neurons of the cortex in vivo 49,50 . We found that the D2 receptor is expressed by at least a subset of hiPS cell-derived cortical neurons, similar to what has been reported in vivo 49,50 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Therefore, we exposed 22q11DS neurons to raclopride, a high affinity D2 receptor blocker 51 , and imaged [Ca 2+ ] i shortly before and during depolarization (Fig. 6a,b). We found that pretreatment with raclopride was sufficient to restore the deficit in [Ca 2+ ] i in 22q11DS neurons, while having no statistically significant effect on control neurons (Fig. 6a,b; P&lt; 0.003). On average, raclopride increased the [Ca 2+ ] i amplitude by ~104% in 22q11DS. Using cell-attached patch clamp recordings, we also found a reduction in the fraction of spontaneously firing 22q11DS neurons after application of raclopride (Fig. 6c; P= 0.03; P= 0.37). Additionally, raclopride pretreatment was also sufficient to restore the deficit in [Ca 2+ ] i in DGCR8 +/-neurons (Fig. 6d, e; P&lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>To verify that this effect was not restricted to raclopride, we tested another antipsychotic. We found that pretreatment with sulpiride was sufficient bring the 22q11DS [Ca 2+ ] i amplitude to control levels (Extended Data Fig 10c,d; P= 0.008).</p>
<p>Next, we wondered whether the rescue effect by raclopride or sulpiride was mediated by a change in the RMP. We used patch-clamping to monitor RMP changes of the neurons (held at -40 mV) while applying raclopride using a local puff electrode. We found that, within seconds, raclopride application resulted in hyperpolarization by approximately ~5 mV in both control and 22q11DS cells (Fig. 6f; for 22q11DS: P= 0.01, for control: P= 0.004). Similarly, we found that the application of sulpiride resulted in hyperpolarization of control and 22q11DS neurons (Extended Fig. 10e; 22q11DS: P= 0.002; control: P&lt; 0.0001). Finally, we tested a second-generation antipsychotic drug that has lower affinity for dopamine D2 receptors 52 . We found that the application of olanzapine, at a similar concentration of 10 μM, also resulted in hyperpolarization and rescue of the RMP of 22q11DS neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10f; P= 0.008). This data suggests these three antipsychotic drugs likely rescue the 22q11DS defect by restoring the RMP in cortical neurons.</p>
<p>Microdeletions at the 22q11.2 locus are the most frequent interstitial deletion in humans 53 . The clinical phenotype of 22q11DS is highly variable and involves multiple systems. While the cardiovascular and immune deficiencies can be managed successfully in 22q11DS, the associated psychiatric disorders remain unaddressed therapeutically. This is partly because the molecular defects underlying neurodevelopmental disorders in 22q11DS are not known. Previous models for this disease have provided pathophysiological clues 9,10,54 , but we are still far from developing effective therapeutics for mental illness in 22q11DS.</p>
<p>Using both cortical organoids and 2D glutamatergic neurons from a large cohort of 22q11DS patients and controls, we identified specific cellular phenotypes associated with 22q11DS. Although the defect was observed in both 2D and 3D cortical neurons, derivation of hCS allowed to scale up neural differentiation experiments, as we have previously found 22 . Importantly, we showed that neural differentiations are highly reliable and 22q11DS is not associated with major defects in corticogenesis. Starting with transcriptional profiling of cortical neurons, we first identified a signature suggestive of perturbed neural excitability. Electrophysiological and imaging experiments confirmed an increase in excitability and an impaired depolarization-induced LTCC calcium signaling in 22q11DS-derived neurons, which were related to a defect in the RMP that caused voltage-dependent inactivation of calcium channels. Although we showed that this phenotype was present up to 5.5 months, it remains to be established whether 22q11DS neurons will recover following maturation, homeostatic events or integration into circuits with interneurons. Moreover, future studies should elucidate if this excitability defect is related to the higher prevalence of seizures in 22q11DS 55 . Nonetheless, such changes could shape the formation of cortical circuits and contribute to disease susceptibility. Interestingly, treatment with the antipsychotics raclopride, sulpiride, and olanzapine in vitro, which modulate neuronal excitability 51,56,57 , rescued the RMP deficit. Several reports have now confirmed an association between the LTCC CACNA1C gene and neurodevelopmental disorders 25,58 . Interestingly, by contrast to the reduced [Ca 2+ ] i in 22q11DS, we recently reported increased [Ca 2+ ] i in Timothy syndrome, a monogenic ASD 23 . Interestingly, alterations in both LTCC function can be efficiently rescued within minutes by the antipsychotics. The modulation of LTCC by D2 receptors in neurons is well established, and blocking of D2 receptors can increase the activity of LTCC by multiple pathways 27,48 . Due to their inverse agonist effects 59 , these drugs could also decrease the tonic signaling from dopamine receptors in the absence of dopamine or, especially in the case of second generation drugs such as olanzapine, exert an effect on excitability by modulating non-dopaminergic receptors, such as 5-HT receptors 60 . Lastly, we want to note that this class of drugs has complex effects on neurons and that the hyperpolarization rescue may be unrelated to antipsychotic response in patients.</p>
<p>We found that heterozygous loss of DGCR8 is sufficient to phenocopy the functional defect in 22q11DS neurons. Interestingly, we observed only a modest reduction in the microRNA processing DGCR8 gene in 22q11DS neurons. However, several studies have reported less-than-expected downregulation of DGCR8 mRNA in heterozygotes cell cultures, which is thought to be due to homeostatic mechanisms. DGCR8 works in a complex with an RNAse, DROSHA, and regulates the expression of many transcripts 30 . Thereby, any level of alteration in DGCR8 would presumably have downstream effects on protein production and, potentially, neuronal physiology. Exogenously expressing DGCR8 rescued these defects in an isogenic line but only partially in 22q11DS. Future studies should comprehensively investigate the transcriptional overlap between 22q11DS and DGCR8 +/-and identify the microRNA(s), which may lead to the above functional changes. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether any other regulatory 22q11.2 locus regions influence these deficits. Lastly, the genomic complexity of this disease makes it likely that other genes in the locus contribute to these neuronal defects.</p>
<p>Overall, the transcriptional and physiological data in 22q11DS neurons suggest a link at the cellular level between several pathways that have been independently associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in previous studies. Moreover, transcriptional changes in 22q11.2DS neurons are also enriched for genes associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and ASD. It is therefore possible that similar to 22q11DS, other disorders on the schizophrenia or autism spectrum may display convergence of multiple signaling defects in pathways suggested by GWAS.</p>
<p>Despite the variable clinical phenotypic expression in the 22q11DS patient group, the cellular phenotypes were robust and reproducible across subjects and lines. Our analyses in hiPS cell-derived neurons focused on identifying molecular or cellular features specific to 22q11.2 deletion instead of the associated clinical phenotypes. Larger samples are needed for reliably estimate genotype-phenotype associations. Given the distinct clinical phenotypes of schizophrenia and ASD, it will be interesting to expand this work in a larger sample to determine whether one can distinguish molecular pathways unique to each clinical condition, as well as to identify the potential contribution of genetic background, including polygenic risk for schizophrenia. Future studies should also identify the molecular mechanism downstream of DGCR8 that lead to these cellular phenotypes, as well as the role for the pharmacological modulation by antipsychotics.</p>
<p>By identifying disease-relevant cellular phenotypes and demonstrating convergence at the cellular level of multiple pathways associated independently with neurodevelopmental disorders, we provide novel insights into the neurobiological pathways underlying the development of mental illness in 22q11DS. These findings support the value of a major mutational model for elucidating the biology of complex neuropsychiatric disorders and open the avenue for uncovering therapeutics.</p>
<p>Human fibroblast cells were reprogrammed using the Sendai virus-based CytoTune iPS 2.0 kit (CytoTune 2.0, Invitrogen, A16517). Fibroblasts were plated in six-well plates 2 days prior to transduction to achieve a density of 2e5-3e5 cells per well. Cells were then transduced with the indicated set of Sendai vectors at a MOI of 5-5-3 (KOS-Myc-Klf4). Virus was removed after 24 hours and cells were cultured in fibroblast medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, 16000-044) in DMEM (Gibco, 10569-010) for a total of 7 days, with media changes every other day. On day 7 after transduction, cells were harvested with TrypLE (Gibco, 16563-029) and plated in the fibroblast medium onto truncated recombinant human Vitronectin (VTN-N, Gibco, A14700)-coated plates. The following day, fibroblast medium was changed to Essential 8 Medium (Gibco, A1517001), and cells were fed daily until day 20-22. For further culture, individual colonies were manually dissected and transferred to fresh Vitronectin coated dishes. Once hiPS cell clones were established, they were routinely cultured on Vitronectin coated dishes in Essential 8 medium, and cells were split every 4-5 days using 0.5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575-020) as previously described 22 . hiPS cell clones/lines were also generated using retroviruses or non-integrating episomal vectors from fibroblasts (see Supplementary Table 2 for details). We did not observe any systematic differences between cells reprogrammed by the two methods. Lines from 22q11DS and control subjects were reprogrammed in batches. Some of the hiPS cell lines used in this study were extensively characterized previously 23,61 using immunostaining with anti-NANOG and TRA 2-49/6E antibodies, karyotyping, generation of teratoma in nude mice and mapping of viral integration sites (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Validation of hiPS cell integrity, including verification of genome integrity and deletion size by high density SNP arrays for all hiPS cell lines, is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1b,c. Cultures were regularly tested for mycoplasma and maintained mycoplasma free.</p>
<p>A total of 43 hiPS cell lines were generated from 15 healthy subjects and 16 22q11DS patients. Approval for this study was obtained from the Stanford IRB panel and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. hiPS cells were cultured as previously described 20,62 . Briefly, hiPS cells were cultured on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders (EmbryoMax PMEF; Millipore) in hiPS cell medium containing DMEM/F12 (1:1, Life Technologies, 11330), knockout serum (20%, Life Technologies, 10828), non-essential amino acids (1 mM, Life Technologies, 11140), GlutaMax (1: 200, Life Technologies, 35050), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, M3148), penicillin and streptomycin (1:100, Life Technologies, 15070), and supplemented with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 10 ng ml -1 diluted in 0.1% BSA; R&amp;D Systems). Alternatively, feeder-free hiPS cells were maintained on six-well plates coated with recombinant human vitronectin (VTN-N, Gibco, A14700) in Essential 8 medium (Life Technologies, A1517001), and passaged with 0.5 mM EDTA (Life Technologies, 15575).</p>
<p>The generation of hCS from hiPS cells was performed as previously described 19,20 . hiPS cell lines were randomly selected for differentiation from each genotype. To initiate the generation of hCS from hiPS cells cultured on feeders, intact hiPS cell colonies were lifted from the plates using dispase (0.35 mg ml -1 ) and transferred to ultralow-attachment plastic dishes (Corning) in hiPS cell medium supplemented with the two SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin (5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, P5499) and SB-431542 (10 μM, Tocris, 1614) and the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM, Selleckchem, S1049). For the first 5 days, the hiPS cell medium was changed every day and supplemented with dorsomorphin and SB-431542. On the sixth day in suspension, neural spheroids were transferred to neural medium containing neurobasal-A (Life Technologies, 10888), B-27 supplement without vitamin A (Life Technologies, 12587), GlutaMax (1:100, Life Technologies), penicillin and streptomycin (1:100, Life Technologies) and supplemented with the growth factors epidermal growth factor (20 ng ml -1 ; R&amp;D Systems) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 20 ng ml -1 ; R&amp;D Systems) until day 24. From day 25 to day 42, the neural medium was supplemented with the growth factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20 ng ml -1 , Peprotech) and neurotrophin 3 (20 ng ml -1 , Peprotech) with medium changes every other day. From day 43 onward, hCS were maintained in unsupplemented neurobasal-A medium (NM, Thermo Fisher, 1088022) with medium changes every 4-6 days.</p>
<p>For the generation of hCS from hiPS cells cultured on feeder-free conditions, hiPS cells were incubated with Accutase (Innovate Cell Technologies, AT-104) at 37 °C for 7 min, dissociated into single cells, and seeded into AggreWell 800 (STEMCELL Technologies, 34815) at a density of 3 × 10 6 single cells per well in Essential 8 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM, Selleckchem, S1049). After 24 h, spheroids were collected from each microwell by firmly pipetting (with a cut end of a P1000 tip) medium in the well up and down and transferring it into ultra-low-attachment plastic dishes (Corning, 3262) in Essential 6 medium (Life Technologies, A1516401) supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, P5499) and SB-431542 (10 μM, Tocris, 1614). From day 2 to day 6, Essential 6 medium was changed every day and supplemented with dorsomorphin and SB-431542. From the sixth day in suspension, neural spheroids were transferred to neural medium and maintained as described above.</p>
<p>The differentiation of hiPS cells into cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons was carried using a previously described and validated protocol 23 . Briefly, cellular aggregates were generated from hiPS cell colonies by enzymatic dissociation and kept in suspension for 5 days in hiPS cell media supplemented with two SMAD pathway inhibitors: dorsomorphin (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 μM) and SB-431542 (Tocris, 10 μM). On day 6 in vitro, cellular aggregates were plated on a polyornithine/laminin-rich substrate in neural media (NM) containing Neurobasal (Life Technologies, 10888), B-27 without vitamin A (Life Technologies, 12587), GlutaMax™ (1:100, Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (1:100, Life Technologies). The NM was supplemented with 20 ng ml -1 FGF2 (R&amp;D Systems) and 20 ng ml -1 EGF (R&amp;D Systems). After 10 days, neural rosettes were mechanically isolated and expanded in suspension as neurospheres for an additional 7 days before the initiation of differentiation by replating, FGF2/EGF withdrawal and the addition of 20 ng ml -1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Peprotech, 450-02) and 20 ng ml -1 NT3 (Peprotech, 450-03). The vast majority of neurons obtained with this protocol expressed cortical layer specific markers, as previously assessed by single cell quantitative PCR 23 .</p>
<p>For enzymatic dissociation of hCS for culture in monolayer we used a previously published protocol with some modifications 7 . Briefly, hCS were incubated for 15 min at 37˚C with 10 U/ml papain (Worthington) and gently triturated using a P1000 pipette in 100% FBS (Life Technologies, 16000). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in NM (centrifugations 200g for 7 min) NM supplemented with BDNF, NT3 and, for the first 24 h, 10 μM Y-27632. The cells were plated on glass coverslips (15 mm, Warner Instruments, 640713) coated with poly-L-ornithine (50 μg ml -1 , Sigma-Aldrich, P3655) and laminin (5 μg ml -1 , Sigma-Aldrich, L2020) at a density of 150,000 cells per coverslip. Cells were infected with either an AAV-DJ-hSyn1::YFP, AAV-DJ-hSyn1::mCherry, or pLV-EF1α-hDGCR8::YFP, pLV_EF1α-YFP for 2 d for experiments.</p>
<p>hCS were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, washed in PBS and transferred to 30% sucrose for 2-3d. Subsequently, they were rinsed and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) and 30% sucrose (1:1) and embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek OCT Compound 4583, Sakura Finetek) and stored at -80 °C. For immunofluorescence, 12-14 μm-thick sections were cut using a Leica cryostat.</p>
<p>Neurons plated on 15 mm coverslips (Warner Instruments) and grown in 24-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 m at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS and incubated in blocking solution (3% BSA diluted in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 (Millipore Sigma, T9284-100ML), 10% NDS (Abcam, ab7475)) for 1 h. Samples were then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C, and then washed three times in PBS at room temperature before incubation with secondary antibodies. Alexa Fluor dyes (Life Technologies) were used at 1:1,000 dilution, and nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258 (dilution 1:10,000; Thermo Fisher Science, H3569) Samples were mounted for microscopy on glass coverslips, using Aquamount (Polysciences, 18606), and imaged on a Zeiss M1 Axioscope with a 10×, 20×, 40× or 63× objective. The following antibodies were used: anti-MAP2 (guinea pig, Synaptic Systems 188004, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-DRD2 (rabbit, Frontier Institute, D2R-Rb-Af960; previously Frontier Institute, D2R-Rb-Af750, 1:300 dilution), anti-VGLUT1 (rabbit, Synaptic Systems: 135302, 1:500 dilution), and anti-CTIP2 (rat, Abcam, AB18465, 1:300 dilution). See refs 23,61 for details on immunostaining of hiPS cell lines: StemLight Pluripotency Antibody Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, 9656S, 1:200 dilution for all antibodies in kit) was used for OCT4, NANOG, SSEA-3, TRA-1-60, TRA-2-49.

<p>hiPS cells were electroporated in a solution containing 6 μg of S.p. HiFi Cas9 Nuclease (Integrated DNA Technologies) and 1.75 μg (50 pmol) of sgRNA were diluted with 20 μL of OtpiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 7.25 mM ATP and 11.8 mM MgCl 2 then it was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. During that, cells were harvested with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies). 400,000 cells were suspended with the prepared solution, then electropration was performed using 16-well Nucleocuvette Strip with 4D Nucleofector system (Lonza) using CA137 on P3 primary cell electroporation code. Immediately after electroporation, cells were transferred into one well of a matrigel-coated 6-well plate containing mTeSR media with 10 μM Y-27632 and cultured for 24 hours. Then, media was changed, and Y-27632 was removed after 48 hr of electroporation. Single cell cloning was started after 4 days of electroporation. Genotype was determined by PCR with primer set: Fwd: TTTAACTTGGTACCAGGGAATTGGA, Rev: TCATCCTTCTTATCAGCACTCTCAC followed by gel-extraction and Sanger sequencing performed by MCLab (South San Francisco, CA, USA) using a primer: gtcgccagtcacttaagctgag. TIDE analysis (https://tide.deskgen.com/) was performed with obtained chromatgrams in order to judge the genotypes of each clone. The synthetic sgRNA was purchased from Synthego with chemically modified nucleotides at the three terminal positions at both the 5' and 3' ends. Modified nucleotide contained 2'-O-methyl 3'-phosphorothioate. The genomic sgRNA target sequences is: gggcccacacgggagcggag.</p>

<p>Media from neuronal cultures at day 43 of differentiation was collected and stored with 7M HClO 4 (7 μl for 0.5 ml of media) at -80°C until further analysis. Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), glutamate (GLUT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the samples were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The media was centrifuged, and the supernatant was filtered. For the catecholamine measurements, the filtered supernatant was injected into the column. The HPLC mobile phase (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.13 mM EDTA, 2.3 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid, 20% MeOH, pH 6.0) was pumped through a chromatography column (SC-5ODS, Eicom, San Diego, CA) and a 50 μl sample loop at a flow rate of 0.23 ml/min. A graphite electrode (WE-3G, Eicom) set at a potential of 450 mV was used for electrochemical detection. For the amino acid measures, the filtered supernatant was diluted 100 times with 10% MeOH. Sixty μl of each sample was derivatized with 20 μl of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) solution for 2.5 minutes at room temperature and then injected into the column. The mobile phase was a 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mg/L EDTA, with 30% MeOH, which was pumped at a flow rate of 0.23 ml/min. The graphite electrode was set at +600 mV against an Ag-AgCl reference electrode. Quantification was achieved with a PowerChrom analysis system (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) using external standards (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Experiments were conducted blind to the disease status of the samples. The concentration was calculated by comparing the HPLC peak of each neurotransmitter in samples with the peak area of known concentrations of the standards analyzed on the same day. The levels of neurotransmitters were normalized to the total number of cells per well.</p>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed as previously described 23 . Experiments in the initial calcium phenotyping assay were conducted blind to the disease status. Cells used in calcium imaging experiments were from dissociated-hCS plated on coverslips (15 mm, Warner Instruments, 640713). Briefly, cells were loaded with 1 μM Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C in NM medium, washed with NM medium for 10 min and then transferred to a perfusion chamber (RC-20; Warner instruments) in low potassium Tyrode's solution (2 mM KCl: 129 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 30 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1% and Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.4) on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000U; Nikon). After imaging for 2 minutes (or 1 minute with a 2-minute baseline treatment of drug), a high potassium Tyrode's solution (High-KCl) (67 mM KCl: 67 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 30 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, 0.1% and Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.4) was applied. Imaging was performed at room temperature (∼25°C) on an epifluorescence microscope equipped with an excitation filter wheel and an automated stage. The

Neurons from dissociated-hCS, which were cultured for at least 5 days, were bathed in an external solution of BrainPhys neuronal medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 05790). Recording electrodes of borosilicate glass had a resistance of 7-15 MΩ when filled with internal solution containing the following: 145 mM K gluconate, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 mM Na-phosphocreatine. Command voltage protocols were generated and extracellular and whole cell data were collected using a 1550 A digitizer (Molecular Devices) and a 700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) and were acquired with the

<p>To determine if neurons are spontaneously firing, we analyzed current traces obtained in the cell-attached configuration at 0 mV holding potential. A neuron was considered as spontaneously active if an extracellular spike was detected within a two-minute recording window. Spikes were detected using a threshold of three standard deviations from the current mean. To minimize noise artifacts, traces were low-pass filtered (500 Hz, -3 dB, low pass gaussian filter) before analysis.</p>
<p>For spike train recordings in whole cell mode, neurons were held near -70 mV with steady current injections and 1 second current injections were given at 10 s intervals to elicit spike trains. Recordings were corrected for an estimated -15 mV liquid junction potential.</p>
<p>For recordings of calcium channel currents, an internal solution containing 110 mM CsMethylSO 3 , 30 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na 2 GTP, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM QX314-Cl, pH 7.2 with CsoH, 290 mOsm, was used. External solution contained 114 mM NaCl, 25 mM TEA-Cl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 4 mM BaCl2, 4 mM 4-aminopyridine, 10 mM HEPES, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4 with NaOH, 300 mOsm. In voltage clamp recordings, currents were leak subtracted using a -P/4 protocol. Between sweeps, cells were held at -70 mV.</p>
<p>For RMP recordings, the following drug applications were used: sulpiride (10 μM), raclopride (10 μM), and olanzapine (10 μM).</p>
<p>Simultaneous patch clamping and calcium imaging was performed using Fura-2 Pentapotassium salt (Thermofisher F1200) on dissociated-hCS neurons, alternately excited with two high-intensity LED devices (340 and 385 nm; Prizmatix, Israel). Experiments were conducted blind to the disease status of the samples. To minimize crosstalk between the 340 and 385 nm LEDs, two band-pass CHROMA excitation filters, ET340x and ET340x (Chroma) respectively, were situated immediately after the LEDs. The emission was collected with the rest of the 79001-filter set (DC= 400 nm, EM= 510 nm). Changes in fluorescence were acquired using Retiga ELECTRO CCD (Teledyne Q-imaging). Images were acquired at 1 frame per second for each wavelength. Both the camera frame rate and LED timing were trigger-controlled by an

<p>Whole cell patch clamp recordings were conducted in current-clamp or voltage-clamp mode, visualizing neurons using a Nikon Eclipse FN1 upright microscope and amplifying signals via a Multiclamp 700B (Axon Instruments). Experiments were conducted blind to the disease status of the samples in neurons at 50-70 days of differentiation in vitro. For recordings in current clamp, pipettes (3-5 megaohm resistance) were filled with an internal solution consisting of: 120 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM Mg 2 ATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, 10 mM Na 2 Phosphocreatine, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.25 with KOH, 290 mOsm.

For measuring calcium currents, 20 mM CaCl 2 was substituted for BaCl 2 .</p>
<p>Libraries were prepared using Truseq stranded RNA RiboZero Gold (Illumina) from rRNA depleted (RiboZero Gold, Illumina). 100-bp paired end reads were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Reads were mapped to hg38 with Gencode v25 annotation using

Genes with less than 10 reads in over 50% of samples per timepoint were discarded leaving 17,071 genes in the analysis. Outlying samples were identified by having a standardized sample network connectivity Z scores smaller than -2, and were removed 66 . <rs xml:id="12889698" type="software">Picard</rs> sequencing metrics (

These seqPCs were then included in the model to control for technical variation in the RNA sequencing. Batch effect were accounted for by either including batch as a covariate in the linear model (allowing for correct estimation of degrees of freedom) or by <rs xml:id="12889701" type="software" subtype="component" corresp="12889702">Combat</rs> function form the

</p>
<p>Sample identity was verified using the identity by descent (IBD) algorithm from
<rs xml:id="12889705" type="software">PLINK</rs> (<rs xml:id="12889706" type="version" corresp="12889705">1.09</rs>). IBD was calculated for each sample based on genotypes derived from the RNA-seq analysis and a threshold of PI_HAT&lt; 0.8 was set. Additionally, for each hiPS cell line, the sex was verified by detection of genes expressed by the Y-chromosome. To account for differences in gene expression caused by common variation associated with genetic ancestry, SNPs were called from the aligned reads using the
<rs xml:id="12889707" type="software" subtype="environment">GATK</rs> (v
<rs xml:id="12889708" type="version" corresp="12889707">3.3</rs>) <rs xml:id="12889709" type="software" subtype="component" corresp="12889707">Haplotype caller</rs> <rs xml:id="12889710" type="bibr">68</rs> . The results were then converted to plink format (v1.08) and filtered for quality (&lt; 5% missing values, minor allele frequency&lt; 0.05, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium&lt; 1e-6) 69 . MDS was calculated on the resulting high-quality SNPs which were combined with HapMap3.3 (hg38) to estimate genetic ancestry. Variance partitioning was performed using the
<rs xml:id="12889711" type="software" subtype="component" corresp="12889713">variancePartition</rs> package (v

</p>
<p>Batches were balanced for control and 22q11DS lines. However, within one of the batches the cases and controls were split and pooled separately and sequenced on different flow cells. To account for this, samples from both control and 22q11DS lines were re-sequenced at one time point (day 75). These samples were then included in the analysis while using a random variable to account for them being sequenced twice. Additionally, to estimate the effect of this splitting of samples on the DEG at each time point, a linear model was run measuring the interaction between the spilt batch and the presence of the 22q11.2 deletion on the differentially expressed genes. A significant interaction term would indicate that this batch had a significantly different effect on expression than the other batches. Moreover, in a case where the splitting had a large effect on observed gene expression levels, the expected distribution of the effect size of the interaction term should be right skewed. This expectation for a right skewed distribution results from the assumption that the splitting created a larger (positive) difference between the cases and controls which should lead to a right shifted or skewed distribution.</p>
<p>Differential expression was performed using CQN 70 normalized expression levels which account for gene length, library size, and G/C content. A mixed linear model was used to account for multiple samples coming from the same individual, hiPS cell line and differentiation as well as to account for samples which were sequenced more than once. Fixed covariates that were included were differentiation day, sex, batch, the first two PCs calculated for genetic ancestry and twenty sequencings PCs (SeqPCs; see above).

The parameters used were 1,000,000 permutations, a minimal set size of 30 and a maximal set size of 500. GO gene sets (v7.0) were downloaded from http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/. Gene sets with FDR&lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant.
</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes were tested for GWAS enrichment from ASD 32 , SCZ 33 , and ADHD 34 which are all associated with 22q11DS 8 . SNPs were assigned to a gene if they were within 10kb of a gene and were used. SNP heritability was estimated using a stratified LDscore (v1.0.0) regression 72 . Enrichment was then calculated as the proportion of SNP heritability accounted for by the DEG divided by the proportion of total SNPs within the DEG. Significance was tested using a jackknife method, followed by FDR correction. Enrichments with FDR&lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant.</p>

The analysis was run using the first batch of data and used 17,000 genes and an estimated 5% of genes being differentially expressed. The simulation was run 100 times using the edgeR differential expression method 74 with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 samples. Power was calculated for log fold changes of ranging from 0.25 to 1.5 which is equivalent to changes of ~18% to ~180% in expression level.

<p>Dissociations were done as previously described 22 . Dissociated cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.02% BSA and loaded onto a Chromium Single cell 3' chip (with an estimated recovery of 10,000 cells per channel) to generate gel beads in emulsion (GEMs). scRNA-seq libraries were prepared with the Chromium Single cell 3' GEM, Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2 (10x Genomics, PN: 120237).

We excluded genes that were not expressed in at least three cells. We excluded cells with less than 500 detected genes, as well as those with a proportion of mitochondrial reads higher than 30%. Gene expression was then normalized using a global-scaling normalization method (normalization.method= "LogNormalize", scale.factor= 10,000), and the 2,000 most variable genes were then selected (selection.method= "versust").
