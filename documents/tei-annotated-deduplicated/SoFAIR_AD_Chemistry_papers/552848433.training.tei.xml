<p>The understanding of the effect generated by small differences of the organic ligands on the molecular and supramolecular arrangement of coordination polymers (CPs) is a key factor to control their properties. Therefore, the study of structurally related ligands differing in some factors inter alia functional group orientation, length, or functionality is a crucial task for crystal engineers. In this contribution, the reactions between Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O, α-acetamidocinnamic acid (HACA) and different N,N -donor spacers with increasing length (pyrazine, pyz; 4,4'-bipyridine, 4,4'-bipy; 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 1,2bpe), as well as additional functionalities (4,4'-azopyridine, 4,4'-azpy) have been successfully performed. Their crystal structures have been elucidated revealing a family of ladder-type 1D CPs showing molecular arrays with single pillars for {[Cd 2 ( μ-ACA) 2 (ACA) 2 (pyz)(H 2 O) 2 ] •2EtOH} n ( 1 ), and double pillars for</p>
<p>Remarkably, the effect of the addition of the azo group in 4 compared with 2 and 3 has led to a CP with the same molecular arrangement but different crystal packing, allowing the introduction of one non-coordinated 4,4'-azpy and nine water molecules. Finally, their solid-state UV-Vis and photoluminescence have been measured observing their blue-emitting properties.</p>
<p>The rational design of coordination polymers (CPs) by means of crystal engineering has emerged as a hot topic during the last decades [1][2][3] , providing a tool for chemist to design specific arrangements with potential applications in fluorescence [ 4 , 5 ], magnetism [ 6 , 7 ], or catalysis [8] , among others [ 9 , 10 ].</p>
<p>In this context, d 10 metal ions have been specially utilized owing to their close-shell configuration, which provides variable geometries and therefore, structural diversity to the resulting CPs [ 11 , 12 ]. Among them, those presenting bigger ionic radii such Cd(II) offer a wide range of coordination numbers oscillating between two and eight [13] . Their size combined with its relatively high electronegativity compared with the rest of d 10 metal ions [ 14 , 15 ], confers it the possibility to reach a larger number of coordination bonds with more ionic character, which is pursued for avoiding heavy atom effects in fluorescence materials [16] . However, this structural diversity requires of a precise control of the synthetic conditions such as solvent [17] , ratio of reactants [18] , or temperature [19] , in order to achieve the desired CPs.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the approach consisting on the preparation of CPs with the same molecular arrangement by changing some characteristics of their starting ligands (mainly functional groups and/or ligand lengths) has been successfully employed to prepare diverse families of CPs and studying their properties [20][21][22] . Nonetheless, these small changes can also influence the structure of CPs leading to the obtention of products with different molecular and/or supramolecular structures [ 23 , 24 ]. Therefore, given our previous experience in the preparation of ACA-based complexes containing Zn(II) and Cd(II) as metal nodes [25][26][27][28][29] , in this contribution we have prepared four Cd(II) CPs containing ACA as a common ligand and four different N,N -donor spacers (pyrazine, pyz; 4,4'-bipyridine, 4,4'-bipy; 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 1,2-bpe; 4,4'-azopyridine, 4,4'-azpy) presenting different lengths, ranging from ∼2.80 Å to 9.44 Å, as well as an additional functionality in 4,4'-azpy. From the reactions between Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O, carried on a Thermo Scientific Flash 20 0 0 CHNS Analyzer. FTIR-ATR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer spectrometer, equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory model MKII Golden Gate with diamond window in the range 40 0 0-50 0 cm -1 . 1 H, 13 C{ 1 H} and DEPT-135 NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 300 MHz spectrometer in DMSO-d 6 solutions at RT. All the chemical shifts ( δ) are given in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (Me 4 Si) as internal standard. Solid-state UV-Vis spectra were carried out using a Cary 40 0 0 spectrophotometer between 20 0-80 0 nm. Solid-state photoluminescence measurements were recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram was generated using

<p>An EtOH solution (8 mL) of Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O (100 mg, 0.375 mmol) was added dropwise to an EtOH solution (10 mL) of HACA (156 mg, 0.760 mmol) and pyz (15.1 mg, 0.189 mmol) at RT. The solution was stirred during 24 h, and then it was kept evaporating at RT during 10 days until a white crystalline solid precipitated. The resulting product was filtered, washed with 10 mL of cold Et 2 O (repeated twice), and dried under vacuum. Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained after layering 2 mL of hexane above 2 mL of a solution of the reaction mixture and kept it undisturbed at RT for four days.</p>

<p>For 2 and 3 , a hot Milli-Q water solution (1.0 mL, 2 ; 3.0 mL, 3 ) of Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O (50.0 mg, 0.188 mmol) was added dropwise to a hot Milli-Q water solution (4.0 mL) of HACA (77.0 mg, 0.375 mmol) and 0.188 mmol of the corresponding N,N -donor spacer (4,4'-bipy, 2 ; 1,2-bpe, 3 ). The preparation of 4 was done using the same molar ratio as for 2 and 3 but starting from 0.5 mL of a hot Milli-Q water solution of Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O (10 mg, 0.038 mmol), and a hot solution of Milli-Q water/EtOH (1.25 mL/25.0 μL) with the ligands. The resulting solutions of 2 -4 were kept at 90 °C during 2 h and then, they were cooled down to RT using a temperature ramp (SI: Fig. S1), obtaining single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction when the cooling ramp was completed for 2 and 3 , while the single crystals of 4 were obtained after keeping the vials undisturbed at RT for three days once the cooling ramp was completed. All the crystals were filtered, washed twice with 5 mL of acetone, and dried under vacuum.</p>

<p>The four CPs were prepared from the reaction of Cd(OAc) 2 •2H 2 O, HACA and their corresponding N,N -donor spacer (pyz, 1 ; 4,4'-bipy, 2 ; 1,2-bpe, 3 ; 4,4'-azpy, 4 ). All the CPs were obtained as crystalline materials, which were used for the further characterization and photophysical properties measurements. Compound 1 was prepared using a 1:2:0.5 molar ratio in EtOH at RT. Otherwise, compounds 2 -4 were obtained using a 1:2:1 molar ratio and Milli-Q water, starting the reactions at 90 °C and following a cooling ramp (SI: Fig. S1). Interestingly, the addition of a 1.7% of EtOH to the reaction media in 4 results in a remarkable enhancement of the quality of the crystals. Furthermore, all the assays for obtaining 1 using the same synthetic conditions as for the obtention of 2 -4 yielded the monomer [Cd(ACA) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] [25] independently of the utilized stoichiometry. Otherwise, the use of EtOH resulted in the obtention of 1 , and the increase of equivalents of pyz lead to the same product with lower yields.</p>
<p>Compounds 1 -4 were characterized by PXRD, EA, FTIR-ATR, 1 H, 13 C{ 1 H}, DEPT-135 NMR spectroscopies, and single crystal X-ray diffraction method. Phase purity of the bulk samples of 1-4 were verified by PXRD (SI: Figs. S2-S5). Moreover, the EA agree with the proposed formulas. In the FTIR-ATR spectra we observe the bands attributable to the ACA and N,N -donor spacers. The absence of a strong band at 1637 cm -1 corresponding to ν(COOH) HACA , indicates that the HACA ligand is deprotonated in all the CPs. The four spectra display the characteristic bands between 1547-1484 cm -1 for ν as (COO) and 1416-1370 cm -1 for ν s (COO), whose difference results in the value [ 36 , 37 ], being 146 and 100 cm -1 ( 1 ), 155 and 104 cm -1 ( 2 ), 160 and 97 cm -1 ( 3 ), and 146 and 129 cm -1 ( 4 ), which suggest bidentate bridged-chelated ( μ 2 -η 1 : η 1 ), and chelated ( μ 2 -η 2 ) coordination modes of the carboxylate groups. Additionally, other bands of the ACA corresponding to the ν(N-H) and ν(C = O) signals have also been identified, as well as the typical bands from the aromatic rings ( ν(C = C/C = N) and δ(C = C/C = N)) from either ACA and the corresponding spacers [38] . Furthermore, the presence of a broad band between 3355-2862 cm -1 ( 1 ) and 3389-1639 cm -1 ( 4 ) has been attributed to ν(O-H) of solvent molecules (SI: Figs. S6-S9).</p>
<p>The 1 H NMR spectra of 1 -4 were recorded in DMSO-d 6 solutions to ascertain the molar ratio between the ligands (SI: Figs. S10-S13). All the spectra display a signal between 9.18-9.15 ppm attributable to the amide H-atom, while the signals corresponding to the N,N -donor spacers appeared at 8.66 ( 1 ), 8.73 and 7.84 ( 2 ), 8.61-7.55 ( 3 ), and 8.88 and 7.81 ( 4 ). In addition, the aromatic and the alkene hydrogen atoms from ACA are found between 7.50-7.25 ppm, while the methyl H-atoms are shown around 1.95 ppm. The 1 H NMR spectra of the four CPs confirm their different ACA:spacer ratio, being 4:1 ( 1 ), 4:2 ( 2 and 3 ), and 4:3 ( 4 ), which is in agreement with the elucidated crystal structures [38] .</p>
<p>The 13 C{ 1 H} and DEPT-135 NMR spectra of 1 -4 have also been recorded using DMSO-d 6 as solvent, observing the typical signals corresponding to the carbonyl (171.5-171.3 ppm) and carboxylate (168.2-168.1 ppm) carbon atoms from ACA in the downfield region, followed by the carbon atoms from the N,N -donor linkers, which appeared between 151.9 and 130.7 ppm. In this region, the aromatic and alkene carbon atoms from ACA are also shown between 135.2 and 128.9 ppm, while the methyl carbon atoms from ACA appeared in the up-field region of the spectra around 23.0 ppm (SI: Figs. S14-S17).</p>
<p>The compound belongs to the monoclinic P2 1 /c space group. It consists of a 1D zig-zag CP expanded along the [010] direction through dimeric secondary building units (SBUs) connected by a pyz linker acting as a single pillar ( Fig. 1 a). These SBUs are formed by two equivalent Cd(II) centers with [CdO 6 N] cores connected by two ACA ligands presenting a μ 2 -η 1 : η 1 coordination mode. In addition, a pair of μ 2 -η 2 ACA, a water and a pyz molecules complete the coordination sphere of both Cd(II) centers, displaying a dis-torted capped trigonal prismatic geometry ( Fig. 1 b; SI: Table S1). The crystal structure also contains two equivalent non-coordinated EtOH molecules, which are placed on voids with an accessible volume of 48.61 Å 3 (1.8% of the unit cell volume) [34] generated by the supramolecular scaffold of the CP. In addition, their bond lengths and bond angles oscillate between 2.279(8)-2.451(8) Å and 54.9(2)-159.9(3) °, showing similar values than other Cd(II) laddertype CPs presenting pyz ligands as single pillars ( Table 2 ) [ 39 , 40 ].</p>
<p>The intramolecular interactions of 1 are based on a C-H •••O interaction between an o -H from pyz and a carboxylate oxygen atom from the μ 2 -η 2 ACA ligands ( Fig. 1 a). The intermolecular interactions form 2D layers along the (200) plane ( Fig. 1 c) resulting in a hxl topology. This layers are mainly originated by the coordinated water molecules that joint together the polymeric chains, forming two H-bonds with one oxygen atom from the μ 2 -η 1 : η 1 ACA ligand and one oxygen atom from the μ 2 -η 2 carboxylate group as acceptors. The 2D plane is also supported by H-bonds promoted by the NH and C = O groups from the amide moieties from ACA, which interact with nearby μ 2 -η 1 : η 1 linked oxygen atoms from carboxylate ACA ligands and non-coordinated EtOH molecules, as well as C-H •••π interactions involving the EtOH molecules and the polymeric chains ( Fig. 1 d). S1). Moreover, the bond lengths and bond angles range be-</p>

<p>The different molecular arrangement of the studied CPs consisting on the presence of single ( 1 ) or double pillars ( 2 -4 ) could be attributed to the difference in pKa values of the utilized N,N -donor spacers (pyz, 0.6 [45] ; 4,4'-bipy, 3.17 [46] ; 1,2-bpe, 3.89 [47] ; 4,4'azpy, 2.19 [48] ). These values show that pyz presents the less coordinating ability and therefore, their competition with the coordina-tion of water molecules should be higher than in the rest of linkers [49] . These results are in line with the observations regarding the obtention of 1 , since the trials to synthesize it using the same synthetic conditions as for the rest of compounds always promote the coordination of water molecules instead of pyz, leading to the</p>

<p>The supramolecular scaffold of 2 and 3 form 2D layers along the (110) plane ( Fig. 3 5 ; Fig. 3 c, 3 f and4 ).</p>
<p>In compound 4 , the azo group of 4,4'-azpy promotes a change in its crystal packing compared with 2 and 3 , allowing the introduction of one non-coordinated 4,4'-azpy and nine water molecules into the supramolecular network ( Figs. 3 and5 ). This effect has been previously observed by Kitagawa et al. [50] , and is attributed to the electronic repulsions between the lone pair electrons of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and the azo groups. Therefore, the non-coordinated water molecules drive the supramolecular assembly connecting the polymeric chains via H-bonding with the NH and C = O moieties from contiguous amide groups and the carboxylate groups from ACA ligands of nearby chains, extending a Perpendicular distance of H to ring plane J. b Angle between Cg(J)-H vector and ring J normal. c X-H •••Cg(J) angle. d Angle of the X-H bond with the Pi-plane (Perpendicular = 90 °, Parallel = 0 °). f Centroid-centroid distance. g Dihedral angle between the ring planes. h Offset angles: angle between Cg(I)-Cg(J) vector and normal to plane I, angle between Cg(I)-Cg(J) vector and normal to plane J ( β = γ , when α = 0). i Perpendicular distance of Cg(I) on plane J and perpendicular distance of Cg(J) on plane I (equal when α = 0). j Horizontal displacement or slippage between Cg(I) and Cg(J) (equal for both centroids when α = 0). 2 : Cg(1) = C(4) C( 5) C( 6) C( 7) C( 8 the structure through the (110) plane ( Fig. 3 g). In addition, the water molecules form supramolecular patterns of H-bonds between them ( Fig. 3</p>
<p>The solid-state UV-Vis and fluorescence measurements of complexes 1 -4 have been recorded. Their absorption spectra show overlapped bands centered at 252 and 302 nm ( 1 ), 264 and 293 nm ( 2 ), 276 and 329 nm ( 3 ), and 284 and 345 nm ( 4 ) (SI: Fig. S18). Moreover, compound 4 presents an additional absorption band centered at 470 nm. The comparison of these results with the corresponding free ligands shows that the common peaks of 1 -4 should be mainly attributed to a combination of absorptions of the ππ * transitions of the former ligands of each CP, where a higher contribution of the ACA ligand ( λ max (HACA) = 246 nm, 294 nm) should be associated to the first band, and the second band might be more dependent of the N,N -donor linkers [51][52][53][54] . In addition, the band centered at 470 nm in 4 has been attributed to the n-π * transitions of the 4,4'-azpy ligand, mainly centered in the azo chromophore [55] . S2). Besides, the irradiation of the complexes at their second absorption band ( λ exc = 315 nm) show the emission of similar unstructured bands but with a lower range, probably due to the use of a less energetic ir-radiation ( Fig. 6 b). Finally, when compound 4 was irradiated at 470 nm, the emission of the azo chromophore has been observed, displaying a peak at 484 nm ( Fig. 6 b). Considering these excitations, the resulting emission colors according to the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagrams when irradiated at 262 nm are blue ribbon ( 1 -3 ) and azure radiance ( 4 ), while when λ exc = 315 nm the observed color was electric violet ( 1 -4 ), and the excitation of the azo chromophore of 4 at 470 nm results in a cyan color (SI: Fig. S19).</p>
<p>We have successfully synthesized four Cd(II) CPs, whose structural elucidation revealed the formation of 1D ladder-type arrangements with single ( 1 ) and doble ( 2-4 ) pillars depending on the N,N -donor spacer coordination ability (pyz &lt; 4,4'-azpy &lt; 4,4'bipy &lt; 1,2-bpe). Interestingly, the incorporation of an azo group in the spacer of 4 , resulted in a different crystal packing owing to the repulsion between the N = N group and the oxygen atoms from the carboxylate ACA ligands, leading to the introduction of one non-coordinated 4,4'-azpy and nine water molecules in their supramolecular structure. The CPs 2 -4 have been synthesized using Milli-Q water, while 1 has been prepared in EtOH owing to the competition between the pyz and water molecules, which lead to [Cd(ACA) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] when the reaction was performed in Milli-Q water. In addition, the solid-state photophysical properties show the combined emission of the ACA and the corresponding N,N -donor linkers displaying emissions in the blue range, showing different tonalities from violet to cyan. Therefore, this work contributes to the understanding of the influence of little modifications of N,Ndonor based spacers on the structure and photophysical properties of Cd(II) CPs.</p>
