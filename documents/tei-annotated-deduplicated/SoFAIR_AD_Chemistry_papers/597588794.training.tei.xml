<p>Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405 nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited-state reactivity served to activate, by single-electron reduction, strong CÀ F, CÀ Cl, and CÀ O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron-rich substrates (E red &lt; À 3.0 V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited-state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.</p>
<p>The activation of inert substrates is a substantial challenge.</p>
<p>Fluoro-and chloro-arenes, alkyl chlorides, [1] and unsubstituted arenes [2] typically require strongly reducing alkali metals, transition metal complexes, or electrochemical methods. [3] Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered effective solutions under mild conditions, but traditional photocatalysts are limited by their relatively low reducing power (&gt; À 2.0 V, Figure 1a). [4] Innovative light-driven systems have been developed to overcome this limitation (Figure 1b). [5] The consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) manifold, [6] in which a second photon is used to excite a previously photogenerated radical anion, proved effective for the reduction of challenging substrates, including aryl and alkyl chlorides. [7] This reducing system served also for realizing a photochemical Birch reduction of unfunctionalized arenes. [8] Other methods, based on electrochemically mediated photoredox catalysis (e-PRC) [9] or proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), [10] were suitable to activate aryl chlorides and generate the corresponding radicals amenable to further trasformations. [10a] A versatile approach used anionic organic catalysts [11] that, upon light excitation, could activate challenging substrates via singleelectron transfer (SET) reduction, [12] including aryl fluorides. [12d] Anionic catalysts have the distinct advantage of acquiring a high redox potential in the excited state (&lt; À 3 V vs SCE), along with a greater ability to absorb visible light. While each of these methods permit the reduction of specific functional groups, a general and practical protocol based on a single catalyst capable to activate a large variety of inert substrates is not available. Herein, we report a highly reducing anionic indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon activation with visible light, can consistently activate an array of strong bonds through SET reduction (Figure 1c).</p>
<p>Our design plan was motivated by recent reports from our laboratory [13] and others [12c-e] demonstrating that sulfur anions, upon excitation, can serve as strong SET reductants to activate substrates and generate radicals (see section B in the Supporting Information for additional details on catalyst design). We surmised that the electron-rich thiolate anion I, generated in situ upon deprotonation of the cyclic thioamide catalyst C1, would access a highly reducing excited state I* under light irradiation (Figure 2a). SET activation of a difficult-to-reduce electron-rich C(sp 2 )À X substrate to generate aryl radicals was considered a significant testbed. γ-Terpinene, acting as a hydrogen atom donor, would quench the aryl radical via hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) affording the reduced product 3. The resulting cyclohexadienyl radical III would then reduce the sulfur-centered radical II via an SET, thus turning over the catalyst. [14] The cyclic thioamides C1-C4 were tested as catalysts in the hydrodechlorination and defluorination of 4-chloroanisole 1 a (E red = À 2.9 V vs. SCE) and 4-fluoroanisole 2 a (E red = &lt; À 3.0 V vs. SCE). The reactions were conducted using 5 mol % of the catalyst, Cs 2 CO 3 as the base (2 equiv., needed to form the thiolate anion I in situ) and γ-terpinene under 405 nm light irradiation (Figure 2b). The reduction of 1 a was performed in DMSO, while N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used with aryl fluoride 2 a. Cyclic 1-methylindoline-2-thione C1 offered the best results, affording the anisole product 3 a in 80 % yield upon reduction of both the C(sp 2 )À Cl and C(sp 2 )-F bond. Structurally related thioamides C2-3 also catalyzed the dechlorination reaction of 1 a, albeit with slightly diminished yield, while the analogous oxygen-containing catalyst C4 was ineffective. However, catalyst C1 clearly outperformed other analogues in the activation of 4-fluoroanisole 2 a. Control experiments showed that the presence of catalyst, light and the base were all essential for reactivity (Figure 2b, entry 2). Other inorganic bases, including K 2 CO 3 (3 a formed in 75 % yield), could be used, but the results did not exceed those obtained ) upon irradiation at 350 nm and its intercept with the absorption spectrum at 375 nm, with a 0-0 transition energy (E 0,0 ) of 3.3 eV.

<p>with Cs 2 CO 3 . Decreasing the amount of Cs 2 CO 3 to 0.5 or 1 equiv. resulted in a significant decrease in reactivity (detailed optimization studies can be found in Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The reaction proceeded poorly in the absence of γ-terpinene (entry 3), while replacement with i-Pr 2 NEt gave moderate yield (entry 4). Sodium formate (HCO 2 Na) was a suitable H donor, since product 3 a was obtained in 70 % yield (entry 5). The successful use of hydrogen donors other than γ-terpinene, along with the possibility of successfully performing the Birch reduction of unfunctionalized arenes (see the discussion below), is congruent with the proposed SET-based mechanism and rules out a possible halogen transfer mechanism mastered by γ-terpinene. [15] Catalyst C1 is an air-stable solid that can be prepared on gram-scale through oxygen-sulfur exchange of the commercially available N-methyl oxindole C4 (Figure 2c). Treatment of C1 with Cs 2 CO 3 (2 equiv.) resulted in rapid formation of the thiolate salt I, as confirmed by 1 H NMR studies. While catalyst C2 was also fully deprotonated under these conditions, C3 and C4 exhibited a much lower propensity for deprotonation (see section E1 in the Supporting Information).</p>
<p>We then performed investigations to gain mechanistic insights. Absorption spectroscopic investigations established that catalyst C1 does not absorb visible light, while the addition of Cs 2 CO 3, leading to anion I, induced a clear bathochromic shift in the visible region (Figure 2d). We also ruled out any ground-state association between catalyst C1 and substrate 1 a. Upon irradiation at 350 nm of a DMSO solution of catalyst C1 and Cs 2 CO 3 (in situ formation of I), we detected emission centered at 401 nm (Figure 2e). This confirmed that the deprotonated catalyst I could access an electronically excited state. From the crossing point of the emission and absorption profiles at 375 nm, a 0-0 transition energy (E 0,0 ) of 3.3 eV could be inferred. [16] Next, the ground-state redox properties of the deprotonated catalyst I were determined by cyclic voltammetry (Figure 2f). A first irreversible oxidation peak was found at + 0.01 V vs Ag/ AgCl in DMSO, which was assigned to the formation of the sulfur-radical III. [17] Applying the Rehm-Weller formalism, [18] the redox potential of the excited thiolate [E(I * /[I À ]*)] was estimated as À 3.38 V vs SCE. This confirmed that the anion of catalyst C1 acquires a strongly reducing power upon excitation.</p>
<p>Using the conditions described in Figure 2b entry 1, we then tested the reducing power of our light-driven organocatalytic platform (Figure 3). We first evaluated the possibility to activate aryl chlorides 1. A series of difficult-toreduce electron-rich substrates underwent hydrodechlorination to afford the corresponding arenes in high yields (products 3 a-d). Bis-chloroanisole was doubly-dechlorinated (3 e) while electron neutral and electron deficient aryl chlorides, including the antidepressant drug moclobemide, were reduced efficiently (adducts 3 f-k). To further test the generality of organocatalyst C1, we then targeted aryl phosphates 4 [9c,10a] and alkyl chlorides 5. [7e,12c,20] These substrates are particularly recalcitrant to SET activation because of their low redox potentials (E red &lt; À 2.8 V vs. SCE). Electron-rich and electron-neutral phosphates were reduced in good yields to afford products 3 a, 3 h, 3 l, and 3 m, while primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides 5 all afforded the reduced adducts in high yields (products 7 af). We then focused on the challenging reductive defunctionalization of aryl fluorides 2. Their activation is hampered by both the poor leaving group ability of the fluoride and the highly negative reduction potentials (E red &lt; À 3 V vs. SCE). Previous catalytic methods suitable for the activation of electron-rich aryl fluorides [12d] usually required harsh conditions, including UV light irradiation [21a] or a strong base. [21b,c] Our protocol could achieve the activation of neutral or electron-rich substrates under mild conditions, affording the hydrodefluorination products in high yield (adducts 3 a, 3 l, 3 o-3 q). Interestingly, addition of water allowed us to reduce electron-poor aryl fluorides too, leading to products 3 f, 3 i, 3 j and 3 r. [22] To the best of our knowledge, those substrates were out of reach of previously reported photochemical reducing protocols. Some aryl fluorides proved unreactive under our conditions, and they are listed in Figure S6. Synthetically, it is worth noting the tolerance of this highly reducing protocol towards a variety of functional groups, including unprotected amines (adducts 3 o-3 p), amides (3 h, 3 k), a carboxylic acid (3 r), an ester (3 j), a nitril (3 i), and a boron-derivative (3 g).</p>
<p>We then evaluated the potential of catalyst C1 to promote the light-driven Birch reduction of inactivated arenes 6. [8,23] This process is complicated by the absence of leaving groups within the aromatic substrates, which might result in an unproductive back-electron transfer. Our catalytic system, when using a NMP/H 2 O solvent mixture, successfully activated naphthalene derivatives and phenanthrene, leading to the desired di-hydro products 8 a-8 f in good yields. N-Me-Indole, anisole, and benzene were also converted to the corresponding dienes (adducts 8 g-i).</p>
<p>A list of reactive or poorly reactive substrates is provided in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. Overall, these results proved that catalyst C1 can activate, via SET reduction, electron-rich arenes with very negative redox potentials (E red &lt; À 3.3 V vs SCE).</p>
<p>We then used the highly reducing power of catalyst C1 to functionalize aromatic substrates (Figure 4). Phosphorylation of aryl chlorides 1 using trimethyl phosphite P(OMe) 3 was successfully achieved under standard conditions and using HCO 2 Na instead of γ-terpinene.</p>
<p>Aryl chlorides with electron-rich substituents at the ortho, meta, and para positions all reacted smoothly to afford the corresponding products 9 a-9 i. Electron-neutral (adducts 9 j-9 m), electron-poor (9 n-9 o), bicyclic, and heterocyclic (9 p-9 u) moieties were tolerated well. High functional group tolerance was observed, allowing the use of alkyl alcohols (9 h), amides (9 l), esters (9 o), sulfones (9 n), and amines (9 i). The chemoselective activation of the C(sp 2 )À Cl over C(sp 2 )À F bond was demonstrated with the formation of product 9 m, which was formed in 46 % yield leaving the CÀ F bond untouched. To probe the synthetic utility of the protocol, the phosphorylation reaction was conducted on a 5 mmol gram scale leading to product 9 a in 63 % yield (680 mg isolated). The organocatalytic platform was also suitable for the borylation of aromatic chlorides using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B 2 pin 2 ), although a higher catalyst loading was needed (10 mol % of C1, Figure 4, bottom panel). Here, the use of acetonitrile as solvent minimized the competitive dechlorination reaction. Electron-rich and neutral substrates were effectively converted into the borylated products 10 a-10 f, while electron-poor aryl chlorides offered only low yields (p-CN and p-CO 2 Me substituents offered less than 20 % yield). The more challenging borylation of aryl fluorides was also possible, [12e] and products 10 a and 10 b were isolated in moderate yield.</p>
<p>Finally, we carried out further mechanistic investigations to confirm that catalyst C1 could activate the substrates via SET. Stern-Volmer studies revealed that all the model substrates quenched the emission of the excited anionic catalyst I* with the following relative rate: 4-chloroanisole 1 a &gt; chloro-N-boc-piperidine &gt; naphthalene &gt; 4-fluoroani-sole 2 a. Possible mechanisms for the described transformations are detailed in section E8 of the Supporting Information.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified a simple indole thiolate organocatalyst that becomes a strong reductant upon deprotonation and light excitation. This light-driven catalytic platform demonstrated a wide generality, since it could master the reductive activation of inert CÀ F, CÀ Cl and CÀ O bonds and the Birch-type reduction of unfunctionalized arenes. The mild conditions and the wide applicability suggest that this readily available organocatalyst could find widespread use for the photochemical activation of inert substrates.
