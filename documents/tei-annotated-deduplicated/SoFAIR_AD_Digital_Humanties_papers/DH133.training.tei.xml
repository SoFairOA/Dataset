<p>The Faces Revealed Project takes its lead from innovative research trends that see the combination of different but interconnected skills and competences. It aims at contributing to the study of ancient Egyptian coffins by developing a new and efficient methodology based on fast, simple, cost-effective, and portable technique allowing the acquisition of precise and accurate gemetric data. This technology will provide further insights into the manufacture, production, workshops, and possibly the ancient reuse of the Yellow Coffins and may also constribute to the creation of a new way of classifying these coffins.</p>
<p>The article summarizes the activities carried out in the first phase of the project 'Faces Revealed: Investigating the faces of Yellow Coffins through photogrammetry. Comparison between 3D model and digital twin for a new analysis of the manufacture, painting techniques and re-use'. The project -financed by the Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant N. 895130, Horizon 2020, European Union -started in April 2021 in collaboration with the Museo Egizio di Torino, the Department of Near Eastern Language and Culture, University of California, Los Angeles, and the Department of Architettura, Ingegneria delle Costruzioni e Ambiente Costruito, Politecnico di Milano. The project focuses on the study of Yellow Coffins, a specific class of artifacts that appeared in Thebes at the end of the New Kingdom and were used for more than a millennium, with a peak during the 21 st Dynasty (1069-645 BC) (Niwinski, 1988;Taylor, 1989). Their development has been extensively studied (Aston 2009;Niwiński, 1988;Sousa, 2018;Taylor 1989;van Walsem 1997) thanks to the coffins found in the 19 th century in two Thebans cachettes which are now stored in several museums around the world (Daressy, 1900;Sousa, 2017;Sousa et al., 2020). In the past, the scholars focused mainly on the study of layout, iconography, and texts of these objects (Niwiński, 1988;van Walsem, 1997). In the recent years the attention moved towards the production, materials, and painting techniques (Amenta, 2014;Amenta and Guichard, 2017;Dawson andStrudwick, 2016, 2018;Weiss, 2018), as well as the various techniques of execution and the widespread reuse of coffins during the 3 rd Intermediate Period (Cooney 2007(Cooney , 2011(Cooney , 2014(Cooney , 2017(Cooney , 2018a(Cooney , 2018b)). All these studies -including the Faces Revealed Project -are linked by a common task: investigates whether the construction and painting/decorative techniques can be also functional elements to create a typology (Amenta, 2014), against the background of a growing interest on the existence of ateliers and the reuse of objects. The innovative project focuses on two areas never considered before: the physiognomic traits of the coffin faces without the pictorial 'layer', and the impact and importance of the plaster for the ʻmodellingʼ and/or the 'remodeling' of the sculpted wooden masks.</p>
<p>Combining all the data (iconography, texts, layout, morphology and technical aspects) will allow us to isolate comparative models and outline a new, more precise classification of Yellow Coffins and their provenances in terms of workshop and production.</p>
<p>Facial features are important elements in understanding the typology and classification of statues. Details such as eyebrows, eye shape, cosmetic lines, ears allowed the scholars to group and date uninscribed statues or identify chronological internal changing in the style and statuary production (Bryan, 1987(Bryan, , 2010(Bryan, , 2015;;Hartwig, 2015;Laboury, 2010;Perdu, 2012;Sorouzian, 1999). These elements have rarely been considered in the analysis of Egyptian coffins. However, during the New Kingdom (1550-1069 BC) the anthropoid coffin was the predominant shape of coffin, and it was used throughout all the Egyptian history. The anthropoid shape of the coffin evoked a secondary body and as pointed out by Kathlyn Cooney, 'the depiction of the deceased's face, with open eyes, nose, and mouth carved from wood, was understood to be the means of access between the worlds of the living and the dead. The mummy's actual face would have been directly behind this ideal representation when the corpse was placed into the coffin, and the painting of facial features onto the coffin's surface allowed the dead to see, taste, and smell the living world' (Cooney, 2015). The faces are not only painted on anthropoid coffins, but they also representtogether with the hands -the only sculpted trait of these objects, worked separately and then applied to the main structure with the help of wooden tubular pegs. A further important element to be considered is the differencesometimes quite marked -between the geometrical and the painted facial figures, that is definitely worth being investigated. To this purpose, the photogrammetric approach proves to be costeffective, versatile, and useful since it offers an excellent record of the morphology of the surface allowing to digitally switch off the painted layer. We must consider that, differently from the statues, Yellow Coffins have a complex layering where one material interacts with the other (Weiss, 2018). During the 3 rd Intermediate Period (1069-6644 BC) the wood used for coffins was local: sycamore, tamarisk, and acacia woods (Asensi and Amorós, 2017). Differently from the cedar used in the years before, Egyptian wood was knotty and had to be pieced together from small scraps through different kind of joints and pegs (Nicholson and Shaw, 2000;Niwinski, 1988;Prestipino, 2017). To smooth out major irregularities of the wooden axes and joints, an overall layer of coarse paste was applied which generally does not lie on the carved wooden surface in a uniform manner. Often, we can find a large amount of plaster used to help create a curved surface and to give shape to the head, face and upper part of the trunk building up wigs and free-form body features such as ears and breasts (Weiss, 2018). Only after this process a thin layer of white plaster was applied for the painting. So, we must emphasize and underline that the 3D model reveals the surface level of the object that can correspond both to the plaster modelling or to the carved wood. If the face is covered by plaster, the photogrammetry cannot arrive on the level of the wood, this peculiarity is a prerogative of other technologies as X-Ray and CT-scan (Amenta, 2018), but it can give us the physical geometry of the object not always visible at the naked eye because concealed (visually, not physically) by the paint. For these reasons, photogrammetry is the most suitable technique to start an objective and in-depth morphometric analysis of faces on coffins. For the project was selected an amount of over one hundred Yellow Coffins dated from 19 th to the beginning of 22 nd Dynasty and spreads between Musée du Louvre, Paris; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Egyptian Museum, Cairo; Museo Archeologico, Florence; Museo Egizio, Turin; Museo Gregoriano Egizio, Musei Vaticani, Città del Vaticano; Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli; Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden. For each coffin the study includes:</p>
<p>• high-resolution photogrammetric survey in situ; • 3D photogrammetric data elaboration;</p>
<p>• autoptic comparison between textured 3D models and solid models to understand whether the pictorial layers correspond to the carving of the face; • identification of landmarks for measurements on the model without texture (morphometric approach to facial proportion, measurements and grouping); • database and data connection;</p>
<p>• new typology of Yellow Coffins.</p>
<p>From June 2021, 38 Yellow Coffins and 1 mask were examined (Museo Egizio di Torino, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, "Museo Egizio" di Firenze, Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, Musei Vaticani, Città del Vaticano). The project is focused on faces, but we enlarged the research on the external upper part of coffin lids until the lower part of the arms or, for the stola-coffins (van Walsem, 1997), until the end of the wesekhcollar.</p>
<p>The photogrammetric surveys were performed using a full-frame Nikon D750 camera coupled with a Nikkor 35 mm f/1.8 lens and a polarizer to avoid as much as possible reflections and shiny areas. The images were taken at the maximum resolution of 6016 pixels by 4016 pixels. The camera was places on a tripod and the shot was delayed of 5 second to prevent vibration during the acquisition. This also permitted to use low ISO value even in low illuminated museum rooms.</p>
<p>The mean calculated GSD of the photogrammetric survey is around 0,2 mm, since the pixel pitch is 6 μm and the distance of acquisition from the object was about 1 m. The acquisition geometry is circular around the object, maintaining the camera as much as possible nadiral to the coffin. The number of images for each artifact is variable considering a transversal overlap of the images of about 79-80%. A pre-calibrated L-shaped bar was places next to the head of the coffin and it was used with a twofold aim: to scale the reconstructed 3D model and to have a reference system useful to define a plane on which the orthophotos were projected (Mandelli et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The photogrammetric elaboration considered the use of Agisoft Metashape 1.7.5 and followed these steps: i) photo-alignment at high resolution; ii) automatic recognition and manual check of circular and cross non-coded targets; iii) scaling; iv) dense cloud reconstruction and data cleaning; v) mesh model; vi) texturing; vii) developing and exporting high-resolution orthophoto, textured and not textured (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Once the high-resolution 3D models and orthophotos were elaborated, the analyses of the faces were started. The aim is comparing the 3D models with and without colour and identify the most significative facial landmarks to be measured. For this reason, two different layers have been drawn with the help of various software packages:</p>
<p>• the first layer identifies facial landmarks on the physical geometry (modelled/sculpted traits: form of the face, nose, mouth, eyelids, eyebrows arch, ears -if present) seen from the top, right and left; • the second layer for the painted features to be drawn (eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips/mouth, chin, ears -if painted), seen from the same projections as before.</p>
<p>These separate layers, by means of CAD <rs xml:id="12973299" type="software" subtype="implicit">software</rs>, can be overlapped in transparency on the solid model, on the orthophoto and between them (Figure 2). This overlapping allows a precise inspection of their correspondence with fixed points. In this way it is possible to show any possible corrections of the paint applied to sculpted/modelled faces and/or whether they match or not. The comparison between physical geometry and visual appearance of the faces helped the principal investigator of the project to discern and reveal significant discrepancies. First observations showed that faces can be rounded or square, sometimes not symmetrical, or well proportioned; in some cases, the eyes are at different levels, the mouth is out of position regarding the central axis, which can create a distortion of the two halves of the face, or individual features are not placed in the correct relationship to each other.</p>
<p>In one case, the jaw seems to display prognathism; with all the specimens, the eyebrows follow the extension of the line of the nose that continues from the curve of the eyebrows: this curve, however, can be straight and slightly tilted at the ends, rounded or arched; the nose can be thin and proportionate, large at the base or very big; the mouth can be narrow and fleshy, or thin and straight (Figure 3). Starting from a simple autoptic observation of the form of the face, it is possible to arrange the finds into four groups:</p>
<p>i. round face (full cheeks; small, round chin; narrow, wide forehead); ii. square face (wide forehead; square, protruding jaw); iii. triangular face (high cheekbones; wide forehead; pointed chin); iv. oval face (wide forehead; shallower jaw; protruding chin).</p>
<p>One of the most important results was to certify how much the paint changes our perception of the object. When we digitally switch off the paint, the appearance of the face changes substantially and in different cases The coffin represents a male figure with braided (inner coffin and mummy board) or striped (outer coffin) tripartite wig with uncovered, sculpted, and naturalistic ears. All the surface is richly decorated, and the image repertoire combines typical New Kingdom elements with 3 rd Intermediate Period theological creations. On the base of the decoration, the coffins fall in 3 different typologies all dated to the beginning of the second half of the 21 st Dynasty (990-970 BC ca.) (Niwinski, 1988 and2004). The set is particularly interesting because we can find similar elements and others very different from each other (Figure 4). The faces on the inner coffin and mummy board are very similar both with paint and without. The underlay is well carved and rendered, both the faces are rounded (Type i) even if the inner coffin has gaunt cheeks differently from the mummy board ones. In both cases the eyes are small and symmetrical as well as well proportioned, the nose is straight and thin; the line of the nose is barely outlined and it does not continue in the eyebrows to create a complete arch; the mouths, unpainted, are narrow, smiling and with corners marked by two hollows. On the contrary the face on the outer coffin is oval (Type iv), the eyes are small but different in shape and at different levels (the left eye is higher than the right one); the nose is thin at the root and larger at the base, small and rounded ('button nose') and with visible nostrils; the line of the nose continues in the eyebrows which are, full rendered and arched; the mouth, outlined in red, is narrow but straight and without hollows at the corners. Nevertheless, these differences we can observe an important common element: the ears. The ears are big, long and with rounded lobes rendered in a naturalistic way in all 3 masks. Ears occupy the 2/3 of the face where the lower part of the lobe is in line with the base of the nasal septum and the upper part in line with the line of the headdress. At closer inspection of the geometry, the sculpted ears are bigger than the painted ones: the external part of the ears have been painted in blue, maybe to reduce their form (Figure 5). Why did the painter choose this solution? Is it maybe a trademark of a specific workshop? As the Italian critic art Giovanni Morelli's stated in 1892, 'incidental details of the way a particular artist portrays ears and hands, might be used to attribute unsigned paintings or sculptures to known artists' (Hartwig, 2015). Repeated patterns could correspond to habitual techniques that could be associated with a workshop or individual artist. For the moment the only linked data have been found on two stola coffins dated to the end of 21 st /early 22 nd Dynasty and stored in Leiden: the inner coffin of Djedmonthuiufankh (RMO, AMM 18-h) (Figure 1) and the mummy board of Penpi (RMO, Ah188). Another example of how the painting may alter the perception of the geometry is the coffin set of the Chantress of Amun, Ikhy (Musei Vaticani, inv. n. 2035.3.1-3) (Gasse, 1996;Niwiński, 1988;Prestipino, 2017). Dated to the late 21 st Dynasty the coffins were offered with by the Khedive of Egypt to Pope Leo XIII in 1894 after the discovery of Bab el-Gasus cache (Sousa et al., 2020). The principal investigator of the project observed that, by studying the painted faces of both artefacts, it is possible to recognize the same painting style and the same colours, which might be indicative of the same workshop or craftsman, or that they were painted at the same time. However, the uniformity in the painted features cannot be observed in the sculpted ones. The geometry of the face, in fact, immediately reveals that the face and physiognomic features of the mask on the mummy board are totally different from the face on the outer coffin (Figure 6).</p>
<p>The mummy board has a more square-shaped face with high cheekbones and a square chin; the nose is long, very large in the lower part, with flared nostrils; the mouth is closed, forming a hint of a smile with well-defined, large, fleshy lips. Conversely, the face of the outer coffin presents fine features with rounded cheekbones, chubby cheeks, and a slightly pointed chin; the nose is small and well-proportioned with ʻregularʼ nostrils, and the mouth, closed too, is linear and fleshy but less than those of the mummy board. Moreover, along with these so different facial features, we note that the mummy board presents a modification of some sculpted elements by means of the paint, possibly made to unify the style of decoration both in the mummy board and the outer coffin. This is evident in the mouth: the paint does not reflect the underlying features, but changes them, from a hint of a smile and a mouth with well-defined, large, fleshy lips to a smaller, closed, unsmiling mouth.</p>
<p>After the autoptic comparison via points and drawings, the next step of the project is the morphometric approach to facial proportions, measurements, and groupings. All the facial features are measured manually with
<rs xml:id="12973298" type="software">AutoCAD</rs> software, to understand the proportions of the faces. The orthophotos that are not textured allowed the identification of the main landmarks that are fundamental for proportions. Each face is inserted into a grid, which divides it into symmetrical portions (Cartwright and Svoboda, 2020). The main horizontal and vertical lines intersect at the point of the nose so that the face is divided into approximate quarters varying for the different faces. Vertical and horizontal distances represent the variables related to four of the major facial components: eyes, ears, nose, mouth (Figure 7). With the help of this division is possible measure and analyse:
</p>
<p>• the face size: as the distance between the midpoint of the hairline and the lowest point of the chin (A-C) or the distance between the endpoints of the left and right cheeks (D-E); • the eyes: as the distance between outer and inner corner of the eyes fissure (eR2-eR4, eL2-eL4); • the nose: the maximum height of the nose (near the forehead and eyebrows) until the base of the nasal septum (0-5); • the mouth/lip: as the distance between the base of the nasal septum and the midpoint of the oral fissure (5-β); • the ears: as the distance between the external point of the ears, in height and width (hR1-hR3; hR1-hR2) and their position.</p>
<p>In each pair of the 5 cases the position of the landmarks change from the coloured to the not coloured orthoimage. This confirms the extent to which the geometrical shape of the modelled piece of wood is always altered by the pictorial layer. This discrepancy might hint at a reuse -but of course this suggestion must always be validated by further analyses (Figure 10). It was noticed also that the results are influenced by the portion of the image analysed. To get better and plausible results the algorythm needs to be trained on large set of similar images. The will of the authors is to test the detector on the remaining coffins and extract the coordinates of the landmarks to evaluate the discrepancies between coloured and not colured orthoimages. These data included in the database could, or not, suggest clues for future studies.</p>
<p>After the facial features are measured, the faces will be grouped together on the basis of their similarities, and the variation of different facial components will be computed to understand if there are correlations that may indicate the recurrent presence of specific workshops or may contains clues pointing to a precise historical period. The entire corpus of the selected coffins will be managed in a relational database including all the acquired data, which will be organized into different tables. The last step will be processed in conjunction with the Vatican Coffin Project (VCP) and museums. For this step, the collaboration with the VCP is a unique opportunity to combine data acquired from the most recent and ongoing research on the Yellow Coffins in Europe. Such a collaboration will allow an integration of the data about new (traditional) studies on wood, decoration and paleography, for example, but also with results obtained through other scientific analyses as imaging techniques and analyses of different composition of pigments and materials which can reveal painter's work process, point to pigment origin and trade networks as well as CT-scans and X-rays which allow an easly identification of the density of the plaster. Combining the these data together will give us a wealth of technical information and will allow us to isolate comparative models and to outline a new more precise classification of the Yellow Coffins and their provenance, on the basis of all the constitutive elements of these finds.</p>
<p>Coffins are very complex objects both for their symbolic and religious value and as objects of art. They were subjected to changes during the time in terms of shape, decoration and style as well as to changes of traditions and customs. These complex objects can only be properly studied if we adopt a multidimensional approach, able to encompass as many of their aspects as possible.</p>
