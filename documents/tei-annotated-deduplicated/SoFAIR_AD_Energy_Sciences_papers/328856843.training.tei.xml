<p>A series of reduced graphene oxide-TiO 2 composites (rGO-TiO 2 ) were prepared by hydrothermal treatment using graphite and titanium isopropoxide as raw materials. The structural, surface, electronic, and optical properties of the prepared composites were extensively characterized by N 2 adsorption, FTIR, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and DRS. GO was found to be effectively reduced and TiO 2 to be in pure anatase phase in all composites obtained. Finally, experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these new materials as photocatalysts in the degradation of ethylparaben (EtP) by UV radiation. According to the band-gap energies obtained (ranging between 3.09 eV for 4% rGO-TiO 2 to 2.55 eV for 30% rGO-TiO 2 ), the rGO-TiO 2 composites behave as semiconductor materials. The photocatalytic activity is highest with a rGO content of 7 wt % (7% rGO-TiO 2 ), being higher than observed for pure TiO 2 (E g = 3.20 eV) and achieving 98.6% EtP degradation after only 40 min of treatment. However, the degradation yield decreases with higher percentages of rGO. Comparison with rGO-P25 composites showed that a better photocatalytic performance in EtP degradation is obtained with synthesized TiO 2 (rGO-TiO 2 ), probably due to the presence of the rutile phase (14.1 wt %) in commercial P25.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical and personal care products are extensively used worldwide and continuously released through wastewaters. These emerging pollutants cannot generally be removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes, and they have been found in treated waters and treatment plant sludge at low concentrations (ppb or ppm) [1].</p>
<p>Parabens are esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, with an alkyl or benzyl group, widely used as antimicrobial agents and preservatives in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food products [1]. The European Union has limited the concentration of parabens in cosmetic products to a maximum of 0.4% (p/p) for individual parabens and 0.8% (p/p), expressed as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, for paraben mixtures [2]. Although these composites are readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions, they can be considered as "pseudo-persistent" pollutants due to their high consumption and continuous release in the environment.</p>
<p>Parabens are endocrine disruptors, and their high estrogenicity has led to their implication in some cases of breast cancer [3] and male sterility [4]. Skin can also absorb parabens from cosmetic</p>
<p>Figure 1 depicts thermogravimetric analysis curves for TiO 2 and composite materials obtained in air atmosphere up to a temperature of 800 • C, showing four mass loss regions. The curves reveal an initial mass loss from 35 to 200 • C, corresponding to dehydration and related to the elimination of adsorbed water molecules from the surface; the second loss, between 200 and 325 • C, corresponds to the decomposition of labile oxygenated groups bound to GO sheets; the third loss, between 325 and 600 • C, corresponds to the combustion of carbon and more stable oxygenated groups [37,41]; and the fourth, between 600 and 800 • C, corresponds to the dehydroxylation process. The rGO (%) content of composites was calculated by subtracting the mass loss of TiO 2 alone from the mass loss of rGO-TiO 2 , obtaining 3.7% for 4% rGO-TiO 2 , 6.9% for 7% rGO-TiO 2 , 9.4% for 10% rGO-TiO 2 , and 28.3% for 30% rGO-TiO 2 . Figure S1 (in Supplementary Material) depicts the thermogravimetric analysis curves for P25 and x% rGO-P25 composites. The rGO content of the composites is 4.6% for 4% rGO-P25, 7.4% for 7% rGO-P25, 10.8% for 10% rGO-P25, and 28.1% for 30% rGO-P25.</p>
<p>Figure 2 depicts the diffractograms for graphite, GO, and rGO. Graphite shows a pronounced diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 26.56, corresponding to the (002) plane and indicating a high degree of crystallinity, with an interplanar distance of 0.336 nm (obtained by applying Bragg's law). Graphite peaks were identified using the JCPDS file n 75-1621. The GO diffractogram shows only two peaks, at 10.78 and 42.51. Differences with the graphite diffractogram indicate that the graphite structure was modified by oxidation. The peak at 26.56 (002) for graphite is shifted to 10.78 in the XRD for GO, this results from the incorporation of functional Figure S1 (in Supplementary Material) depicts the thermogravimetric analysis curves for P25 and x% rGO-P25 composites.

Graphite peaks were identified using the JCPDS file n 75-1621. The GO diffractogram shows only two peaks, at 10.78 and 42.51. Differences with the graphite diffractogram indicate that the graphite structure was modified by oxidation. The peak at 26.56 (002) for graphite is shifted to 10.78 in the XRD for GO, this results from the incorporation of functional in the XRD for GO, this results from the incorporation of functional groups containing oxygen (hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, and epoxide groups) [42] in basal graphite sheets, increasing interplanar separation [43,44]. Individual GO sheets are expected to be thicker than in the original graphene due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups bound to both sides of the sheets and the roughness at atomic scale that arises from structural defects (sp 3 bond) generated in the originally flat graphene sheets [45].</p>
<p>Application of the Bragg equation to the diffraction peak (001) for GO at 10.78 • yields a value of 0.820 nm, more than doubling the interplanar distance in comparison to the original graphite. The intense peak at 26.56 • , characteristic of graphite, is completely absent in the XRD for GO. A low intensity peak appears at 42.51 • , associated with plane (100) of the honeycomb hexagonal structure of graphite, also indicating the reaction effect. This peak (100) remains after oxidation and, alongside the disappearance of 002, indicates the loss of crystallinity through the generation of defects in the structure [46].</p>
<p>The rGO sample diffractogram shows a wide peak centered at 24.47 • , indicating a poor sheet ordering along the stacking direction [41]. This finding is related to the exfoliation and reduction of GO by the elimination of interspersed water and surface oxygenated groups. The interplanar distance is slightly larger in rGO (0.36 nm) than in graphite (0.34 nm), suggesting the presence of some residual surface oxygen groups in rGO. The band at 43.18 • corresponds to the turbostratic band of disordered carbon materials [47].</p>
<p>The interplanar distance, d 002 , of the sheets in these graphene materials is calculated by applying Bragg's law. The crystal size in direction c (D 002 ) of these materials is calculated by applying the Scherrer equation to the peak (002). Table 2 exhibits the values for the positions of diffraction peaks (2θ), full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, interplanar distance (d 002 ), and crystal size (D 002 ) for each material analyzed. The crystal size of graphite, with the lowest FWHM value, is substantially higher than that of GO or rGO. The size represents the approximate crystal width, which is related to the interplanar distance and allows the number of graphene sheets in the crystal to be calculated (N sheets = D 002 /d 002 ). Estimation of the number of sheets is much higher for graphite (n = 99.3) than for GO (n = 6.4) or rGO (n = 4.0). We observed no peaks of rGO in any rGO-TiO 2 samples (Figure 3), possibly due to their low percentages of rGO, so that they are masked by the diffraction signal for TiO 2 , and/or to destruction of the regular stack of GO through the intercalation of TiO 2 during sample preparation [38,39,41,43,44,48,49]. In comparison to GO (Figure 2), the complete disappearance of the peak at 10.78 • in all composites suggests the successful conversion of GO to rGO in the final composites [39,50].

<p>The peak at 25.2° is slightly wider in composites than in TiO2, suggesting that the reticular structure of TiO2 is distorted by interaction with GO. The mean crystal size, calculated using the Scherrer equation for composites, is within the range of 19.7-17.6 nm, smaller than the size for TiO2 (Table 3). The smallest size is for the 7% rGO-TiO2 composite.</p>
<p>Figure S2 (Supplementary Material) depicts X-ray diffractograms of P25 nanoparticles and of rGO-P25 composite materials with different percentages of rGO. Table S1 lists some of the characteristics of these materials according to their diffractograms. Peaks at 2θ = 25.26° and 48.01° confirm the anatase structure. The diffractogram shows a peak at 2θ = 27.39°, assigned to rutile (JCPDS n 88-1175) [49]. The anatase and rutile content of P25 was calculated using Equation:</p>
<p>where XA is the fraction in anatase weight of the mixture, and IA and IR are the intensities of the diffraction peaks of anatase (101) and rutile (110) [51]. The XRD data indicate that the anatase:rutile ratio is 86:14. The crystal size is 20.6 nm for anatase and 19.3 nm for rutile. In composites with P25, the crystal size is changed by the presence of rGO (Table S1) [52]. The TiO2 sample prepared for this study contains 100% anatase. The anatase crystal size is larger in P25 (20.6 nm), the sample containing rutile, than in the TiO2 sample (19.9 nm).</p>

<p>Infrared spectroscopy provides information on chemical composites and their structures through the molecular vibrations associated with each band. Figure 4 depicts the FTIR spectra for GO and rGO. Graphite shows no significant peaks (spectrum not shown). GO shows numerous peaks or bands of oxygenated groups [42].</p>
<p>There is a wide band at 3420 cm -1 , corresponding to stretching vibrations of the -OH bond in C-OH groups, with possible contributions from carboxylic acids and water [25,[53][54][55][56]. The small peaks at 2918 and 2846 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of CH 2 . The peak at 1715 cm corresponds to the stretching of carbonyl/carboxyl groups (C=O) of the carboxylic functionalities (-COOH) presumably located at the sheet edges [25,53,[55][56][57][58]. The peak at 1625 cm -1 is related to stretching in the sp 2 vibration plane of C=C bond [55,56]. The peak at 1372 cm -1 corresponds to bending vibrations of C-OH hydroxyl groups [25,53,57], and the peak at 1220 cm -1 to bending vibrations of epoxy groups (C-O-C) [25,53,56,57]. The peak at 1030 cm -1 corresponds to the C-O vibration of epoxy, ether, or peroxide groups [53,57]. The results obtained for GO by this technique are highly useful and complement XPS results, because it detects the presence/absence of epoxy groups, which are not differentiated from carbonyls with XPS. All the above peaks are characteristic of GO; however, in the case of rGO, the peaks at 1715, 1372, and 1030 cm -1 (attributed to vibrations of COOH, C-OH, and C-O groups, respectively) decrease in intensity due to the decomposition of these groups during hydrothermal treatment.</p>

Figure 5 displays the IR spectra of rGO-TiO2 composites. In TiO2, the strong and wide band at 3400 cm -1 corresponds to stretching vibration of hydrogen bound to surface water molecules and hydroxyl groups. This is confirmed by the presence of a peak at 1625 cm -1 caused by bending vibration of coordinated water and Ti-OH groups [57,59]. This peak is also assigned to vibration of the aromatic ring in the GO structure within the composites. The reduced intensity of the peak in the composites at 1720 cm -1 suggests that they largely contain hydroxyl groups rather than ketone or carboxylic groups [58]. The reduction in the peak at 1030 cm -1 corresponds to oxygenated functional groups such as C-O [42]. Figure 5 displays the IR spectra of rGO-TiO 2 composites.

<p>The spectra of TiO 2 and composites show peaks at 650 and 519 cm -1 , attributed to vibration of Ti-O-Ti bonds in TiO 2 [25,42,57,59]. Generally, broadbands or peaks below 1000 cm -1 in composites indicate a combination of Ti-O-Ti and Ti-O-C vibrations due to the chemical interaction of TiO 2 with rGO [54]. The presence of Ti-O-C bonds indicates that GO, with residual carboxyl groups, strongly interacts with the surface hydroxyl groups of TiO 2 nanoparticles and forms chemical bonds in the composites during hydrothermal treatment. The spectra of TiO2 and composites show peaks at 650 and 519 cm -1 , attributed to vibration of Ti-O-Ti bonds in TiO2 [25,42,57,59].

<p>The absorption peaks of oxygenated functional groups such as C=O (1717 cm -1 ), -OH (1170 cm -1 ), and C-O-C (1035 cm -1 ) drastically decrease or even disappear in composites, indicating that TiO2 preferentially binds to rGO at these sites [25,42,[55][56][57]60].</p>
<p>Figure S3 depicts the IR spectra of rGO-P25 composites, showing a reduced intensity of the peaks for surface groups present in rGO (Figure 4) due to the formation of bonds between P25 and rGO. Sample P25 has a wide peak at 3400 cm -1 and another at 1630 cm -1 , corresponding to OH groups, and a wide band below 900 cm -1 , attributed to the vibration of Ti-O-Ti bonds.</p>
<p>Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and non-destructive technique for characterizing the electronic and structural properties of carbon materials. In graphitic materials, the G band, at ~1575 cm -1 , represents the perfect graphitic structure of carbon atom bonds with sp 2 hybridization and is assigned to E2g-symmetry phonons of carbon atoms with sp 2 hybridization [58]. The D band, at 1354 cm -1 , is assigned to the K point of A1g-symmetry phonons and attributed to the presence of defects or disordered carbon. The G' or 2D band, at 2700 cm -1 , is assigned to the first overtone of band D. This band is not caused by defects, given that it is observed in defect-free graphitic crystals [61], but rather by other characteristics of graphitic materials. The material is highly crystalline when this band is well defined and narrow. The presence of this well-defined sign further indicates the degree of graphitization of the material. Its loss of intensity and widening are associated with increased structural disorder [61].</p>
<p>Figure 6 and Table 4 exhibit the Raman spectra of graphite, GO, and rGO, and the parameters obtained from their analysis. The Raman spectrum of graphite shows a highly ordered structure (high crystallinity), with well-defined peaks at 1354 cm -1 (D), 1582 cm -1 (G), and 2714 cm -1 (2D), indicating a stacked lamina structure. The absorption peaks of oxygenated functional groups such as C=O (1717 cm -1 ), -OH (1170 cm -1 ), and C-O-C (1035 cm -1 ) drastically decrease or even disappear in composites, indicating that TiO 2 preferentially binds to rGO at these sites [25,42,[55][56][57]60].</p>

The Raman spectrum of graphite shows a highly ordered structure (high crystallinity), with well-defined peaks at 1354 cm -1 (D), 1582 cm -1 (G), and 2714 cm -1 (2D), indicating a stacked lamina structure. After oxidation treatment, the Raman spectrum of graphite evidence structure modification, observing bands at 1359 cm -1 (D), 1600 cm -1 (G), 2715 cm -1 (2D), 2942 cm -1 (D+D'), and 3156 cm -1 (D'). The widths of D and G peaks are substantially greater than in the original graphite, indicating a lower signal and therefore lower crystallinity. In the Raman spectrum of GO, the G band is wider and shifted to higher frequencies in comparison to graphite (1582 cm -1 ), while a substantial increase in the D band is observed. These changes in the width and intensity of D and G peaks indicate an increase in the disorder of the graphitic sheets that form the original material. This disorder derives from the creation of defects through the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups in the basal layer or through a larger increase in the proportion of oxygenated margins [62]. The increase in the D band can be produced by: (i) an increase in the amount of disordered carbon atoms in GO, corresponding to sp 3 domains; or (ii) a significant reduction in the size of sp 2 domains in the layer through ultrasonic oxidation and exfoliation. This suggests the coexistence of sp 2 and sp 3 hybridization; i.e., GO contains crystalline and amorphous forms of carbon [63]. The presence of the D peak is mainly due to a chemical functionalization that affects numerous sp 3 carbon atoms in GOs, but it is attributable to defects in carbon structures in rGOs and varies according to the density of defects and the distance between them. The removal of surface functional groups by the reduction process produces vacancies and the reorganization of atoms in the carbon structure (rings with five or seven members), among other defects.</p>

<p>The ratio of D band to G band intensities (I D /I G ) gives the proportion of amorphous and disordered carbon (sp 3 ) with respect to graphitic carbon (sp 2 ), allowing comparison of the structural order among the samples. In this way, the I D /I G ratio is 0.13 for graphite, 0.79 for GO, and 0.89 for rGO. The higher I D /I G in GO results from the greater disorder of this structure, due to oxygenated functional groups produced during oxygenation of the graphite. The oxidation process endows the graphite layers and their fragmentation with a certain amorphous character. The ends of the fragments act as defects, thereby increasing the intensity of band D. These results are in agreement with previous reports [38,45]. The higher I D /I G ratio for rGO than for GO suggests a reduction in the mean size of sp 2 domains after the reduction of exfoliated GO due to the elimination of oxygenated functional groups by the hydrothermal treatment. It is reasonable to consider that GO reduction causes fragmentation throughout reactive sites, producing new graphitic domains as well as large amounts of edges that act as defects, increasing the D peak [45].</p>
<p>The ratio between intensities is also frequently used to determine the crystal size parallel to basal planes, L a , using the equation of Tuinstra and Koenig (Equation ( 2)) [63][64][65]:</p>
<p>where λ l is the laser excitation wavelength (514.5 nm).</p>
<p>L a values are 134 nm for graphite, 21.2 nm for GO, and 18.8 nm for rGO (Table 4), within the range described in the literature [66]. A higher L a value indicates an increased sp 2 domain in the carbonous network.</p>
<p>Figure 7 and Table 5 display the Raman spectra of the synthetized composites and the parameters obtained from them. Differences are observed between rGO composites and GO (Table 4), including a systematic variation in the position/intensity of D and 2D bands, indicating its reduction. In general, their position shifts to lower wavelengths (13.7 for D band and 35.3 cm -1 for 2D band) and their intensity increases. These variations in D and 2D bands in the composites can largely be attributed to the anchoring of TiO 2 nanoparticles, which act as defects on the surface of rGO sheets and preserve their structural integrity after the deposition of TiO 2 . Therefore, the presence of these two peaks suggests that the structure of rGO persists within the composite [48]. In addition, the I D /I G ratios in the composites (0.95-0.98) are higher than in the rGO sample (0.89), suggesting a structural disorder related to a strong interaction between TiO 2 nanoparticles and rGO sheets after reduction during hydrothermal treatment [48].

The higher ID/IG in GO results from the greater disorder of this structure, due to oxygenated functional groups produced during oxygenation of the graphite. The oxidation process endows the graphite layers and their fragmentation with a certain amorphous character. The ends of the fragments act as defects, thereby increasing the intensity of band D. These results are in agreement with previous reports [38,45]. The higher ID/IG ratio for rGO than for GO suggests a reduction in the mean size of sp 2 domains after the reduction of exfoliated GO due to the elimination of oxygenated functional groups by the hydrothermal treatment. It is reasonable to consider that GO reduction causes fragmentation throughout reactive sites, producing new graphitic domains as well as large amounts of edges that act as defects, increasing the D peak [45].</p>
<p>The ratio between intensities is also frequently used to determine the crystal size parallel to basal planes, La, using the equation of Tuinstra and Koenig (Equation ( 2)) [63][64][65]:</p>
<p>where l is the laser excitation wavelength (514.5 nm). La values are 134 nm for graphite, 21.2 nm for GO, and 18.8 nm for rGO (Table 4), within the range described in the literature [66]. A higher La value indicates an increased sp 2 domain in the carbonous network.</p>
<p>Figure 7 and Table 5 display the Raman spectra of the synthetized composites and the parameters obtained from them. Differences are observed between rGO composites and GO (Table 4), including a systematic variation in the position/intensity of D and 2D bands, indicating its reduction. In general, their position shifts to lower wavelengths (13.7 for D band and 35.3 cm -1 for 2D band) and their intensity increases. These variations in D and 2D bands in the composites can largely be attributed to the anchoring of TiO2 nanoparticles, which act as defects on the surface of rGO sheets and preserve their structural integrity after the deposition of TiO2. Therefore, the presence of these two peaks suggests that the structure of rGO persists within the composite [48]. In addition, the ID/IG ratios in the composites (0.95-0.98) are higher than in the rGO sample (0.89), suggesting a structural disorder related to a strong interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and rGO sheets after reduction during hydrothermal treatment [48]. It can therefore be concluded that the composites are formed by graphene nanosheets coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The increase in I D /I G ratio intensities from GO, rGO, to rGO-TiO 2 indicates a decrease in the mean number of sp 2 domains formed during the hydrothermal reaction. The increased I D /I G ratio in composite spectra also confirms the formation of rGO-TiO 2 composites by the hydrothermal treatment [39,67,68]. The I D /I G ratio is 20-24% higher in the composites than in GO, and the smallest increase is in the 7% rGO-TiO 2 sample. TiO 2 nanoparticles were identified in all composites by the appearance of bands at lower frequencies (100-700 cm -1 ). Raman active modes, A 1g +2B 1g +3E g , are detected at 146 cm -1 (E g ), 197 cm -1 (E g ), 397 cm -1 (B 1g ), 517 cm -1 (A 1g ), and 638 cm -1 (E g ), indicating the presence of the anatase phase in all samples [50,69]. No peaks are observed corresponding to the rutile-to-brookite phase, in agreement with the XRD results [48].</p>
<p>The peaks at 144, 197, and 639 cm -1 correspond to the E g mode of the symmetric valence vibration of the O-Ti bond; while the signal at 396 cm -1 corresponds to the B 1g mode of the symmetric bending vibration O-Ti-O and the signal at 517 cm -1 to the A 1g mode of the asymmetric vibration of the O-Ti bond [70].</p>
<p>In the composites, the band at 146 cm -1 shifts to a higher wavelength, from 146 to 153 cm -1 , and widens (FHWM rises from 15 to 25 cm -1 ) through the interaction of TiO 2 metallic ions with GO sheets [50,71] and can be attributed to the formation of Ti-O-C on the surface of composites.</p>
<p>Figure S4 and Table S2 exhibit the Raman spectra of rGO-P25 composites and the parameters obtained. The presence of bands at frequencies below 700 cm -1 indicates the presence of P25 nanoparticles. The I D /I G ratio is similar to that for rGO, and La values are higher than in rGO-TiO 2 composites (Table 5).</p>
<p>GO-based samples were characterized by XPS to identify functional groups. Figure 8 depicts the XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s regions of GO and rGO samples. Table 6 lists the bond energies (BE) values, C/O ratios, and percentages of the corresponding deconvoluted peaks of C and O.</p>
<p>The C 1s spectrum of GO deconvolutes into four peaks corresponding to four types of carbon bond. BE at 284.6 eV is attributed to C=C sp 2 bonds and BE at 285.5 eV to C-C sp 3 bonds. BE at 286.5 is assigned to C-O bonds, including epoxy and hydroxyl groups, and the peak at 288.5 eV is attributed to C=O, corresponding to carbonyl and carboxyl groups [72]. The oxygen content of the GO sample is 23.3%, with a C/O ratio of 3.3, similar to previously reported values [72,73]. The main oxygenated species correspond to epoxy and hydroxyl groups in basal layers (13.8%) versus carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the edges (8.1%), as observed in Table 6.</p>
<p>The spectrum of O 1s of GO deconvolutes into four peaks at BEs of 531.2, 532.5, 533.7, and 534.4 eV, corresponding to C=O bonds in carbonyl or carboxyl groups, C-Oa bonds in alcohol, ether and epoxy groups, C-Ob bonds in carboxyl and ester groups, and peroxyacid or peroxyester groups, respectively.</p>
<p>Oxygenated species decrease in the rGO sample, as observed in the species percentages in C 1s (Table 6). The percentage of hydroxyl and epoxy groups (286.6 eV) is 42% lower than in the GO sample. C=O groups at 288.4 eV is also decreased, but by a lower percentage. These findings indicate that oxygenated groups on the edges are less easily removed during reduction than are those on basal layers. Reduction increases the percentage of C=C bonds (284.6 eV), indicating the restoration of the graphitic structure after the reduction process [72,74]. The spectrum of O 1s of GO deconvolutes into four peaks at BEs of 531.2, 532.5, 533.7, and 534.4 eV, corresponding to C=O bonds in carbonyl or carboxyl groups, C-Oa bonds in alcohol, ether and epoxy groups, C-Ob bonds in carboxyl and ester groups, and peroxyacid or peroxyester groups, respectively. Oxygenated species decrease in the rGO sample, as observed in the species percentages in C 1s (Table 6). The percentage of hydroxyl and epoxy groups (286.6 eV) is 42% lower than in the GO sample. C=O groups at 288.4 eV is also decreased, but by a lower percentage. These findings indicate that oxygenated groups on the edges are less easily removed during reduction than are those on basal layers. Reduction increases the percentage of C=C bonds (284.6 eV), indicating the restoration of the graphitic structure after the reduction process [72,74].</p>
<p>This greater decrease at 532.6 eV, C-Oa, in hydroxyl and epoxy groups versus carbonyl and carboxyl groups is also observed in the XPS spectra of O 1s (Figure 8). Removal of oxygenated groups This greater decrease at 532.6 eV, C-Oa, in hydroxyl and epoxy groups versus carbonyl and carboxyl groups is also observed in the XPS spectra of O 1s (Figure 8). Removal of oxygenated groups by the reduction process is also observed in the comparison of atomic percentages of O between GO and rGO samples, which are 23.3% and 13.3%, respectively.</p>
<p>Figure 9 depicts the XPS spectra of C 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p regions of rGO/TiO 2 composite materials and Table 7 exhibits the bond, assignation, and quantification energies of the peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p regions in these samples.</p>
<p>Figure S5 and Table S3 of Supplementary Material show the results obtained for rGO/P25 composite materials.</p>
<p>The Ti 2p spectrum of composite materials shows two centered peaks at 458.1 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 1/2 , and 463.8 eV, assigned to Ti 2p 3/2 , with a separation energy of 5.7 eV, consistent with the BE values of Ti 4+ in pure anatase [75]. The C 1s spectrum deconvolutes into four peaks, corresponding to C=C, C-C, C-O, and C=O bonds and BEs of 284.4, 285.4, 286.3, and 288.0 eV, respectively. Comparison between the composite materials and GO (Table 6) reveals an increased percentage of C=C and a reduced percentage of oxygenated groups. This may be due to the nucleation and growth of TiO 2 nanoparticles in GO sheets, where C-O groups are consumed and partially reduced to C=C [76].</p>
<p>The partial reduction of GO is confirmed by calculating the ratio of peak areas for oxidized carbon to peak areas for completely reduced carbon atoms, AC-O/AC-C. Thus, the AC-O/AC-C ratio is lower in all rGO/TiO 2 composite materials than in the original GO, being 0.28 for the GO sample, 0.17 for rGO, 0.18 for 4% rGO/TiO 2 , 0.19 for 7% rGO/TiO 2 , 0.21 for 10% rGO/TiO 2 , and 0.23 for 30% rGO/TiO 2 (Table 7).</p>
<p>The XPS spectrum of deconvoluted O 1s shows three peaks at BEs of 529.3, 530.3, and 531.3 eV, corresponding to O 2-in the TiO 2 network, OH -adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 , and C-O groups, respectively [76].</p>
<p>The Ti/C ratio is 0.75 for catalyst 4% rGO-TiO 2 , 0.77 for 7% rGO-TiO 2 , 0.72 for 10% rGO-TiO 2 , and 0.41 for 30% rGO-TiO 2 (Table 7). The Ti/C ratio is slightly higher in 7% rGO/TiO 2 than in the other samples, suggesting that TiO 2 nanoparticles permit superior dispersion of rGO sheets in the TiO 2 matrix.

<p>Photoluminescence is frequently used to examine the surface structure and excited status of semiconductors, as well as to analyze the recombination of their electron-hole pairs [21]. Figure 11 depicts the photoluminescence spectra of TiO 2 and composite materials with different rGO percentages. The luminescence efficiency of the rGO-TiO 2 composites is much lower than that of the bare TiO 2 , indicating the depressed recombination of the electron-hole pairs in the composites [21] due to electron transfer from excited TiO 2 to rGO, hampering electron recombination [39,60]. The PL peak at 364 nm (Figure 11) is attributed to the band-to-band recombination. The band at 400-450 nm is attributed to the excitonic PL peaks trapped by surface states and defects, and the peak at 460 nm is induced by indirect recombination via oxygen defects [79]. Figure S6 in Supplementary Material shows the energy level diagram of TiO2 and rGO. The TiO2 conduction band is -4.2 eV and the valence band is -7.4 eV, while rGO has a conduction band of -4.4 eV. These levels allow photoinduced electrons to transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to rGO, which can efficiently separate photoinduced electrons and, as indicated above, prevent recombination of charge carriers in photocatalytic processes.</p>

<p>Before performing the photodegradation experiments, paraben adsorption experiments were conducted on the composites under study to eliminate the contribution of adsorption to the overall EtP removal process. In addition, the effect of direct photolysis on EtP removal was studied by using UV radiation alone, which achieves 61.5% degradation after 40 min irradiation with 14.0% TOC removal (Table 8). As observed in Table 8, the presence of TiO 2 in the medium increases EtP photodegradation in comparison to direct photolysis. The percentage of rGO in the composite has a major effect on the photocatalytic performance. Based on the photodegradation rate, greater catalytic activity is observed for 7% rGO-TiO 2 , 4% rGO/TiO 2 , and 10% rGO-TiO 2 composites than for TiO 2 alone. The time to degrade 90% EtP decreases with the use of rGO-TiO 2 composites, and is shortest (23.9 min) when the 7% rGO-TiO 2 sample is used. According to the results in Table 8, the performance of EtP photocatalytic degradation decreases in the order: 7% rGO-TiO 2 &gt; 4% rGO-TiO 2 &gt; 10% rGO-TiO 2 &gt; TiO 2 &gt; 30% rGO-TiO 2 &gt; UV. At 40 min, the percentage degradation of EtP is always higher than the percentage removal of TOC, indicating that not all degraded EtP is mineralized during the catalytic degradation process, obtaining by-products with a lower molecular weight than that of EtP.</p>
<p>The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of rGO in the TiO 2 composite considerably enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 , increasing the degradation rate constant from 0.031 to 0.096 min -1 in the presence of 7% rGO. The percentage degradation of EtP at 40 min is 72.5% for TiO 2 and rises to 98.6% for 7% rGO-TiO 2 . These results evidence the positive role of rGO in EtP photodegradation. The presence of rGO sheets in the TiO 2 composite favors its photocatalytic activity in the following four ways: (i) rGO sheets improve the adsorption capacity of the rGO/TiO 2 composite by increasing its surface area (Table 1), thereby increasing the concentration of EtP molecules close to the active sites in TiO 2 and thereby improving photodegradation; (ii) graphene is an electron acceptor due to its two-dimension π conjugation structure, and the excited electrons of TiO 2 can rapidly transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to rGO in rGO/TiO 2 composites, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and enhancing EtP degradation; (iii) rGO can act as a sensitizer by donating electrons to TiO 2 . These electrons are excited by UV radiation photon, generating superoxide radicals through reduction of the adsorbed molecular oxygen; in addition, positively charged rGO sheets attract TiO 2 electrons and create positive holes in the valence band of TiO 2 , which react with the water adsorbed to generate hydroxyl radicals; and (iv) the presence of C-O-Ti bonds in composites reduces the band-gap energy to a value of 2.55 eV, as reported in Section 2.7, facilitating the transition of electrons from the valence to the conduction band and increasing the concentration of radicals generated [38,80].</p>
<p>The results in Table 8 demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of composite materials depends on their rGO content. Thus, the activity increases when the rGO rises from 4 to 7% and decreases when it rises to 10%, and this decrease is much higher when the sample contains 30% rGO, with the photoactivity being lower for 30% rGO-TiO 2 than for TiO 2 . The mass ratio of rGO to TiO 2 affects the photodegradation process performance because both materials have a synergic effect on pollutant adsorption and photocatalysis. Depending on the type of composite, there is an optimal rGO/TiO 2 ratio that achieves maximum pollutant degradation due to the uniformity of titanium dioxide anchoring. When this optimal rGO amount is exceeded, the performance of the process decreases, because an excess of rGO particles can cover the active sites on the TiO 2 surface or act as recombination centers. This favors the aggregation of rGO-TiO 2 composites, blocking light to the TiO 2 surface and restricting the rGO-TiO 2 contact, thereby reducing the synergic effect [31,60,80].</p>
<p>The above findings indicate that the optimal rGO percentage in TiO 2 composites is around 7% in the present system. Comparison of characteristics of the four composite samples under study shows that 7% rGO-TiO 2 has the smallest crystal size, 17.6 nm (Table 3), and the lowest I D /I G ratio, 0.95 (Table 5). These two characteristics favor the behavior of 7% rGO-TiO 2 , because a smaller crystal size increases the number of active sites exposed to light and a lower I D /I G value indicates a higher proportion of carbon atoms with sp 2 hybridization, favoring the electronic conductivity of the sample and, therefore, its photoactivity.</p>
<p>With respect to the behavior of rGO-P25 composite materials, Figure S7 depicts the degradation kinetics of EtP, and Table 9 lists the values of kinetic parameters obtained. The photocatalytic activity of P25 (Table 9) is lower than that of the TiO 2 prepared in this study (Table 8), and rGO-P25 composite materials are much less active in EtP photodegradation compared with rGO-TiO 2 .</p>
<p>Numerous authors have studied the reference material P25 (manufactured by Degussa but now by Evonik Industries), a mixed-phase TiO 2 photocatalyst (85.9 wt % anatase and 14.1 wt % rutile), for comparison with the materials synthetized in each laboratory [81,82]. The P25 sample is a heterojunction photocatalyst of TiO 2 . Although anatase is commonly considered the most active phase of TiO 2 in photocatalysis, it has been demonstrated that the binding of two phases (anatase with brookite or anatase with rutile) improves the photocatalytic activity in comparison to anatase alone. This improvement is attributable to its effect on the separation of charge carriers, because it traps electrons in rutile phase and minimizes electron recombination. This is similar to the heterojunction between different photocatalysts [83][84][85]. All of the present results indicate that the TiO 2 prepared for this study is a more active photocatalyst for degrading EtP in comparison to commercial P25; this may be due in part to the larger surface area (Table 1) and smaller crystal size (Tables 3 and4) of TiO 2 than of P25. These differences also make rGO-TiO 2 composites more photoactive than the corresponding rGO-P25 composites. Table S4 summarizes the most significant results reported from the literature when using other photocatalysts and UV or solar radiation for the removal of parabens from water. It can be concluded that 7% rGO-TiO 2 photocatalyst is the most active in EtP photodegradation.</p>
<p>All chemical reagents used in this study (natural graphite, potassium permanganate, sodium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide [33%], sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, ethanol, titanium isopropoxide, ethylparaben, and triethanolamine) were high-purity analytical grade reagents and were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Titanium(IV) oxide (Aeroxide P25) was purchased from Acros Organics. All solutions were prepared using ultrapure water obtained with Milli-Q equipment (18.2 MΩ cm).</p>
<p>GO preparation was based on the modified Hummers method [37,53]. Briefly, 120 mL H 2 SO 4 conc, 2.5 g graphite, and 2.5 g NaNO 3 were added in a beaker under agitation and in a cold bath. Subsequently, 15 g KMnO 4 was added very slowly in small doses at &lt; 20 • C. The suspension was continuously agitated for 2 h at 35 • C. Next, 325 mL of water was added to the cold mixture, raising the temperature to 90 • C; 8.83 mL H 2 O 2 33% was then added to reduce KMnO 4 to soluble manganese ions, maintaining the agitation for 30 min. The oxidized material was washed with 10% HCl and the suspension was centrifuged and washed several times with water until reaching neutral pH. The resulting product was oven-dried at 60 • C for 24 h to obtain graphite oxide, which was dispersed in 250 mL water and sonicated for 1 h. The sonicated dispersion was centrifuged for 30 min at 8000 rpm to separate the non-exfoliable graphite oxide particles from the GO particles remaining in the solution.</p>
<p>rGO-TiO 2 composites were prepared using a hydrothermal method [41]. Briefly, 3.7 mL titanium isopropoxide was added to 3.3 mL triethanolamine in a 25 mL volumetric flask in order to obtain a 0.5 M Ti(IV) solution. The rGO-TiO 2 composites were obtained by adding different amounts of a GO dispersion (1 mg/mL) to 42.9 mL of a water:ethanol (1:14) mixture under continuous agitation. Subsequently, 8.6 mL of the 0.5 M Ti(IV) solution was added, agitating for 24 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution, which was then placed in a 120 mL Teflon vessel within a stainless steel reactor (Parr Acid Digestion Vessel, Model 4748) and heated at 180 • C for 24 h. The resulting solid was washed three times with ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and then oven-dried at 60 • C.</p>
<p>The composite materials obtained were designated xrGO-TiO 2 , with x being the GO content (4%, 7%, 10%, or 30%). Pure samples of TiO 2 samples (without GO addition) and rGO were also prepared using the same experimental method (without titanium isopropoxide).</p>
<p>rGO-P25 composites were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method [86]. Briefly, different amounts of GO were added to a mixture of water (60 mL) and ethanol (30 mL) and sonicated for 30 min.

This mixture was placed in a 120 mL Teflon vessel within a stainless-steel reactor (Parr Acid Digestion Vessel, Model 4748) and heated at 120 • C for 3 h to simultaneously achieve GO reduction and P25 deposition on rGO sheets. Finally, the resulting composite material was recovered by filtration, washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 70 • C for 12 h.</p>
<p>Samples were texturally characterized by N 2 adsorption at -196 • C with ASAP 2020 equipment (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). The BET surface area (S BET ) was calculated according to the adsorption isotherms. Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) and Stoeckli equations were applied to determine micropore volume (V 0 ) and mean micropore width (L 0 ). The mesopore volume was obtained as the difference in the amount of N 2 adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.95 and V 0 .</p>

They were performed in a UV laboratory reactor system 2 (UV Consulting Peschl, Mainz, Germany) equipped with medium-pressure mercury vapor lamp (TQ 150, nominal power 150 W), pouring 700 mL of EtP solution (0.3 mM) with 0.7 g/L of rGO-TiO 2 into the reactor. EtP concentrations were determined at different time points using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (Thermo-Fisher) equipped with a UV800 photodiode detector (column: Hypersil GOLD 25 × 4.6 mm; mobile phase: 50:50 methanol: acidic water [0.01% HCOOH]; flow rate: 1 mL/min, injection volume: 20 µL; UV detector wavelength: 254 nm). For each experiment, the photoreactor was activated after stabilizing the lamp and controlling the temperature (25 • C), and 2 mL aliquots were then withdrawn from the reactor at different time points to measure concentrations of EtP and total organic carbon (TOC). EtP mineralization was followed by TOC measurements, as described elsewhere [87].</p>
<p>rGO-TiO 2 composites with different percentages of rGO were successfully prepared using a simple hydrothermal method. The results obtained demonstrated the effective reduction of GO, the formation of pure anatase phase, and the formation of Ti-O-C bonds on composite surfaces. The surface area and porosity are more developed in the rGO-TiO 2 composites than in the GO-P25 composites. The highest Ti/C ratio is observed for the 7% rGO-TiO 2 composite, due to a superior rGO sheets dispersion in the TiO 2 matrix. All rGO-TiO 2 composites obtained behave as semiconductor materials (Eg ≤ 3.1 eV), and a higher percentage of rGO produces a reduction in band gap energies due to the formation of Ti-O-C bonds.</p>
<p>The highest photocatalytic activity for EtP degradation under UV radiation is achieved with the composite containing 7% rGO (7%rGO-TiO 2 ), which reaches 98.6% degradation after 40 min of irradiation. However, a higher graphene content leads to the aggregation of graphene nanosheets and TiO 2 nanoparticles, reducing the light absorption capacity and EtP photodegradation.</p>
<p>The presence of two phases (anatase and rutile) in P25, and the smaller surface area and larger crystal size in rGO-P25 versus rGO-TiO 2 composites may be responsible for the lower photocatalytic activity of the former in EtP removal. In the rGO-P25 composites, photocatalytic EtP degradation reaches the maximum value with a rGO content of only 4%.</p>
<p>Finally, it can be concluded that this type of photoactive composites, based on rGO and TiO 2 and with an adequate content of rGO, can be highly effective for the UV photodegradation of emerging organic pollutants such as parabens in water.
