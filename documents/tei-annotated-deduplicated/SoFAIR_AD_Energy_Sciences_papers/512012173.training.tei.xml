<p>Despite renewed efforts to combat climate change, it remains uncertain how economies will achieve emission reduction by 2050. Among different decarbonisation strategies, knowledge about the potential role and contributions of social movements to curbing carbon emissions has been limited. This study aims to shed light on the diverse contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget, as well as on the specific outcomes and strategies employed in protests against hydrocarbon activities. For this purpose, we conduct a systematic literature review of 57 empirical cases of social movements contesting fossil fuel projects in 29 countries. Based on an exploratory approach, we identify a series of different movement strategies and a range of qualitative contributions that support staying within the carbon budget. These include raising awareness of risks and strategies, enhancing corporate responsibility, being informed about policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, divestment, alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of targeted hydrocarbon activities. While the institutional means are widely used and seem to support policy change and regulation, these strategies are not used to deliver awareness or postponement outcomes. Similarly, while movements tend to rely on civil disobedience to stop hydrocarbon projects in the short term, they rely on multiple strategies to cancel them in the longer term. Our study also indicates significant knowledge gaps in the literature, particularly, cases in Africa and Central Asia, women's participation in these movements, in addition to more quantitative assessments of the actual emissions reduced by social movements.</p>
<p>The levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in the atmosphere continue to grow, despite a worldwide commitment to the Paris Agreement (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Even with emerging climate policies, regulations, and carbon-capture technologies, reaching the Paris Agreement goal remains a challenge. Concurrently, climate activists and environmental justice organisations continue to protest against extracting and processing fossil fuels as a strategy to achieve climate change mitigation (Temper et al., 2020;Villamayor-Tomas and García-López, 2018). As a result, activism towards decarbonisation is becoming a potentially effective force for reducing CO 2 emissions (Klein, 2015). Movements such as 'Blockadia' that mobilise to stop the extraction of fossil fuels and other minerals have become important actors for the transition to a more socially and environmentally just society (Martinez-Alier et al., 2016).</p>
<p>This study aims to improve the understanding of the role that activism against hydrocarbon activities can play in climate change mitigation. The increased attention to social movements contesting fossil fuel use has resulted in a well-defined body of conceptual and empirical studies examining these movements' success and failure against hydrocarbon activities (Owen et al., 2018;Temper et al., 2020). However, these studies are scattered across different disciplines, using different focuses and approaches. Thus, there is a lack of systematic and generalised knowledge linking social movements to limiting or reducing carbon emissions as a decarbonisation strategy.</p>
<p>The establishment of carbon budgets has become a key strategy in combatting climate change. A carbon budget refers to the aggregate amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions permissible between 1817 and 2050 to hold global temperature increases to within 2 • C above the pre-industrial level (IPCC, 2014). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), there is a 66% probability of limiting total human-induced warming (accounting for both CO 2 and other human influences on climate) to less than 2 • C relative to the period 1850 to 1900. To stay well below 2 • C, it would require total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions since 1870 to be limited to approximately 2900 gigatons of CO 2 (Gt CO 2 ) at 66% probability and 2250 Gt CO 2 of CO 2 for 1.5 • C (IPCC, 2021;IPCC, 2018;IPCC, 2014). According to estimated emissions for 2011 to 2017, only 118 Gt CO 2 would remain from the beginning of 2018 to limit global warming to 1.5 • C (Hausfather, 2018). The British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review of World Energy (2018) assessment of reserves indicates that the extensive production of refined oil, gas, and coal reserves would produce respectively 630, 365, and 2037 Gt CO 2 (3029 Gt CO 2 in sum) (British Petroleum Company, 2018). These figures show that world carbon reserves are higher (of about 25 times for 1.5 • C and 15 times for 2 • C) than the combustible amount suggested by the carbon budget allowed to control the rise in global temperatures, even with international efforts to stay within the limit. Both activists and scientists claim for 'Leaving Fossil Fuels Underground' (LFFU), which would be needed for most reserves. In a recent article in Nature, Welsby et al. (2021) found that to allow for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5 • C, by 2050, nearly 60% of oil and fossil methane gas and 90% of coal must remain unextracted. Then, there is an urgent need for alternative strategies for limiting carbon emissions. The carbon budget concept creates a pathway for linking sustainability science with climate mitigation policymakers and grassroots movements. It enables to quantify the amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere before the global temperature rises (Lahn, 2020). The target can, in turn, motivate grassroots environmental justice and resistance movements against fossil fuels to promote just and sustainable decarbonisation pathways. However, while many studies analyse the effect of technologies, market mechanisms, and top-down policies to staying within the global carbon budget, there is a lack of systematic knowledge of the contributions of social movements to climate change mitigation.</p>
<p>Studies on environmental justice movements that contest hydrocarbon activities claim that such actions are crucial for a sustainable and just transformation of energy systems (Bradshaw, 2015;Martinez-Alier et al., 2014;Pearse, 2016;Piggot, 2018;Roy and Schaffartzik, 2021;Temper et al., 2020). An empirical study using several hundred cases of place-based energy-related mobilisations listed in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas.org) -the world largest inventory of environmental conflicts-found that, for 25% of the observations, conflictive projects were either stopped or delayed (Temper et al., 2020). The surge in climate and environmental justice movements is frequently led by local environmental organisations, women in the Global South, and indigenous people who replant trees, chase away loggers, or block mining linked to the extraction of fossil fuels (Federici, 2011;Temper et al., 2018;Villamayor-Tomás and García Lopez, 2021).</p>
<p>According to Pierrehumbert (Pierrehumbert, 2019;Pierrehumbert, 2016), the global carbon budget target can be achieved by: 1) social mobilisation towards decarbonisation, 2) reducing carbon footprints through market-oriented policies and regulations, and 3) alternative energy technologies such as nuclear or carbon capture and storage. The success of the second and the third strategies are contingent on a broad spectrum of social and institutional change. In contrast, social mobilisation towards decarbonisation can be achieved by collective resistance and proactive participation of local communities and civil society actors (Temper et al., 2018). While the climate-mitigation instruments reported in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report address the general role of NGOs as advocates, the specific actions and perspectives of grassroots movements are not addressed. This contrasts with growing evidence about the emergence of social mobilisations against hydrocarbon extraction and processing projects and the capacity of grassroots movements to jeopardise the economic returns of extractive industries (Franks et al., 2014), and, at times, to delay or completely stop the projects (Klein, 2015;Temper et al., 2020).</p>
<p>In light of the knowledge gap concerning collective mobilisations and climate change mitigation, this paper aims to address two research questions: 1) What are the specific contributions of social movements to staying within the carbon budget? 2) Which kind of strategies do movements employ to achieve different outcomes in protests against hydrocarbon activities? This paper systematically reviews academic research papers and book chapters on social movements contesting fossil fuel projects to answer these questions. A qualitative meta-analysis of empirical cases was undertaken after conducting an intensive review and filtering process. The scope of the analysis was limited to understanding the outcomes of social movements against specific hydrocarbon projects at the supply side, particularly against the extraction, processing, and transportation of fossil fuels by states and companies. Studies focusing on movements targeting citizens to achieve demandside changes, such as low carbon lifestyle movements and communitybased energy consumption reforms initiatives and their contributions to emission reduction, are not considered here (see, for example, Biglan et al., 2020;Büchs et al., 2015;Landholm et al., 2019). Based on an exploratory approach, the paper identifies different movement strategies and diverse qualitative contributions relevant for supporting emissions reduction processes. The associations of different movement strategies with the diverse qualitative outcome variables observed in the study sample were evaluated using Pearson Chi-squared tests of independence.</p>
<p>Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework, exploring social movements against fossil fuel activities and strategies to achieve the global carbon budget. Section 3 explains the methodology. Section analyses the results and discusses how social mobilisations against fossil fuels can limit the global carbon budget. Section 5 concludes the analysis and proposes a future research agenda.</p>
<p>From the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, various approaches have been advanced to reduce fossil fuels. Well-known examples are the development of low-carbon technologies, the establishment of carbon pricing and markets, and the promotion of lifestyle changes. Many of the strategies favoured by governments target the demand side (Lazarus et al., 2015;Somanathan et al., 2014). However, the initiatives pursued have been insufficient to limit fossil fuel consumption to stay within the global carbon budget (Covert et al., 2016;Erickson et al., 2018;Godinho, 2020;Piggot, 2018). Therefore, supply-side strategies are also needed to help reach the emissions target. These strategies can be implemented through national and sub-national climate mitigation policy instruments to limit fossil fuel supplies through economic instruments, regulatory approaches, government provision of goods and services, information measures, and voluntary actions (Somanathan et al., 2014). In this context, Piggot (2018) has explicitly argued for exploring the role that activism and social mobilisations against hydrocarbon projects may have in influencing policies that constrain fossil fuel supply.</p>
<p>The multiple ways through which social movements influence social transformations are complex. Social movements, referring broadly to the diverse sets of actors engaging in processes of rational and purposeful collective actions or resistance, may emerge for manifold reasons, for example, in reaction to an authoritative transformation in a society, or over the conflicting interest of resources, values, and cultures (Della Porta and Diani, 2006;Tilly, 2004). Mobilisations tend to differ across geographical, social and political contexts. There can be broad alliances among different stakeholder groups, such as between environmental justice organisations, local communities, indigenous people, minorities and women's groups (Tarrow, 2011) or coalitions of actors across sectors, such as local governments, non-governmental organisations and civil society (Bond and Dorsey, 2010), or a combination of strategies known as "Repertoires of actions" (Tilly, 2004;Tarrow, 2011). Consequently, the motivations, framing, forms of protest, and effectiveness can vary across cases (Benford and Snow, 2000;Tilly, 2004). In this study, we focus the systematic literature review on identifying specific movement strategies and their combinations, as reported in the empirical literature in relation to specific outcomes.</p>
<p>The idea that social mobilisations may play an essential role in addressing environmental concerns and enhancing sustainability has been conceptualized in the growing literature on ecological distribution conflicts (for an overview, see Scheidel et al., 2018). This idea can be traced back and related to various concepts discussing the struggles of grassroots collectives for more just, and sustainable resource uses: environmental justice movements (Bullard, 1994); ecosystem people (Gadgiil and Guha, 1995), ecological resistance movements (Taylor, 1995), eco-political movements (Goldman, 1996), the environmentalism of the poor (Martinez-Alier, 2002), livelihood movements (Robbins, 2004), or politics from below (Borras and Franco, 2013). A common denominator in all these terms is the emphasis given to marginal grassroots groups that fight against environmentally destructive activities that threaten their cultural values and livelihoods. They are primarily concerned about natural resources and ecosystem services rather than monetary matters delivered by the modern economic system (Martinez-Alier, 2002). Given the increasing frequency of environmental protests globally and their interconnection via networks, Martinez-Alier et al. (2016) label this grassroots environmental activism as a "global movement for environmental justice". Many civil society organisations, such as Global Witness (Global Witness, 2020) and, recently, also the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP, 2018), refer to environmental activists and movements as environmental defenders. Their contentious actions that frequently arise out of environmental conflicts in which they oppose environmentally destructive and socially unjust projects have made significant contributions to the promotion of environmental sustainability and social justice regarding natural resource use and management (see, e.g. Escobar, 1998;Lemos and Agrawal, 2006;Scheidel et al., 2018;UN, 2019;Villamayor-Tomas and García-López, 2018;Watts and Peets, 2004). The specific question that we explore in this paper is how and through which contributions, grassroots movements may also promote and pave alternative paths for climate mitigation.</p>
<p>In studies of ecological distribution conflicts, the struggles of environmental justice movements are observed at different stages of commodity chains, including the extraction, transportation, production of goods, and waste disposal stages (Martinez-Alier et al., 2010;O'Connor and Martinez-Alier, 1998). The increase of environmental justice struggles is related to the growth in the social metabolism, that is, the global economy's growing demand for materials and energy that have far-reaching social and ecological consequences, including climate change and environmental injustice (Muradian et al., 2012). Furthermore, even though industrialised countries have developed policies and regulations for reducing carbon emissions domestically, energy and emission-intensive activities are frequently outsourced to other countries, a process known as 'leakage' (Jakob et al., 2013;Lazarus et al., 2015;Somanathan et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding how and with what outcomes resistance to energy-intensive activities occurs across the different stages of commodity chains may provide essential insights for understanding their potential to shape carbon emissions (Martínez-Alier and Muradian, 2015). In this paper, we build on the hypothesis that social movements that contest fossil fuels across different commodity chain stages contribute to reducing, constraining, and politicising carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The study employs a qualitative meta-analysis of case studies following protocols used in similar studies (Villamayor-Tomas and García-López, 2018). Data collection and analysis included three stages. In stage 1, we ran an exploratory review of case studies. These case study designs are helpful when there is little theory on the studied phenomenon, such as the connection between social movements and carbon emissions (McDonough and McDonough, 1997;Yin, 1984). For example, the highest contributing factor to rising global temperatures are the emissions caused by burning coal, oil, and gas for power generation in different sectors (Le Quéré et al., 2012). 1 Thus, the most relevant cases to study in this context are the environmental justice movements around these fossil fuel commodities. Therefore, we explored and screened studies broadly associated with social movements and hydrocarbon-related projects, searching for an appropriate initial list of 'contribution' variables. The search was carried out in
<rs xml:id="12899054" type="software">Scopus</rs> and
<rs xml:id="12899055" type="software">Google Scholar</rs>, and studies were selected based on relevance, i.e., the connection with our research questions. The operational questions used were: "What was the outcome of the case?" "What were the strategies used by the movement to achieve a specific outcome?" and "How often does a type of outcome repeat across all reviewed studies?". In the process of screening the studies, we also paid attention to 'auxiliary' variables, i.e., variables that, although not directly connected with our research questions, could be useful for contextualisation purposes (e.g., country, type of project). As a result of this non-systematic exploratory review, we produced a 'coding book', including an initial list of variables and their definitions (See Table 1, and a series of keywords used in the second stage.
</p>
<p>In the second stage, we carried out a more systematic search and screening of studies in <rs xml:id="12899056" type="software">Scopus</rs> and
<rs xml:id="12899057" type="software">Google Scholar</rs> through the combination of keywords. We combined pairs of words from two groups: one related to the hydrocarbon resource ('emission' 'fossil fuels' 'extraction' 'procession' and 'transportation') and the other concerning social movements ('social movement', 'environmental justice movement' and 'climate justice movement'). The publications displayed in the <rs xml:id="12899058" type="software">Scopus</rs> search from the keyword combinations resulted in 1697 hits with overlapping publications from each combination. We made selections based on relevance to our research questions to filter this initial batch of publications into a manageable set. First, we selected empirical studies published in English as academic journal articles and book chapters. We then screened the content of the studies and selected: 1) studies of social movements that focused on at least one process of hydrocarbon extraction, processing, or transportation (mining, fracking, refineries, coal-fired power plant, pipelines, terminals and shipping) but did not include end-user consumption, to narrow the scope of research; and 2) studies that contained information about the actors that participated in the mobilisation, and explained both the strategies and the outcomes of the mobilisation. Overall, the screening filtered down the initial list to 78 publications.
</p>
<p>In the third stage, we proceeded with extracting the data from the studies, i.e., through the coding process. Again, some studies were discarded here due to a lack of relevant information. Finally, we coded 45 studies, including 57 cases (some articles contained multiple cases), covering 2010 to 2020. The list of publications used is reported in Table C1 (Appendix C). Table 1 shows the variables set up for the studies and their coding criteria. The coding book, outlined in the 1 The CO 2 budget components include the CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, land-use change and forestry; the growth rate of CO 2 in the atmosphere; and the uptake of CO 2 by the 'CO 2 sinks"'in both ocean and land. The emission from fossil fuels is calculated from fossil fuel combustion, which includes gas flaring and cement production. Such data are gathered from energy data on hydrocarbon fossil fuels archived by several organisations (Andres et al., 2012, Le Quéré et al., 2012). Even though the carbon budget does not include gas flaring from coal mining, oil extraction, gas extraction and distribution (Le Quéré et al., 2012), we examined activism against these extractive activities since they still limit the supply of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>supplementary material, provides a detailed explanation of the process.</p>
<p>Finally, the cases are examined using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. First, we ran frequency tables that explore the geographical distributions of the codified social movement cases. Second, we used frequency tables to analyse patterns of outcomes across movement strategies. Thirdly, Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests are used to determine non-random associations between two categorical variables.foot_0 A valid Chi-squared test should fulfil two assumptions: i) the observations are categorised into mutually exclusive variables, and ii) the calculated expected values should be greater than 5 in at least 80% of the cells. We examined Fisher's exact test for more reliable results in cases where expected values are less than 5, possibly due to a low frequency of a particular strategy and outcome pair in the sample. Subsequently, we analyse the combinations that were statistically significant to identify the strongest associations between strategies and outcomes.</p>
<p>The analysed sample has some inherent characteristics and limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the reviewed empirical literature is composed of diverse case studies, which may include typical cases that exemplify more common movement dynamics, as well as extreme or unique cases that include key events such as important movement successes (e.g. winning a case) or failures (e.g. killing of activists) (Bryman, 2012). Results on the frequency of observed outcomes, therefore, reflects only the findings in the available literature, which is a limitation that applies more generally to systematic reviews of case studies. By adopting a qualitative exploratory approach to said outcomes (e.g., identification and classification of "contributions" and "strategies"), we aimed to cover the diversity of outcomes unveiled in the literature. Second, our sample covers only English academic papers and book chapters indexed in <rs xml:id="12899059" type="software">Google Scholar</rs> and <rs xml:id="12899060" type="software">Scopus</rs> but does not cover 'grey literature' or studies published in other languages. Thus, our systematic review reflects state-of-the-art knowledge available in English academic literature but not cases of resistance to fossil fuels that remain undocumented in the academic literature or are only documented in languages other than English.</p>
<p>First, this section presents an overview of the results regarding resistances to fossil fuels across stages of the commodity chain and their geographical coverage. Second, the contributions of social movements to climate change mitigation and their strategies are reported and discussed based on the systematic literature review. Third, a discussion that draws on the results of our study to answer our research question on how social movements contribute to staying within the global carbon budget is presented.</p>

<p>stage, no studies are available for Africa and very few for Asia (Map C). These results highlight the considerable research gap of social movement studies concerning fossil fuels in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. However, countries in East Asia, such as China, Japan and South Korea, are high-emitting countries, and mobilisations against fossil fuel use could be expected to occur, despite the lack of coverage in the literature. Fig. 1 D reveals how the 57 cases of social mobilisations reported in the literature did not equally target all the commodity chain stages. For instance, out of the 34 cases against coal, 28 targeted extraction activities, 31 focused on the processing, and only 23 acted on transportation. In the case of oil, out of 33 total cases, 25 were against extraction, 28 against processing and 25 against transportation activities. Again, out of the 33 cases of contestation against gas, 30 focused on extraction, 20 on processing, and 16 on transportation activities. In the case of coal and oil, the highest number of movement cases was found in the processing stage, while for gas, the highest number was against extraction. Some movements included in the study were reported to protest various types of fossil fuels or were active at different stages of the commodity chain. For instance, some movements against oil were involved in protesting the extraction of tar sands, refinery facilities and transportation through pipelines or shipping. The different combinations of commodities and chain stages simultaneously contested in the case studies are presented in Appendix A (A1 and A2).</p>
<p>Based on the open-ended questions of the coding book (see 'contributions', 'actors and networks' and 'strategies' in Table 1), we created a series of categories of movement strategies, actors involved and outcomes observed in the literature. Table 2 describes these categories and shows their frequency. The discussions of these results are presented in the following section. We identified six different types of strategies, three types of participation, and ten contributions among the 57 observed cases of social movements. One case commonly involves multiple strategies, contributions, and forms of participation. This is because the social mobilisations were described not as a single event at a single point in time but as a process over time that can involve various actors, places, forms of participation and outcomes. The specific combinations of strategies and outcomes found in the literature are listed in Appendix A (Table A3 andA4).</p>
<p>This section focuses on the relationship between mobilisation strategies and contributions to limiting carbon emissions. Table 3 provides a summary of these relationships. The following subsections review the Notes: Indicated numbers refer to the number of cases documented in the literature sample. In some cases, the movement against one commodity would target multiple chain stages. For instance, some movement against the oil commodity would involve extracting tar sands, the refinery facilities and the transportation through pipelines or shipping. That is why numbers in the graph add up to more than 57 (see, for example, that the total number of cases for the coal commodity equals 82). The different combinations of commodities and chain stages simultaneously contested in the case studies are presented in the appendix. Source: Authors. results for each of the contribution categories. Among the six different mobilisation strategies, up to five different strategies were employed in one protest case. Furthermore, the contributions observed within one case can involve immediate changes at the project level, such as postponing or stopping a project, as well as institutional changes, new regulations, the promotion of energy democracy and just transitions. Therefore, the contributions of social movements are not limited to contesting hydrocarbon activities at the local level, but achieved outcomes can be relevant to broader social transformation processes occurring at different levels.</p>
<p>Out of the 34 cases that raised awareness, more than three-quarters involved protests, and the large majority used multiple strategies. Only half implicated civil disobedience or campaigns, while very few used lawsuits, lobbying, or violence. The coding criteria for raised awareness include when the movement contributed to disseminating the message, information, or knowledge about limiting fossil fuels and emissions to individuals, organisations, corporations, and governmental agencies. It is also categorised as such when the movement was presented successfully as a symbolic victory, which means it does not produce the desired result, but the effort made was acknowledged or legitimised. Furthermore, a case was considered to raise awareness when it influenced or mobilised other actors in the climate justice and decarbonisation movement. An example of raised awareness includes two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region of Australia (Pearse, 2016): 'Stop T4' and 'Groundswell' mobilised in Newcastle and Gloucester. The Stop T4 coal terminal campaign focused on air quality, health impact and preserving the landscape from coal mines and port facilities.</p>
<p>The literature includes 26 movements that delayed the targeted The movement contributed to achieving a change by corporations and companies to limit the over-exploitation of resources or reduce their environmental and social impact. Notes: The categories are ordered by frequency. One case can qualify for multiple strategies and contribution pathways; therefore, the sum of observations across categories can be higher than the total sample size (n=57).

<p>activity for at least one month to several years, stopping the emission or impacting future emissions between these periods. These movements overwhelmingly engaged in multiple strategies (92%). Eighty-five per cent had protested, while 62% and 58% used civil disobedience and campaigns, respectively. A good example at hand is the Keystone XL pipeline case in the US. President Biden revoked the construction permit of this long-disputed project on his first day in office on 20th January 2021. This outcome was not yet reported in the observed samples. The XL pipeline in this study was considered as a postponement outcome due to the grassroots actions. In the project proposal, the pipeline would have delivered 830,000 barrels per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast of the US. The processing of this amount of oil is equivalent to 147 to 168 million metric tons (MMTCO 2 ) of emissions per year (Bradshaw, 2015).</p>
<p>Twenty-four cases contributed to the creation of new regulations. The regulation category is selected when the movement contributed to enacting a set of rules or creating laws and regulations enforced by legal institutions. Compared to policy change, these cases involved a higher share of confrontations. One of the cases is Limity jsme my ("Limits are us!"), a grassroots social movement in the northern Czech Republic ( Černoch et al., 2019) that emerged in response to the government's initiatives which aimed to nullify coal mining limits by 2015. As a result of the resistance, the ČSA mine in Northern Bohemia had to keep the limits. The mining activities at the ČSA have gradually declined since then (Bradshaw, 2015;Černoch et al., 2019). Another example is the resistance to a set of legislative decrees known as "The Law of the Jungle", which would allow 60% of the Peruvian Amazon forest to be granted to multinational corporations. After more than two weeks of protests by 1250 indigenous communities, Congress was forced to repeal the legislative decrees.</p>
<p>The study found sixteen cases of movements that stopped fossil fuel activities completely, either for an ongoing project or a project planned to operate in the future. They all used multiple strategies, the majority of which were protests, civil disobedience and campaigns. Interestingly, 38%of the cases involved lawsuits, the highest share of lawsuits among the different outcomes. Between 2012 and 2017, several coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) were shut down in the US, including the Salem Harbor, the Valmont, the Fisk, and the AES Redondo Beach power plants, built between the 1900s and 1960s (Grant and Vasi, 2016). These outcomes are related to activists' efforts using direct action, legal confrontations and entering into coalitions with the local governments. Cancelled fossil fuel projects in one place do not necessarily translate into overall emission reductions because of leakage problems; for example, the cancellation of planned CFPP in one place leads to the opening of new ones in other places. However, social mobilizations, particularly those achieving cancellation of hydrocarbon projects, make their operation significantly more costly (Franks et al., 2014), arguably incentivizing alternative energy sources. Moreover, in some cases, old power plants were closed, and new CFPPs were being prevented. For example, in Germany by networks of environmental organisations, such as Climate Alliance Germany (CAG) and Fossil Free Germany (FFG). Since 2008, CAG managed to successfully prevent 18 out of 30 planned German coal facilities, preventing 94.7 million tons of CO 2 emissions (David, 2018).</p>
<p>There were sixteen cases in which movements contributed to fossil fuel divestment. Contrary to other outcomes, these cases showed the lowest share of multiple strategies (69%) and civil disobedience (44%). On the other hand, it had the highest share of campaigns (69%). Fossil fuel divestment generally refers to "the act of disinvesting from publicly traded fossil fuel companies", the largest fossil fuel companies with proven reserves (Stephens et al., 2018, p.1). In the case of coal</p>

<p>As a result, these awareness displays have pressured the investing company to exit from the extraction projects (Brown and Spiegel, 2017).</p>
<p>Thirteen cases contributed to just transitions. Most used multiple strategies, mainly protest and civil disobedience, which was reported most frequently in relation to this outcome (77%). The term 'justice and energy transition' in the literature has several connotations. These movements aim to achieve justice by confronting hydrocarbon regimes from different perspectives: intergenerational justice, justice for indigenous and tribal peoples, and justice for ethnic minorities. Just transition thus requires the involvement of the local communities, local workers and indigenous people directly affected by the projects. Moreover, justice is pursuable when the activist's values and responses towards the hydrocarbon regime are supported by the resistance culture of a particular group of people who were oppressed or negatively affected by the hydrocarbon economy. One of the cases included in this category is the case of Climate Camp Scottland action against the Mainshill open-cast coal mine, where climate activists were able to address the negative impacts on the surrounding community and were supported by the community (Scandrett, 2016). Two cases against hydrocarbon policies in Ecuador and Bolivia also fell into this category because these movements were heavily supported by the Amazonian Indigenous people and the employees of the hydrocarbon industry who were directly affected by the oil and mining development (Perreault and Valdivia, 2010). Moreover, studies based on the global Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas) (Pérez-Rincón et al., 2019;Scheidel et al., 2020;Temper et al., 2020) have explored how mobilisations around fossil fuel conflicts can positively contribute to more just and sustainable transitions.</p>
<p>Twelve cases resulted in creating a new policy or a change in a specific aspect of an existing policy related to reducing carbon emission. In these cases, more institutional means were used than confrontation. These cases include the movement that resulted in creating a new policy or a change in a specific aspect of the old or new policy related to reducing carbon emission. The policy here means the national policies such as environmental, energy, and resource management policies that influence at a national or transnational level. Policy change sometimes, but not necessarily always, comes with concrete legislation or regulations that influence limiting emissions. For example, one of the cases explored is the case of California's climate policy shift in reducing hydrocarbon industries, particularly in limiting permits for new oil wells. In this case, the shift towards supplyside policy was steered by the public interests in fossil fuel extraction and social movements towards a low-carbon society (Erickson et al., 2018). The sample also includes the well-known cases in Colombia and Ecuador, "leave the oil in the soil" or leave the "unburnable fuels" underground initiated by local indigenous communities, which became public policy for six years in Ecuador with the Yasuni ITT proposal, 2007-2013(Vallejo et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Although only eleven cases led to CSR, it appears that most involved multiple strategies, including protest, civil disobedience, campaign and lobby/coalitions. Conversely, only two used lawsuits and none engaged in violence. In recent years, the strategies pressuring corporations to stop exploiting human and natural resources have changed from lobbying and coalitions to targeting firms directly through the term 'private politics' coined by Baron (2003, 74). This form of strategy is a more coordinated and organised form of social punishment. It includes 'name and shame' campaigns, cooperative labelling schemes, social media shaming and certification systems (Thörn and Svenberg, 2016). For example, the case of the anti-fracking movement in Ireland resulted in allowing fracking activities to proceed under self-regulation to eliminate the potential effects on groundwater resource pollution and community safety. Later, local authorities banned these activities (Hooper et al., 2016;Steger and Drehobl, 2018). Examples of CSR used by movements include a Swedish case of shaming multinational corporations to change their exploitive behaviours. The idea is to dismantle socially constructed barriers that support incumbent fossil fuel providers, which are more deeply rooted than other market forces.</p>
<p>Energy democracy means achieving a more distributed, locallybased energy system with a regionally appropriate mix of different renewable sources satisfying 100% of society's energy needs through progressive social change (Stephens, 2019). Interestingly, the eight cases that led to energy democracy showed protests without violence. Out of eight cases, five engaged in civil disobedience. Additionally, they did not involve lawsuits. The outcome is classified as energy democracy when smaller administrations units such as states, villages, and cities achieve autonomy and control over energy production. One of the cases is the United States' community choice aggregation (CCA) industrial transition movement in California, which has contributed to local, democratic control over electricity (Hess, 2019). Such outcomes and movements can also be found in cases from Thailand's countryside (Pa Deng network) and the Philippines' Palawan Province movements (Marquardt and Delina, 2019). These local communities envisioned the future of energy supply, moving away from the dominant hydrocarbon regime to more sustainable renewable energy systems.</p>
<p>Only six cases led to market solution outcomes. They contributed to forming a new market, proposing new renewable energy sources, technology, and infrastructure to reduce fossil fuel demand. All involved protests and none used violence. Interestingly, four of the six resulted in a market solution that involved civil disobedience as a strategy. Authors categorised it as an outcome when the movement contributed to forming a new market, proposing new renewable energy sources, technology, and infrastructure to reduce fossil fuel demand. Some movements may bring solutions in the renewable market in drafting policies, but it is not always the case. An example is the climate change solution think-tank, "Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE)'s movement" in Australia, which established a bottom-up, deliberative process with local communities to envision ways to deploy renewable energy technologies locally (Pearse, 2016). Another example illustrates how the mobilisation of Chilean environmental organisations led to opportunities for renewables to enter the electricity market in collaboration with experts from local universities and renewable energy companies (Madariaga and Allain, 2018).</p>
<p>After exploring the different outcomes delivered by social movements, we ran a Chi-squared test of independence to determine whether the sample's outcomes and strategies variables are independent of or associated with each other (Franke et al., 2012). 3 Table 4 shows the results of the Chi-squared tests with a P-value less 3 The formula for the Chi-squared test is</p>
<p>, where O is the observed (the actual count of cases in each cell of the table), E is the expected value, and n refers to the number of cells in the table (Mchugh, 2013).</p>
<p>than P &lt; 0.05, which allows rejecting the null hypothesis of independence. 4 The entire list of cross-tabs and test results is reported in Table B1 (Appendix B). Moreover, we included the Fisher's exact test's P-value for the categories with the expected value less than 5. The cases are ordered by strategies (presence or absence) in rows and outcomes (presence or absence) in columns. The cells report the observed frequency and expected values (in parentheses) for each category. To understand the differences between groups, we compared the observed and expected values (Mchugh, 2013). Firstly, we observe a difference in the occurrence of postponement and cancellation outcomes when comparing the movements that use multiple strategies and those that do not. As shown in the table, when movements rely on multiple strategies, postponement outcomes tend to be more frequent (24) than expected (20.5), and cancellations too (16 as compared to 12.6 5 ). By the same token, in the absence of multiple strategies, the postponement and cancellation outcomes tend to be less frequent than expected. These findings align with previous studies suggesting that tactical diversity is an effective strategy of environmental movements to block specific development projects (Scheidel et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Civil disobedience also makes a difference. The results show a significant association between the civil disobedience strategy and the postponement outcome. The postponement outcome is more frequent (17) than the expected value of (13.2) when the civil disobedience strategy is used. The same is true in the case of just transition and repression outcomes. Achieving a just transition outcome is more frequent than expected when civil disobedience is employed as a strategy. Also importantly, civil disobedience tends to be associated with violent repressions of activists compared to other strategies (Burkett, 2018;Grant and Vasi, 2016).</p>
<p>The lobby/coalition strategy is significantly associated with raised awareness, postponement, policy change and regulations outcomes. The outcomes of policy change and regulations occur more frequently than expected when lobbying is used and vice-versa (Fisher's exact P = 0.022). The opposite occurs with the awareness raising and the postponement outcomes. These outcomes relatively less frequently occur when lobbying is present. Also, the movements that use lawsuits/litigation have a statistically significant higher frequency of postponement outcomes than expected. These associations can be explained by the nature of the lobby/coalition strategy, which relies on institutional "venue shopping" to the detriment of, e.g., the joint use of public spaces and public voicing strategies along with other non-governmental actors.</p>
<p>Also, we looked specifically at the participation of three different civil society groups in the sample: women's organisations, professionals in medical science, lawyers and scientists, and indigenous people and minority groups (Table 5). We did not find statistically significant associations between the participation of women and professionals in movements and any of the outcomes; however, the results indicate that movements that are participated by indigenous people are more frequently associated with awareness-raising and just transition outcomes than otherwise. 6 Last but not least, indigenous group-participated movements were also more frequently associated with repression and violence outcomes than otherwise.</p>
<p>In January 2019, Special Report 1.5 revised the remaining GCB to 420 GtCO 2 to keep the global temperature within 1.5 degrees (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). Even with increased emission cuts, nations are likely to fail in reaching the goal of the GCB target. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and consider alternatives, including the role of social movements. The linkages between social movements and the reduction of carbon emissions can take many forms, making it difficult to establish a causal relationship. Social movements are dynamic and form a chain of processes involving different mobilisation strategies, actors and outcomes. Furthermore, the heterogeneous social, political, and cultural contexts of the different movements make drawing one-toone comparisons challenging (Della Porta and Diani, 2006;Tilly, 2004). Nevertheless, as shown in this study, it is still possible to identify and draw preliminary patterns about said strategies, actors and outcomes across contexts.</p>
<p>In this systematic review, we find that social movements can contribute to staying within the global carbon budget in a variety of indirect and direct ways. These range from raising awareness of risks and strategies, promoting knowledge transfer, and pressuring corporations to engage in corporate social responsibility or divestment actions, to bringing policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, and alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of hydrocarbon activities. These findings complement previous knowledge on the watchdog role grassroots organisations and ENGOs monitor environmental conditions and ensure that polluters do not violate standards (Grant and Vasi, 2016;Madariaga and Allain, 2018;Steger and Drehobl, 2018). More broadly, the findings support and expand previous claims about the importance of 'governance from below' and the role of social movements as a recognisable challenge to transnational extractive corporations and 'business as usual' in the climate change context (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006;Villamayor-Tomas and García-López, 2018;Scheidel et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Our findings also illustrate that the studied movements tend to rely on multiple mobilisation strategies. As pointed out by social movement scholars, the use of multiple strategies at once or sequentially would be explained by the need to fit a changing environment, e.g., in response to counter-measures implemented by governments and multinational corporations (Della Porta, 2013). Furthermore, and also shown in our analysis of contributions, movements often pursue different goals, requiring different sets of strategies. While the institutional means of lobbying and coalition building are widely used and seem to support policy change and regulation, these strategies are not used to deliver awareness or postponement outcomes. Similarly, while movements tend to rely on civil disobedience to stop hydrocarbon projects in the short term, they rely on multiple strategies to cancel them in the longer term. Last but not least, our study shows that mobilisation also comes at the price of increased violent repression and criminalisation against activists, despite the absence of violence from the protestors, which warns us about the dramatic trade-offs that involved movements face between promoting change and maintaining well-being and safety in their communities (Del Bene et al., 2018;Scheidel et al., 2020). Also, our findings show that outcomes of mobilisation against fossil fuels are not independent of each other. The cases in the sample (Burkett, 2018;Martinez-Alier et al., 2016;Pearse, 2016) reveal that raised awareness, CSR and divestments can be linked together. At the same time, while postponement is a contribution on its own, vis a vis limiting carbon emissions, they can also pave the way to cancellation. For example, the postponement of the XL pipeline projects contributed to years of delaying emissions from the project until its recent official cancellation. In the meantime, similar mobilisations in Chile, Australia, and the US achieved the outcome of policy-making and market solutions 4 We decided to include only statistically significant associations in our analysis as an attempt to digest the results for the reader. Thus, we used statistical significance as a proxy, or rule of thumb, to identify the strongest associations between strategies and outcomes. Generally speaking, stronger associations are more likely to be statistically significant. To be sure, although some strategies did not have a significant association with the outcomes, they are still relevant strategies (the movements employed these strategies and authors of the reviewed studies pointed out to them for a reason); however, our sample did not contain sufficient evidence about their relative stronger associations with outcomes as compared to other strategies. See Appendix B1 for the entire list of cross-tabs and test results. 5 Based on Fisher's exact test (Fisher's exact P = 0.013) (given that the expected value is lower than 5) 6 Fisher's exact test was conducted given expected value less than 5. (Grant and Vasi, 2016;Madariaga and Allain, 2018;Pearse, 2016). Likewise, in several cases in the United States, Argentina, Algeria, and cross-countries studies (Hess, 2019;Hess, 2018;Martinez-Alier et al., 2016;Riffo, 2017), the exhibited regulation and energy democracy were also interconnected. These findings illustrate the interest of applying a 'cycles' lens to mobilisation strategies, the co-evolution of social movements and their impact (Oliver and Myers, 2006;Snow and Benford, 1992;Tarrow, 1989;Tilly, 1978;Traugott, 1995). 7 Further research should explore our data from this perspective. Last but not least, our findings suggest that indigenous communities, scientists and women's groups play non-deniable roles within the movements against hydrocarbon activities. A recent report by Oil Change International and Indigenous Environmental Network claimed that more than 700 million metric tons of annual Co2 emissions were prevented by indigenous resistance in the US and Canada (Oil Change International, 2021). This research also indicates the critical role of indigenous people in shaping a future with low carbon emissions. In addition to their role featuring resistance actions, our study illustrates their role as inspirational actors that raise awareness about climate change and justice.</p>
<p>As a limitation, it is essential to note that our search of studies resulted in limited cases from East Asia and African countries. However, the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas, n.d.) has documented globally hundreds of cases of protests against fossil fuels and for climate justice (Africa 141, Asia 142), suggesting that there is a substantial lack of peer-reviewed articles in the areas identified in this study.</p>
<p>The study aimed to understand the diverse contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget by systematically reviewing academic research papers on activism against fossil fuel extraction, processing, and transportation. After conducting an intensive preliminary review, a qualitative meta-analysis of 57 selected cases of anti-fossil fuel movements was undertaken. The results showed that social movements constrain fossil fuel supplies, support social and political processes needed for climate change mitigation, and potentially avoid emissions through at least ten different contributions. The findings further identified how the specific contributions to staying within the global carbon budget were associated with the different movement Notes: **, and *** refer to 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively.</p>

<p>7 'Cycles' refers to protest cycle dynamics, which entails shifts in the types of actions/strategies and shifts in the combination of actions across time. These actions can be varied as confrontational protests, mass demonstrations, institutionalized politics and violence (Oliver and Myers, 2006;Tilly, 1978).</p>
<p>strategies and the participation of specific actors, such as indigenous people involved in mobilisations. In this context, scientists, sciencepolicy interface institutions, notably the IPCC, and policymakers, should pay more attention to the contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget. Additionally, the analysis indicates that indigenous participation in movements significantly contributes to limiting fossil fuels; however, the possibility of violent repression is undeniably high. Therefore, the protection of indigenous people's right to defend their traditional way of life and ancestral lands should be highlighted in climate change mitigation frameworks and pathways to achieve global carbon budget goals.</p>
<p>The findings from our study confirm several arguments in the existing literature and add systematic evidence to the body of research. Firstly, our findings support existing arguments claiming that fossil fuel resistance movements create viable pathways and important political spaces to achieve climate mitigation targets. Moreover, the results yield new evidence that nuances popular assumptions regarding how social movements contribute to decarbonisation. According to our findings and qualifying previous studies (Biglan et al., 2020;Büchs et al., 2015;Landholm et al., 2019), there is a different approach to mobilisation between the lifestyle changes movements and movements that target hydrocarbon supplies. While both types of movements share the objective of limiting emissions, the former tend to use a non-confrontational approach directed to a broader audience (i.e., consumers) (Büchs et al., 2015), while the latter frequently employs more confrontational and direct actions.</p>
<p>Also, our analysis extends the argument on movements as forces of sustainability (Temper et al., 2020) by providing evidence on the diversity of mobilisation strategies and contributions and identifying associations between both. We found the use of multiple strategies to be particularly effective for achieving the postponement of projects, in addition to lawsuits and civil disobedience. While the sample considered reveals more confrontational, direct action than the institutional lobby/ coalition approach in the movements, the results firmly suggest that direct action and confrontation can effectively delay emissions.</p>
<p>Secondly, the study provides further evidence for the existing claims that marginalised people, in alliance with other segments of society, contribute to global environmental and climate justice through collective resistance against unsustainable resource use, such as hydrocarbon activities. These alliances are identified in various grassroots movements that include women, indigenous people and minorities, and professional communities to form partnerships across the social spectrum. From a climate justice perspective, participation from vulnerable groups, indigenous people, and movements from the Global South is vital in shaping more just energy transition pathways and climate change mitigation (Campion, 2021).</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis reveals research gaps that can inform a future research agenda at the intersection of ecological economics, political ecology and social movement studies. For instance, women's participation in these movements is under-researched in the academic literature. Similarly, Africa and Asia are severely under-represented in social movement studies looking at protests against fossil fuels. Therefore, we expect future studies on movements against fossil fuels to address these gaps by including the types of under-represented populations and geographical areas identified in this paper. Furthermore, this study revealed that postponement and cancellation of hydrocarbon activities are crucial outcomes of social mobilisations, suggesting that social movements may have a tangible impact on limiting the global carbon budget. However, based on the information available in the surveyed literature, it has not been possible to estimate the actual amount of carbon emissions reduced by these actions. This remains to be further explored in future research.</p>

<p>The study identified cases of social movements targeted at multiple fossil fuel commodities simutainaously. Furthermore, a single type of fossil fuels can have overlapping commodity chain stages. These overlapping combinations are shown in Tables A1 andA2. Furthermore, we also identified multiple strategies and multiple contributions in a single case study. Few cases were identified using single strategies, while protest is most likely to be an overlapping strategy among the combinations. These combination of strategies identified in the sample of the study are listed in A3, and the contributions in A4.</p>
