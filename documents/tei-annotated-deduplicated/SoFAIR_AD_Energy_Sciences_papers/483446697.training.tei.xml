<p>Analysing hydrogen supply chains is of utmost importance to adequately understand future energy systems with a high degree of sector coupling. Here, a multi-modal energy system model is set up as linear programme incorporating electricity, natural gas as well as hydrogen transportation options for Germany in 2050. Further, different hydrogen import routes and optimised inland electrolysis are included. In a sensitivity analysis, hydrogen demands are varied to cover uncertainties and to provide scenarios for future requirements of a hydrogen supply and transportation infrastructure. 80 % of the overall hydrogen demand of 150 TWh/a emerge in northern Germany due to optimised electrolyser locations and imports, which subsequently need to be transported southwards. Therefore, a central hydrogen pipeline connection from Schleswig-Holstein to the region of Darmstadt evolves already for moderate demands and appears to be a no-regret investment. Furthermore, a natural gas pipeline reassignment potential of 46 % is identified.</p>
<p>It has only been recently that some of the biggest economic zones of the planet have given pledges and target years for becoming climate-neutral, among them China, the European Union and Japan [1]. The German government resharpened the climate goals at the beginning of May 2021 announcing to reach net-zero emissions by 2045 [2]. Already prior to that, the EU Hydrogen Strategy [3] and the German National Hydrogen Strategy [4] were published. These promote the application of hydrogen (H 2 ) across the sectors electricity, heat, transport and industry to advance the transformation towards a carbonneutral energy system. One reason for that is that H 2 can be stored in large quantities and thus helps to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) within its versatile field of application. For instance, green hydrogen produced from renewable sources can be used to decarbonise industries such as steel and ammonia production as well as the transportation sector by directly using H 2 in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) or processed as synthetic fuel in internal combustion engines for heavy duty road transport, ships or trains.</p>
<p>Since the prospective H 2 generation and usage locations can differ from each other, a well-designed H 2 transport infrastructure will be needed to fully foster the potentials outlined above.</p>
<p>Yet, there is no public H 2 pipeline infrastructure in Germany to date. There is, however, a first memorandum of understanding for a connection planned to be established in the northwest of Germany by the end of 2022 [5]. It aims to take advantage of the well-developed natural gas infrastructure in Germany to quickly establish the pipeline-bound H 2 transport connection at low cost via repurposing existing pipelines while at the same time building only few new dedicated sections. This reassignment potential of the existing natural gas grid is acknowledged not only in industry, but also in politics and research (e. g. [4,[6][7][8]).</p>
<p>The relevance of existing gas transport infrastructure is, inter alia, shown in the difficulties of the last years in trying to extend the electricity grid in Germany to make it fit to accommodate the volatile RES wind and sun. First, there are the costs and reservations from the public regarding the required extension of the electricity grid as well as the difficulties of long-term storage of electricity. Second, a standard pipeline can transfer up to ten times as much energy at a significantly lower investment cost compared to a 380 kV twin overhead power line [9]. Additionally, Germany exhibits the fourth largest gas storage capacities globally that can supply the German demand for about 80 days [10]. Approximately 60 % of all gas storage sites are salt caverns [10], which are considered as also being suitable for H 2 utilisation [11,12]. Contrary to that, H 2 feed-in restrictions considering the gas grid pose the risk of not being able to fully exploit the potential of wind electrolysis [13]. This emphasises the role but also the challenges of existing natural gas infrastructure in a future multi-modal energy system that in-creasingly relies on H 2 and derived renewable gases. A holistic approach on modelling energy transport considering electricity, natural gas and H 2 is necessary to sufficiently take all these interactions into account and ensure a cost-optimal hydrogen supply infrastructure for Germany.</p>
<p>Several authors analysed and optimised future hydrogen transportation options by applying different methods. In an investigation focused on US states, which includes the options of pipeline transportation as well as gaseous hydrogen (GH 2 ) and liquid H 2 trailers, Yang and Ogden made a first effort to find the lowest-cost H 2 delivery mode [14]. They found that for densely populated areas with a large hydrogen demand, pipeline transportation is most cost-efficient, whereas for moderate or low demands liquid H 2 trailers or GH 2 trailers are more economical. Ball et al. made an early approach of setting up an energy system optimisation model for the assessment of a German transport system based on H 2 with the target year 2030 [15]. Some of their findings are that introducing H 2 leads to a remarkable reduction in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from early phases on and that in densely populated areas it leads to minimised infrastructure costs. In [16], an analysis of H 2 pipeline infrastructure in Germany with the target year 2050 is carried out by Baufumé et al. based on a geographic information system, where fuel stations serve as demand sinks and transmission and distribution is investigated on level 3 according to the Nomenclature des Unités Territoriale Statistiques (NUTS) scheme developed by the EU. In that model, an approach to use predefined routes for a possible grid infrastructure to avoid for the pipelines to cross forbidden or implausible areas is implemented. Krieg [17] attempts a comprehensive forecast for a H 2 pipeline grid in Germany to supply a future FCEV demand. Therein, it is investigated which routes of existing infrastructure like rail lines, freeways and the natural gas pipeline routes are most suitable as orientation for a H 2 grid. Robinius built up on that work using the rail and natural gas networks as orientation [18]. He further investigated different market designs for the utilisation of H 2 in the transport sector to subsequently evaluate them in a multimodal energy system model of the German electricity and gas sectors, including H 2 pipelines.</p>
<p>For Great Britain, the decarbonisation of the transport sector focusing on the interplay of electricity and H 2 networks to reach an optimal design of an integrated energy system is investigated by Samsatli et al. using a mixed-integer linear programme [19]. New H 2 pipelines are assumed to be built next to existing ones to be able to neglect rights of way costs. The problems of limited temporal resolution and sectoral scope of that study are partially resolved in [20], where the focus is on the role of renewable H 2 and storage for the heating sector in Great Britain. It is found that repurposing the natural gas grid to hydrogen utilisation only has little positive influence on the system costs. This stands in opposition to Cerniauskas et al. [7], who conduct a cost assessment for a perspective repurposing of natural gas pipelines to H 2 usage in Germany. One of their key findings is that pipeline reassignment can reduce H 2 delivery costs by at least 60 %, while around 39 % of the total transmission pipeline length are assumed to have a reassignment potential, based on estimates regarding the existence of parallel pipelines. Backing of the reassignment potential of existing natural gas infrastructure can also be found in the so-called European Hydrogen Backbone, which was published by several European gas transmission system operators [21]. In its recent extension of mid-2021 [8], 69 % of the approximately 40 000 km-long H 2 transmission network is projected to come from repurposed natural gas pipelines by the year 2040.</p>
<p>An economical assessment of power-to-hydrogen and powerto-gas including the option to feed into gas pipelines is performed by Schiebahn et al. [22]. They conclude that it is inefficient to convert H 2 to methane to be able to transport the product through the existing natural gas grid, so H 2 should rather be used directly, which would necessitate a dedicated H 2 infrastructure. Welder et al. design an energy system model that covers the German state of North Rhine-Westfalia in high spatial detail to evaluate five distinct H 2 reconversion options, in which the pathway that features reconversion with combinedcycle gas turbines results to be most cost-effective [23]. Due to its focus, the study has a rather limited technological scope, however, and also does not include natural gas transportation. Another techno-economic model is published and applied by Reuß et al. to analyse a hydrogen supply chain for the German road transport sector [24][25][26]. The authors consider GH 2 transportation in pipelines and trailers as well as liquid H 2 trailers as well as those transporting liquid organic hydrogen carriers. One conclusion is that pipelines are a cost-effective transportation option in regions with higher hydrogen demand. Also Emonts et al. focus on the German road transport to analyse different pathways for establishing renewable H 2 as fuel [27]. They find the combination of pipeline transportation and underground storage to be most cost-efficient for high-demand scenarios, whereas for low demand liquid hydrogen and liquid organic hydrogen carriers are more favourable options. An indepth analysis of H 2 trailer transport options at different pressure levels was conducted by Lahnaoui et al. [28]. Their study results in the finding that higher-pressure trailers are more economical for high H 2 demand.</p>
<p>Haumaier et al. perform a potential analysis for power-to-gas technologies in Germany based on a geographic information system considering gas grid restrictions [13]. It is found that the feed-in capacities of the existing pipeline transmission infrastructure in Germany can restrict the located power-to-gas potentials. For that investigation-congruent to the presented paper-the publicly available LKD-EU data set [29] is employed.</p>
<p>A European energy system model including H 2 infrastructure and investigating 38 historical weather years is presented by Caglayan et al. [30]. Key findings are that more renewable energies within a region lead to lower electricity costs, which in turn favours the H 2 production in these regions. A similar approach to the presented paper in terms of multi-modal energy transport infrastructure that includes the electricity, natural gas and H 2 transmission networks was published in [31]. In that joint study of a gas and an electricity-grid transmission system operator, pathways for a German and Dutch energy system that go beyond the currently existing network development plans are presented for the target year 2050. As in the present paper, the development of the power-to-gas technology and the related energy transportation infrastructure is analysed with a 95 % decarbonisation target. Thereby, a simplified representation of actual transmission assets is used based on aggregated energy transmission capacities between regions. A system-cost minimisation is applied and the spatial resolution is largely on NUTS 2 level for Germany (without city states), NUTS 1 level for the Netherlands and country level for the rest of Europe. Nevertheless, the H 2 supply chain does only consider H 2 pipelines for the hydrogen transport.</p>
<p>Finally, an investigation featuring a multi-modal German energy system that also encompasses both electricity and gas transportation is presented by Gils et al. [32]. Its distinguishing characteristics are the wide range of modelled technologies as well as a pathway to climate neutrality until 2050. It does not include H 2 transmission via trailers, however, and the chosen regional resolution of Germany in that study is distinctly lower than in the presented paper (eleven versus 38 regions), which in comparison results in a less detailed representation of inner-German energy flows.</p>
<p>The literature research shows that even though existing studies have investigated on a future H 2 transportation infrastructure in Germany, most of them put a focus on particular aspects of the H 2 supply chain and are thus limited with regards to multimodality. Adversely, investigations that employ a temporally and regionally highly resolved optimisation model are rather rare and either focus on different countries, are less detailed in terms of regionalisation or do not include the option of different H 2 import routes to Germany.</p>
<p>With this paper, the existing literature is complemented by investigating a future H 2 supply chain in Germany in an hourly and spatially highly resolved multi-modal energy system model. This includes the optimisation of differentiated H 2 import routes, inland electrolysis, storage as well as pipeline and trailer transport options, which have not been considered together in any previous model known to the authors. The central research question of the presented work is how a future H 2 supply chain for a decarbonised Germany 2050 could look like considering different projected H 2 demand volumes. This is addressed by evaluating the energetic H 2 demand in eight different scenarios in the form of a local sensitivity analysis, which is carried out to cover uncertainties about actual future H 2 demands. As part of the applied linear programming approach, transport restrictions for electricity, natural gas and H 2 are implemented. This finally also allows for the identification of potential natural gas pipeline reassignment connections.</p>
<p>The employed energy system model with H 2 supply chain is presented in Section 2. Detailed explanations are given on how the H 2 demand, supply and transport infrastructure is modelled as well as on the performed procedure of the local sensitivity analysis of the H 2 demand. Results of this modelling approach are presented in Section 3, followed by a discussion (Section 4) and the conclusions (Section 5).</p>
<p>In this chapter, the multi-modal energy system model is described. The general setup of the model is presented in Section 2.1 along with the applied modelling framework. The overall H 2 supply chain implemented in the multi-modal energy system model used in this study is composed of the elements mentioned in the Sections 2.2 to 2.7 and is illustrated in Figure 1. As depicted, a switch in mode of transportation is possible from pipeline to trailer, but not vice versa. This is because we assume that trailers commonly transport smaller volumes of H 2 (cf. [24]), which would not reach a sufficient utilisation for pipelines if the mode of transport is switched from trailer to pipeline. Further, the distribution of H 2 within one region is assumed via trailer transport and modelled based on an estimated cost factor. This cost estimate is 6.15 ect/kWh [25]. 1 In Section 2.8, the approach of the performed sensitivity analysis of H 2 demand is introduced.</p>
<p>The employed energy system model is formulated as a linear programme using the modelling framework Energy System Development Plan (ESDP), which is described in [33] and applied in an updated version in [34]. The developed model of Germany is adopted from Kolster et al. [35] for the electricity and heat sector and extended from the year 2030 to the year 2050. Both models share the same base assumptions on techno-economic parameters for electricity and heat generation. The model developed for the present analysis, however, is the first in ESDP to feature a hydrogen supply chain including pipelines and trailers as well as a natural gas infrastructure representation. These are introduced and presented in the following sections.</p>
<p>The model is formulated using
<rs xml:id="12899048" type="software">GAMS</rs>
<rs xml:id="12899049" type="version" corresp="12899048">30.3.0 Minor Release</rs> from March 6, 2020 and solved using the
<rs xml:id="12899050" type="software">CPLEX</rs> optimisation package
<rs xml:id="12899051" type="version" corresp="12899050">12.12.0.0</rs>. The optimisation aims at minimising the total system costs while balancing demand and supply for each hour of the year. CO 2 emissions can be restricted for different years. Additionally, several constraints are formulated based on the modelled scenarios, which depend on techno-economic parameters, which are managed using a
<rs xml:id="12899052" type="software">PostgreSQL</rs> and <rs xml:id="12899053" type="software">Post-GIS</rs> data base. The regionalisation approach is based on the EU's NUTS classification system which is orientated at administrative boundaries [36]. The NUTS 2 level is chosen for the focus region Germany, which corresponds to 38 government districts. In addition, 13 countries that have a grid-bound energy exchange with Germany (electricity and/or gas) are represented on country level. 2 As sole exception the Russian energy system is not modelled explicitly and the distance for the gas transport to the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is set Figure 1: Hydrogen supply chain including all modelled technologies, conversion processes and pressure levels. Pressure differences from one process to the following are just indicative in the model, as they imply the need for compression which is entailed with costs and losses according to Table 7. The respective compression units are marked with "c 1 " in the diagram.
</p>
<p>to 1224 km corresponding to the actual length of the only existing connection, which is the Nord Stream pipeline [37]. 3 Apart from this special case, distances between regions are modelled as centroid-to-centroid connections.</p>
<p>All relevant technologies from the electricity and heat sector implemented in the model for Germany are listed in Table D.8 with their corresponding capacities and energies respectively. For the transmission of electricity, net transfer capacities (NTCs) are calculated. The alternating current (AC) electricity grid is modelled with publicly available data from the transmission system operators from the years 2016/17. Additionally, all network development measures for high voltage direct current (HVDC) lines projected to be built by the year 2030 in [38] are implemented in the model. Electricity import and export capacities are based on [38] and [39].</p>
<p>In 2019 about 55 TWh of H 2 were consumed in Germany evenly distributed between the chemical and petrochemical industry [4]. To further decarbonise all sectors, future applications of H 2 in the industry, heat, transport and power sector is discussed. Driven by the EU and the German National Hydrogen Strategy, the future demand is commonly projected to grow in all sectors but with diverging quantified volumes reaching up to a total of 400 TWh in Germany [40]. This uncertainty can pose an obstacle today for planning and developing the necessary H 2 infrastructure. To overcome this, we model varying H 2 demand volumes and assess the required H 2 infrastructure for each scenario as described in Section 3.1.</p>
<p>Analysing the H 2 transportation capacities requires a regionalisation of the total H 2 demand. Since we assume the transport sector to constitute a major share of the H 2 demand in 2050, we use it to distribute the total demand among the 38 NUTS 2 regions of Germany. This is done on the basis of market penetration rates published by Cerniauskas et al. [41] for a medium H 2 penetration scenario for the transport sector as shown in Table 1. In addition to the original source, H 2 -driven domestic shipping is considered with a market penetration of 75 %.</p>
<p>In the transport sector, population and vehicle density are strong indicators for the refuelling demand of passenger cars and buses. Following the methods presented by Cerniauskas et al. [41] and Rahmouni et al. [42] those indicators are used to allocate the passenger hydrogen demand. For the road freight transport it is assumed that most refuelling activities are concentrated in regions with a high road freight traffic performance measured in tonne-kilometres. International road freight transport is thereby included. Furthermore, future H 2 demand of trains is allocated to the NUTS 2 regions only by diesel-train refuelling stations since it is not expected that trains already running on electrified railways are switched to H 2 -based drive trains. Finally, since inland waterway vessels refuel at departure and arrival destinations, inland ports weighted by their annual freight handling are used to distribute potential H 2 refuelling demand of domestic vessels. International shipping and aviation are not considered for the demand distribution within this study. Figure 2 shows the resulting normalised H 2 demand distribution, which is assumed for all scenarios based on the market penetration rates presented in Table 1. The overall hydrogen demand in this scenario adds up to about 150 TWh, which is referred to as the base scenario in the following. Further, the temporal distribution of this demand is based on hourly road traffic volumes in Germany from the year 2011 [43].</p>
<p>In order to supply the future H 2 demand, different import routes as well as inland production with water electrolysis, utilising a proton-permeable polymer-electrolyte membrane, are considered within the model. While international sites with high wind or solar potential are suitable for low-cost H 2 production, transportation from these regions to Germany can come along with relatively high costs [44,45]. In this paper, imports are modelled in competition to producing H 2 in Germany facing adverse site-specific conditions such as higher electricity costs and less full load hours (FLH) of the electrolysers [44,45]. We only consider imports from international sites already discussed in literature and politics. The model incorporates different H 2 import routes as shown in Figure 3. All assumptions refer to the import at the German border. The routes differ in terms of cost assumptions, maximum available H 2 supply volume to Germany and NUTS 2 import region. In northern Germany, H 2 imports from Norway via Denmark using a new H 2 pipeline are assumed based on [45]. Moreover, since the harbour of Rotterdam plays a major role in energy imports (coal and oil) for the European Union already today, its future potential as central hub for H 2 imports is discussed increasingly. Reassigned natural gas pipelines or newly built H 2 pipelines can transport H 2 to Germany. The assumed import costs are based on the production in high potential wind regions in South Chile and Argentina, shipping of liquid H 2 towards Rotterdam and gaseous transport via pipelines towards Germany [44,45]. These imports are modelled to arrive directly in the western regions of Germany or via Belgium along already existing natural gas pipeline routes. The import volume is not restricted, assuming that further worldwide locations could also supply H 2 . Furthermore, imports in the southwest of Germany via France are considered. The cost assumptions are based on H 2 produced from solar power in Spain transported by newly-built H 2 pipelines [45]. Furthermore, we limit the imports from Southern Europe to the combined potential from Spain and France. Finally, Northern Africa with its high potential for solar power is considered as promising region to produce large amounts of green H 2 . The model incorporates its H 2 imports via pipelines over Italy and Switzerland or via Spain and France towards the region of Freiburg in the south of Germany based on [45,46]. Finally, the import potential is restricted to 470 TWh according to the projected potential from Morocco in [45]. Nevertheless, in [46] a similar import potential via pipeline of 400 TWh from Northern Africa is calculated as combined potential from Morocco and Tunisia.</p>
<p>The technology-specific costs for H 2 production in Germany in 2050 are set according to Table 2. As indicated in there, the electricity consumption for this technology is supplied by the optimised hourly electricity mix within the region of installation. It consists mainly of renewable energies, but the output of the electrolysis cannot be considered as completely green H 2 since the electricity mix in 2050 within the 95 %-decarbonised model can still feature a small amount of natural gas burned in gas power plants. The electrolysis capacity is optimised in each NUTS 2 region within Germany based on the regional electricity costs, the potential FLH and the infrastructure costs for transporting H 2 towards the demand centres. Thereby, the scarce resource of intermittent renewable electricity still needs to meet other electricity demands such as for households, industry, traffic and power-to-heat applications. Furthermore, electricity transmission is limited by NTCs. H 2 exports and transits are not considered within this analysis.</p>
<p>The basis of the natural gas and therefore also the derived H 2 pipeline infrastructure builds a data set developed within the 'LKD-EU' project [29], which is referred to as LKD-EU data set in the following. At the time the present study was developed, it was the most extensive openly accessible data set on pipeline infrastructure for Germany known to the authors. 4 Due to the lack of capacity data 5 and to develop a consistent representation of gas transportation capacities, new capacities are assigned to all pipelines within the data set. To do so, pipeline classes and diameters, which are given for most entries, are used to calculate transportation capacities according to the values given in Table 3. For each respective class a transportation capacity is assigned to each pipeline based on the given diameter in the data set by linear interpolation between the upper and lower bounds defined in Table 3. The energy transportation capacities shown in Table 3 are estimates originally derived from Kunz et al. [49]. According to that report, the values can be regarded as an upper boundary of the actual transportation capacities. They are calculated with the assumptions of a maximum mass flow speed of 10 m/s, a net calorific value of 49.725 MJ/kg and ideal gas conditions. Table 3: Pipeline classification used to assign capacities to natural gas pipelines in the LKD-EU data set from [29] (table adopted from [13] and [49]).</p>
<p>Transport In a next step, all pipelines connecting the same two regions are aggregated to one inter-regional transmission capacity. All inner-regional pipelines which do not cross an administrative NUTS 2 border are neglected. Since there is no information on the direction of the gas flows included in the LKD-EU data set, this approach yields an undirected grid representation with the same transportation capacity for both directions. To obtain a directed gas grid representation, the year 2020 is parametrised according to known power plant capacities [50,51]; natural gas import and export volumes as well as natural gas demands per NUTS 2 region of the year 2015 [29,49]. While the interregional gas transportation capacities are optimised, a physical representation of gas flows is not considered. This optimisation run allows to identify the most probable gas flow directions between all regions. The resulting representation for the natural gas transmission grid on NUTS 2 level for Germany is shown in Figure B.10. The additionally depicted cross-border capacities to grid neighbours are an aggregation of values derived from [52]. Different natural gas import routes are considered in the model from the Netherlands (directly or via Belgium), Russia (directly or via Poland or the Czech Republic) and Norway (directly or via Denmark) according to the cross-border capacities of the existing natural gas grid.</p>
<p>set [29], 238 have an assigned transport capacity in GWh/d, the others are 0 or left blank.</p>
<p>Based on the representation derived for the natural gas grid as presented in Section 2.4, the optimiser can build up interregional H 2 transmission capacities. Since the energy system is modelled as linear programme, a minimum pipeline capacity restriction cannot be defined model-endogenously. This would turn the problem into a mixed-integer programme which would necessitate a far higher amount of computational resources. Consequently, very low capacity pipelines can be built up by the optimiser. This is resolved by manually removing all interregional pipeline connections that are below a minimal threshold of 750 MW in a post-processing. This value is 90 % of the minimum inter-regional capacity in the gas grid data set [29] in NUTS 2 aggregation. The transported volumes of the removed pipelines are concurrently shifted to trailer transportation.</p>
<p>For building up a H 2 pipeline, the optimiser assumes linearly increasing investment costs with increasing transport distance and capacity. The calculation of these costs is based on the nonlinear equation Eq. (1) as derived from Krieg [17] and also used in Reuß et al. [24]. This Eq. (1) uses the pipeline diameter d to estimate the investment costs per meter. An average diameter of 753 mm is applied here for newly constructed H 2 pipelines based on the average diameter of the aggregated natural gas grid capacities derived from the LKD-EU data set. As described above, the costs also depend linearly on the capacity. Hence, an average pipeline capacity of 5 GW is assumed based on an interpolation of the average diameter using Table 3. The assumptions on technological and economic parameters for building pipelines are summarised in Table 4.</p>
<p>Table 4: Assumed techno-economic parameters for hydrogen pipelines in 2050 based on [17], [24] and [25]. * This cost assumption is based on Eq. (1) with an average pipeline diameter of 753 mm and a corresponding 5 GW average pipeline capacity.</p>
<p>As alternative to the pipeline-bound transportation of H 2 , the possibility for GH 2 trailer transportation is implemented into the model. Techno-economic assumptions are taken from [24] and [25] as listed in Table 5.</p>
<p>H 2 can be stored, for instance, in salt caverns or in pressure vessels [53]. The model considers only vessels at a pressure level of 250 bar [24,54], which can be installed in each region either centrally or decentrally within the demand location. They are assumed to be located in the vicinity of the electrolysis plants (cf. Section 2.3) or the end-user site, e. g. a refuelling station, and thus need no further transportation infrastructure. Table 6 shows the corresponding assumed techno-economic parameters. No differentiation is thereby made between central and decentral storage vessels. To reach the needed pressure levels in each conversion step, (de)compression is assumed as indicated with a "c" in Figure 1. For the explicitly modelled compressor units "c 1 " between electrolysis and storage as well as between storage and pipeline, pipeline and GH 2 transport and distribution trailer, the cost assumptions are given in Table 7. The listed losses are due to leakage and arise per compression process. Additional compression costs to make up for pressure drops along a pipeline segment are included in the pipeline cost equation Eq. (1) [17]. Compression costs for imports are assumed to be included in the import prices, re-compression costs between two assets with the same H 2 pressure level, e. g. storage to trailer, are not considered. Further, the compression costs for trailer distribution and at the demand location are assumed to be part of the distribution cost estimate as described in the beginning of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Knowledge about future H 2 demands is important for planning a hydrogen supply infrastructure. Since this is a highly Table 7: Assumed techno-economic parameters for compressor units "c 1 " (cf. Figure 1) in the year 2050 based on [24,44]. The same assumptions are used for reversed inlet and outlet pressures. The operation and maintenance (OM) costs are defined as share of the initial investment costs. uncertain parameter, a local sensitivity analysis varying the annual H 2 demand of Germany from 50 TWh to 400 TWh is conducted to investigate the impact of different exogenously given demands on the supply and transportation infrastructure. The H 2 demand thereby is the only input parameter being varied. This analysis focuses mainly on the optimised output of the H 2 supply chain: The H 2 transportation capacities for pipeline and GH 2 trailer transmission, the H 2 import volumes and routes, the storage vessels as well as the electrolyser locations in Germany. In addition to the optimised H 2 supply chain investments and operation, all scenarios optimise the RES capacity and operation for the target year 2050 (cf. Table D.8), the hourly electricity imports and exports, batteries as well as sector-coupling technologies such as heat pumps and heat storage technologies. Additional H 2 demand can occur in the optimisation in gas power plants or for heating technologies within the model. However, these options are not used by the optimiser, so this is not further mentioned in the following.</p>
<p>The results from the optimisation of the linear programme and its corresponding assumptions as described in the previous Chapter 2 are presented below. A map of Germany showing its NUTS 2 regions and their hereafter utilised names can be found in Figure A.9 in the appendix.</p>
<p>All scenarios from the local sensitivity analysis (cf. Section 2.8) share the same set of base assumptions. A weighted average cost of capital of 7 % and a 95 % CO 2 emission reduction for the target year 2050 compared to 1990 is assumed, which corresponds to an upper limit of 52.6 million t. To ensure a high security of H 2 supply, a strategy of diversification is considered. Therefore, each import route needs to be developed within the model to a specified minimum of at least 5 % from the total H 2 demand in the base scenario. 6 This is specifically important for the most expensive imports from overseas to the western regions of Germany. We assume that a central European hub such as Rotterdam will be established for the European H 2 supply. The distribution of the H 2 demand to the NUTS 2 regions is assumed as described in Section 2.2 and to stay the same throughout all scenarios. The normalised distribution is however scaled by the total hydrogen demand within 6 As mentioned before, the base scenario is defined as the scenario with 150 TWh hydrogen demand. each scenario. To provide a broader understanding of the results, the installed capacities for electricity and heat generation in the base scenario are listed in Table D.8. The total electricity consumption in the base scenario including losses and endogenously optimised technologies such as heat pumps and electrolysers is 969 TWh and the space and process heat demand is assumed to be 1072 TWh. The results of the demand variation as indicated in Figure 5 reveal that an increasing H 2 demand changes the H 2 supply structure mainly based on assumed import prices and upper import limits as described in Section 2.3. First, it shows that import volumes from overseas and Southern Europe remain very low; the former due to high prices, the latter due to limited supply potentials. Second, two phases can be identified. The first phase (1) for demands of up to 150 TWh and the second phase (2) from 200 TWh to 400 TWh. In phase 1 starting at a H 2 demand of 50 TWh, the model shows a balanced supply from all available options. Increasing demands in Germany are supplied by ramping up the import volumes primarily from Northern Europe. As the maximum import volume of 90 TWh from Norway is exploited in the base scenario in Germany, phase 2 is initiated at an H 2 demand of 200 TWh. This phase is characterised by increasing import volumes from Northern Africa up to a level of 260 TWh. Furthermore, both phases also differ in the installation rate of electrolysers in Germany represented by the slope of the dark blue line in Figure 5. While 1.5 GW capacity of new electrolysers are installed for every additional 50 TWh of H 2 demand in phase 1, this rate drops down to 0.32 GW on average in phase 2. For phase 1 this corresponds approximately to 1 GW electrolyser capacity per 10 million passenger fuel cell electric vehicles. To supply each German region in the base scenario, a total of 11 GW GH 2 trailer capacity and 73 GW pipeline capacity are installed within the model. Temporally differentiating supply and demand patterns are balanced by 37 GWh of predominantly decentral GH 2 storage vessels. These energy storages contribute with 5 % to the total energy storage capacity within the multi-modal energy system, including heat, battery and pumped hydro storage units.</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows the supplied H 2 energy within each German region differentiated by mode of transportation (pipeline or trailer) and origin (imported or locally generated by electrolysis). Further, it shows the aggregated exported H 2 from each region to another inner-German region. The major share of imports from abroad lands in Schleswig-Holstein in the north of Germany and Freiburg in the south. Smaller shares are imported directly to regions at the western borders to France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Especially regions along the main north-to-south pipeline connection (cf. Figure 2.5) such as Schleswig-Holstein, Lueneburg and Kassel pass through up to 100 TWh of H 2 towards the south, thus making up a major share of transmission infrastructure investments. These regions are also mainly supplied via pipeline. Lueneburg is an exception as it is supplied by trailer and uses the pipeline primarily to transmit the energy further south. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that regions with H 2 supplies below 4.9 TWh/a are only connected via trailer, for instance Dresden and Lower Bavaria.</p>
<p>The centralised supply structure, which relies heavily on imported H 2 as described in the previous Section 3.2, requires a transportation infrastructure to supply all demand regions in Germany. Therefore, the model builds up pipeline and trailer capacities. Figure 7 shows the optimised transportation capacities for H 2 pipelines between the 38 German regions for the eight defined demand scenarios. While the colours indicate the installed inter-regional pipeline capacity, the arrows indicate the predominant H 2 flow directions. Regions without a pipeline connection are supplied by trailers. An exception to this are the regions of Trier and Saarland in the southwest of Germany which are directly supplied by imports via Belgium and France within all scenarios (cf. Figure 6).</p>
<p>In the base scenario, a well-established pipeline network transports the imported H 2 from Northern Europe as well as the H 2 produced in Northern Germany to the south. A maximum capacity of 13 GW is required for the first inter-regional pipeline connection from Schleswig-Holstein to Lueneburg. The capacity of the last segment of the major north-to-south connection ending in Karlsruhe is 1 GW. A second pipeline connection with a similar capacity supplies the region of Karlsruhe from the south. Southern imports mainly arrive in Freiburg transporting H 2 predominantly to the major demand region of Upper Bavaria.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the demand sensitivity analysis shows that the optimised pipeline network correlates with the underlying supply structure. The resulting optimised H 2 network in the scenarios can also be categorised in phase 1 and phase 2 as described in Section 3.2. The base scenario thereby shows a fully devel-oped network structure in phase 1. Figure 7 additionally reveals that a central pipeline connecting the north, herein the region of Schleswig-Holstein, and the south, namely the region of Darmstadt, is already established at a H 2 demand of 50 TWh. This connection with several exit points along the way is expanded until a demand of 150 TWh is reached.</p>
<p>A first pipeline connection transporting only H 2 from electrolysis starting in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and leading to Brandenburg/Berlin is established in the 50 TWh scenario. This connection is expanded to a capacity of 3 GW at the end of phase 1. Simultaneously, a second pipeline connection is built to transport electrolysis H 2 and imported H 2 from Schleswig-Holstein to the regions in the east of Germany.</p>
<p>In phase 2 the increasing H 2 demand within all regions requires more imports from the south. This results in a less developed north-to-south pipeline network since the available supply volume from the north can only satisfy the increasing demand in the northern regions. South-to-north connections are established instead.</p>
<p>At 200 TWh a south-to-west pipeline connection is built up supplying major demand regions in the west. Thereby, no exit points are built along this connection up to the region of Cologne. The region of Koblenz, for instance, which lies along this south-to-west connection, is supplied entirely by trailers (cf. Figure 6). From a total demand in Germany of 250 TWh on, this region is connected to the pipeline network from Darmstadt. The maximum inter-regional capacity of 35 GW occurs at a demand of 400 TWh between Freiburg and Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>To reduce the costs of H 2 transportation, existing natural gas pipelines could be reassigned to transport H 2 . We identify interregional connections where a pipeline reassignment would be applicable without interfering with the remaining required gas transportation capacities.</p>
<p>Since Germany plays an important role today as gas transit country [49], gas exports mainly to France, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands need to be considered for a natural gas grid utilisation analysis. With the assumption of gas transits through Germany decreasing to 25 % of the volumes in 2017 (in line with the overall European gas demand reduction in the 'Optimised Gas' scenario in [55]), the endogenously determined German gas demand in the model decreases to 143 TWh. 7Figure 8 shows the maximum occurring load factor of each inter-regional connection assuming a demand reduction in neighbouring countries to 25 % compared to 2017. Since most inter-regional connections in our model are built up with more than one pipeline in reality [29], we base the identification of potential reassignments on a maximum load factorfoot_6 of about 0.5. While red lines indicate inter-regional connections with a maximum occurring load factor greater than 0.5, green lines indicate connections which could potentially be reassigned. Grey lines are connections where a reassignment seems feasible, but further investigations are required.</p>
<p>Overall, it shows that about 46 % of all inter-regional connections in the natural gas grid are never utilised more than 50 %. Furthermore, the average utilisation of the entire natural gas network lies at about 29 %. With reduced imports especially from Russia compared to today's volumes, Figure 8 shows that the maximum occurring load factor of the large inter-regional capacities within the northeast of Germany are below 50 %. In contrast to that, the lower capacities of the highly connected network in the western regions of Germany are still highly utilised. Potential reassignments are exemplarily discussed at the end of Section 4.</p>
<p>As the results indicate, the H 2 supply for Germany will depend on imports. This holds true if supply chains from international high potential renewable locations, e. g. in Europe or Northern Africa, can be established to costs equal or below 7.9 ect/kWh of H 2 (cf. Figure 3). Within the optimisation a H 2 supply from Norway as the first major import route is built up. Even though this could already change with slightly different import cost assumptions, this import route still seems to be highly relevant and reasonable for first major pipeline connections. This can be argued due to lower regulatory and political challenges as this route crosses fewer countries and territories compared to the one from Northern Africa.</p>
<p>For the inland electrolysis the results indicate a higher installation rate in phase 1 compared to phase 2 (cf. Figure 5 for the definition of these phases). This can have several reasons:</p>
<p>• First, electrolysers are already installed in the most costefficient locations in the northern regions of Germany. The two regions with the major share of electrolyser capacity, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, have the greatest combined wind and solar capacities and therefore on average the lowest electricity costs. Compared to these regions, the optimisation output reveals 16.5 % higher electricity costs on average, for instance in Weser-Ems, a region showing a high potential for electrolysis in other studies such as from Haumaier et al. [13] or Metzger et al. [56]. Additionally, further utilisation of installed electrolysers would only be possible at higher electricity prices, which results in levelised H 2 costs greater than the assumed import prices of 7.9 ect/kWh from Northern Africa. This statement is also supported by the expansion of newly installed capacities in phase 2 only in the region of Brandenburg operating for just 2617 FLH compared to 3346 FLH in Schleswig-Holstein. Furthermore, the levelised cost of installations in the south of Germany seem not to be competitive with the H 2 import prices.</p>
<p>• Second, in phase 2 the pipeline infrastructure from north to south is less developed and more regions are supplied by imports from the south. The limited north-to-south connections restrict further sales of inland-produced H 2 to southern regions and can therefore reduce the competitiveness of produced H 2 in northern Germany. From this observation we interpret that a H 2 supply infrastructure from north to south favours the installation of electrolysers in Germany due to the access to a larger market area.</p>
<p>The optimised pipeline networks indicate that connecting major demand centres such as Cologne and Duesseldorf in the west as well as Upper Bavaria in the southeast via pipeline to central import or production regions (cf. Figure 7) is more cost-efficient than e. g. decentral H 2 production or the supply via trailers (cf. Figure 6). A further analysis shows that this holds true even for import prices of 12 ect/kWh. From this it can be derived that a fully connected pipeline network is most cost-efficient within the multi-modal German energy system as modelled for the year 2050. Since a linear approach including a post-processing (cf. Section 2.5) is used to evaluate the share of trailer and pipeline capacity, it is to mention that 6 GW of installed pipeline capacities are shifted to trailers within that post-processing. This is about 7 % of the total H 2 transportation capacity within the model. While this postprocessing directly effects the presented statements about the regional H 2 supply mode for regions with low H 2 supplies below 4.9 TWh (cf. Section 3.2), it is argued that it increases the plausibility and economic feasibility of the remaining identified pipeline connections. Furthermore, the regional supply assessment (cf. Figure 6) can give an indication on which regions in Germany are most important for implementing a H 2 economy.</p>
<p>Those are the regions with the highest overall H 2 energy supply and exports, such as Schleswig-Holstein, Lueneburg, Hannover, Detmold and Kassel. Even if the order can change with an increasing H 2 demand and thus with an increasing supply from the south via Freiburg, these regions still keep the importance already identified in the base scenario. Nevertheless, an economic impact of or requirements for infrastructural investments per region cannot be directly derived from Figure 6. This is inter alia due to the fact that the geometric size varies from region to region, which could result in different required pipeline lengths and different H 2 distribution grid investments. Further, the size of a region correlates with the transport distance for H 2 within the model, because of the utilised simplification of centroid-to-centroid connections. This can favour the usage of trailers as mode of transportation, which occurs for the small regions of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg. Especially since the geographical centres of Brandenburg and Berlin are just about 3.2 km apart, the supply via trailer to Berlin is strongly affected by the chosen regions within the model. In contrast to that, the results for these highly populated areas still seem reasonable in terms of whether a region is connected via a large transmission pipeline. This is because large pipeline transportation infrastructures would most probably occur only outside of cities and a distribution via trailer or smaller underground distribution pipelines would be more realistic.</p>
<p>Inferring from the local sensitivity analysis, a pipeline connection from import entry regions in Northern Germany with potential inland electrolyser locations can be considered as noregret investment. The optimisation already shows the macroeconomic benefit of this infrastructure in the 50 TWh scenario. In line with the National Hydrogen Strategy this enables and increases the market for H 2 production sites in Northern Germany. Nevertheless, these findings refer only to the assumed H 2 demand distribution and a green H 2 supply of the assumed demand. A further no-regret connection can be identified from Schleswig-Holstein via Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Brandenburg/Berlin. This already shows to be a central backbone for supplying regions in the northeast of Germany at a H 2 demand of 100 TWh. Furthermore, especially the natural gas pipeline network in these northeast regions has the potential to be reassigned to transport H 2 .</p>
<p>Within a European context an intensified network structure in the west connecting industry clusters in the Netherlands and Germany could increasingly dominate the picture as shown in the European Hydrogen Backbone [8,21]. Although our results do not show that, an intensified H 2 pipeline network in the western regions including a cross-border connection to the Netherlands could still be beneficial already in early stages of a H 2 economy. This is due to the two circumstances that no industry clusters are considered in our model, and the allocation of the demand centres is based on the transportation sector alone. With our results reflecting the approach of a multi-modal energy system optimised for the target year 2050 we contribute to the discussion with a variety of demand scenarios and indicate that even industry clusters in the west could benefit from a centralised H 2 supply from Northern Europe and Northern Africa due to significantly lower costs compared to imports at the harbour of Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Finally, reassigned natural gas pipelines could reduce the transport costs of H 2 . Even though this analysis is not supposed to suggest real pipeline reassignments, it gives a first impression whether pipelines along major future H 2 corridors still have a crucial importance for methane transportation in Germany in 2050. Further, natural and green gas import origins could be different in the year 2050 than assumed. What is shown by the analysis, however, is that the asset utilisation in general decreases to 34 % leaving room for reassignments.</p>
<p>A 40 GW inter-regional connection consisting of several nonparallel pipelines mainly transporting imported Norwegian natural gas via Denmark from Schleswig-Holstein further south today is only utilised up to 50 % in 2050 (Figure 8). In addition, Figure 7 concurrently emphasises the importance of a H 2 pipeline with a capacity of 13 GW being built between the same regions throughout all scenarios. Therefore, this connection can be an ideal candidate for a pipeline reassignment to minimise the transportation costs of H 2 . In a recently published pre-feasibility study a similar corridor is investigated by the responsible transmission system operators for gas to connect Denmark and the Hamburg region with a H 2 pipeline [57]. Further along this route, the optimisation shows that reassigned pipelines could transport the H 2 at least up to the region of Detmold, where the pipeline density significantly increases. Further reassignments in this western area are not identifiable from this study. This can be in contrast to studies with a more detailed representation of the natural gas network with the reason being that our approach neglects pipelines that lie only within one NUTS 2 region, since only the inter-regional transportation capacities between two NUTS 2 regions are considered. The sensitivity analysis shows that with increasing hydrogen demand above 150 TWh, the importance of the H 2 connection in the southwest from Freiburg to Karlsruhe grows significantly. When building a pipeline in this hilly region, the Black Forest Natural Park poses restrictions on possible routes. With the applied approach to suggest building pipelines along existing natural gas pipelines, this connection would be allocated in the west of the Black Forest along the river Rhine and the border to France. This is where the major European Trans Europa Naturgas Pipeline (TENP) is situated consisting of multiple pipelines [29]. Figure 8 indicates that the natural gas transport along this route could decrease significantly to a maximum annual utilisation rate of about 20 %, which therefore makes it another candidate pipeline for reassignment. Nevertheless, it is to be emphasised that the required hydrogen capacity for the 400 TWh scenario could exceed the existing natural gas transportation capacities by up to a factor of six. After all, the assumptions about the European natural gas demand-in this case especially for Italy and Switzerland-are crucial parameters to be reconsidered for evaluating the robustness of this reassignment suggestion in future work.</p>
<p>With the future importance of H 2 as energy carrier within the next decades in Germany, large investments are required to build up a sufficient H 2 infrastructure. To deal with the uncertainty of the future demand of H 2 in the planning process, we use a multi-modal energy system model and apply a local sensitivity analysis varying this demand. This allows us to identify major hydrogen supply routes as well as a dedicated hydrogen pipeline network for the year 2050. Therefore, we contribute to the discussion by showing a variety of scenarios and building up a comprehensive hydrogen supply chain as part of the multimodal model including detailed H 2 import routes. We find that connecting major demand and supply centres via pipeline is already macroeconomically beneficial at low H 2 demands of 50 TWh/a. Further, our analysis shows the importance of considering detailed H 2 import routes to identify suitable pipeline connections. A central north-to-south connection through Germany is shown to be a no-regret option (operated in one or the other direction). A second no-regret connection is found to link Schleswig-Holstein with the regions in the northeast of Germany such as Brandenburg and Berlin.</p>

<p>Table D.8 lists relevant technologies from the electricity sector integrated in the model for Germany with their installed capacities. Whenever the word optimised appears, it indicates that the corresponding value is not exogenously specified, but calculated endogenously by the solving algorithm. These optimised values are shown for the base scenario. For gas power plants we assume values from the German NEP 2030 (2019) [38] as upper boundaries for 2050, while biomass and pump storage are fixed to the values presented in that report. Waste and run-ofriver power plants are implemented with today's capacities for the year 2050 [50].</p>
