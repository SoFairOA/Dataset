<p>Clean energy and a sustainable environment are grand challenges that the world is facing which can be addressed by converting solar energy into transportable and storable fuels (chemical fuel). The main scientific and technological challenges for efficient solar energy conversion, energy storage, and environmental applications are the stability, durability, and performance of low-cost functional materials. Among different nanomaterials, perovskite type LaFeO3 has been extensively investigated as a photocatalyst due to its abundance, high stability, compositional and structural flexibility, high electrocatalytic activity, efficient sunlight absorption, and tunable band gap and band edges. Hence, it is urgent to write a comprehensive review to highlight the trend, challenges, and prospects of LaFeO3 in the field of photocatalytic solar energy conversion and environment purification. This critical review summarizes the history and basic principles of photocatalysis. Further, it review in detail the LaFeO3, applications, shortcomings, and activity enhancement strategies including the design of nanostructures, elemental doping, and heterojunctions construction such as Type-I, Type-II, Z-Type, and uncommon heterojunctions. Besides, the optical and electronic properties, charge carriers separation, electron transport phenomenon and alignment of the band gaps in LaFeO3based heterostructures are comprehensively discussed.</p>
<p>In the 21 st century, the rapid consumption of fossil fuels by modern society has caused worldwide energy and environmental issues [1]. These are the most serious problems that trouble us physically, economically, and our daily lives. The energy and environmental issues are being linked to some diseases that are around currently. These issues are continuously becoming worse day-by-day [2,3]. Many factors are present for why the energy and environmental issues become worse around the globe. However, if people of the globe were to tackle these problems, it would absolutely help both the environment and the people live in it [4]. It is expected that the current CO2 emission in atmosphere as a result of fossil fuel combustion will increase the average temperature of the globe up to 6 o C till the end of 21 st century that will convert the global glacial climate to an ice-free Antarctica [5,6]. In contrast, the accelerated release of harmful agents by industrial activities has resulted in worldwide air and water pollution which has affected both human beings and the surrounding [7]. Thus, to tackle the energy shortage and the associated environmental tribulations, it is a big challenge for the research communities to search for alternative sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies [8,9]. Nowadays, solar energy as a sparkling and renewable energy source is used as an alternative to fossil fuels [10]. The consumption of solar energy by semiconductor photocatalysts can produce H2 through water reduction, convert CO2 to useful chemicals, and oxidize various pollutants [11,12]. Thus, semiconductor photocatalysis has been considered clean, economical, renewable, and safe technology [13]. Since the first report on TiO2 photocatalysis, [14] this field has attracted tremendous attention of scientists all over the world. Numerous semiconductor photocatalysts including ZnO, [15][16][17][18] SnO2, [19,20] BiVO4, [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] BiOCl, [30] SrTiO3, [31][32][33][34][35][36][37] WO3, [38][39][40][41][42] Fe2O3, [43][44][45] Ta2O5, [46][47][48][49] BiFeO3, [50][51][52][53][54] Bi2WO6, [51,[55][56][57][58][59] Cu2O, [60][61][62] g-C3N4, [63][64][65][66][67] MoS2, [68][69][70][71] WS2, [72][73][74] Graphene, [75][76][77][78] Carbon nanotubes, [79,80] etc. have been extensively employed in photocatalytic solar fuel generation and environment purification.</p>
<p>Many promising environmental techniques for photocatalytic disinfection of water and CO2 reduction for green and renewable energy have been developed [81][82][83][84][85].</p>
<p>In semiconductor photocatalysis, highly reactive short-lived species are formed on a semiconductor surface under exposure to light energy with wavelength greater or equal to its bandgap [86][87][88]. The high oxidizing and reducing power of these species can induce pollutant degradation, CO2 reduction reactions, and water splitting [89][90][91][92].</p>
<p>Perovskite-type lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO3) as a visible light active (Eg = 2.0 eV) p-type semiconductor has received great attention in scientific research [93]. The general formula used for perovskite-type oxides is ABO3, where site "A" represents rare-earth ions and site "B" represents transition metal cations [94]. The physical and chemical properties of LaFeO3 are quite distinct from other material that's why it is employed in superior technologies like electromagnetic materials, solid oxides fuel cells, gas sensors, and catalysts [95,96]. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of LaFeO3 is still insufficient for efficient photocatalysis due to the small surface area of bulk material, limited solar energy consumption, fast charge carriers recombination and positive conduction band (CB) bottom level [97]. The performance of LaFeO3 generally depends on the structure, shape, and size, and the synthesis process will have a great influence on it [98]. Several methods for synthesizing perovskite-type LaFeO3 have been reported, such as the sol-gel, hydrothermal, sonochemical, solvothermal, microwave assisted, and co-precipitation [99]. Among these, only the sol-gel method can produce small and identical LaFeO3 nanoparticles [93]. However, due to its high surface energy, LaFeO3 nanoparticles easily agglomerate, leading to a severe decrease in performance [98]. An effective strategy is to introduce pores in LaFeO3 by various template methods [100,101].</p>
<p>In addition to the synthesis strategy, the optical absorption of LaFeO3 can be extended by incorporating dopants into its lattice [102,103]. Based on the estimated valence band (VB) level of LaFeO3 (2.2 V), photo-induced holes possess adequate energy to commence oxidation processes with H2O/OH -or could oxidize various pollutant directly [104]. Therefore, it is very important to reduce the inherent band gap of LaFeO3 by elemental doping. The surface states generated by the incorporated dopants will shift the top of its VB upward to a certain extent. As a result, its photocatalytic activity would greatly improve. As reported, the conduction band (CB) level of LaFeO3 is positioned at 0.2 V versus the potential of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and is unsuitable for reduction processes. Nevertheless, it can generate high-level energy electrons (HLEEs) above 0 V, which quickly relaxes to the CB bottom and release its potential energy. To utilize these electrons in photocatalytic reduction reactions, it is recommended to design a rational strategy by coupling semiconductors with proper band alignment [105]. Beyond the conventional type-I, type-II, and Z-type heterostructures, uncommon heterojunctions have been developed by some researchers. In such types of heterojunctions, wide bandgap photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc. are coupled with narrow band gap semiconductors like Fe2O3, BiVO4, BiFeO3, Bi2O3, etc [54,55,[106][107][108][109][110][111][112]. The wide band gap semiconductors operate as proper energy platform for accepting the HLEEs of these narrow bandgap semiconductors. As a result, the HLEEs are utilized in efficient photoreduction reactions in the CB platform of wide band gap semiconductors. Thus, the photocatalytic processes could be made practical by fabricating uncommon heterojunctions. This review aimed to provide a broad overview of the basic principles of photocatalysis, history, applications, shortcomings, activity enhancement strategies, synthesis, doping strategies and heterostructures formation of perovskite-type LaFeO3.</p>
<p>In this part, our goal is to present a clear description of the photocatalysis. In fact, photocatalysis has been regarded as one of the most advanced technique owing to its outstanding function in environmental clean-up such as self-cleaning of building supplies, anti-bacterial, anti-fogging, and exertion. The photo-catalysis applications are promptly increasing in various fields, and fundamental research work has been widely going at the forefront. In fact, the term "photocatalysis" is inspired by natural photosynthesis. In other words, photocatalysis is the acceleration of photoreactions with the aid of a catalyst. Particularly, the H2 fuel generation by H2O splitting with the aid of solar light (so called artificial photosynthesis) is extremely projected as a potential application. Several redox reactions occur on the heterogeneous photocatalysts surfaces via the photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, highly reactive species are produced via the reaction with photo-induced holes and electrons. These reactive species are mainly involved in the oxidative and reductive reactions. The species to which oxygen is highly reactive are called reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS mainly comprise superoxide-anion radical (•O2 -), hydroxyl-radical (•OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and singlet O2 ( 1 O2), as depicted in Fig. 1(a) [113]. These ROS facilitate pollutant oxidation. Besides, the h + could directly induce pollutant oxidation or under appropriate circumstances, react with the dissolved O2 or H2O/OH. On the other hand, the H + and CO2 are respectively reduced to H2 and hydrocarbons for favorable energy, while the H2O/OH -are transformed to •OH via oxidation reactions [114][115][116].</p>
<p>In the early 19 th century, the Giacomo Ciamician chemist firstly conducted experiments to investigate whether light initiates chemical reactions and performed experiments with blue and red lights [117]. He noticed that the chemical reaction occurred only with the assist of blue light. He carefully ruled out the choice that these reactions were driven by heat produced by light. The term "photocatalysis" firstly come into view in 1911 [118]. In 1924, the bleaching of Prussian-blue caused by ZnO upon exposure to light motivated scientists to utilize ZnO as a photocatalyst for the reduction of Ag + to the Ag under solar radiation [119].</p>
<p>Scientists investigated that the already existed photosensitive reactions did not involve light-sensitive catalysts [120]. In 1932, it was reported that the TiO2 and Nb2O5 catalysts could drive the photocatalytically reduction of AgNO3 to Ag and AuCl3 to Au [121]. Subsequently, in 1938, it was investigated that TiO2 can be used as a photo-sensitizer to bleach dyes in the presence of oxygen [122].</p>
<p>Afterwards, due to the lack of practical applications, interest in photocatalysis became a hobby. In 1973, the conditions changed because of the oil crisis that provoked researchers to search for alternative energy resources to fossil fuels [123].</p>
<p>Besides, the environmental concern due to the large-scale industrial set-up encouraged scientists to search for renewable energy resources [124]. The Bell's team first reported the evolution of O2 on TiO2 in 1968 [125]. Later in 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported the photoelectrochemical H2O oxidation on TiO2 electrodes under UV-light irradiations [126]. In 1977, researchers reported the photocatalytic H2O splitting on TiO2 that yielded H2 and O2 (2:1) under argon atmosphere [127]. In 1979, Inoue et al.</p>
<p>reported the photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a variety of inorganic semiconductors [128]. Afterwards, researchers devoted time for exploring the basic principles, search of new photocatalytic materials, improving photocatalytic performance and clarifying the reaction mechanisms. In the development of new photocatalytic materials, numerous visible-light and UV-light active semiconductors with high efficiencies than TiO2 have been investigated [86,129,130].</p>
<p>According to the first law of photochemistry, the light absorbed by a substance can induce photochemical reactions [131]. Thus, semiconductor photocatalysis is not an exemption to this rule, so photons with high enough energy than the bandgap of a semiconductor must be absorbed to induce a chemical change. This means that if spectrum of the light source does not match the semiconductor electronic structure, then the photons will lose without interacting with the solid material. Thus, choice of the light source seriously influences the energetic competence of the chemical process. Taking into consideration the solar energy as a perfect excitation source for environmental reasons, the search for photocatalysts with appropriate bandgaps is a key worry of research communities working on photocatalysis. Therefore, an optical phenomenon should be considered because it greatly affects the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier's process, which is the primary step in photocatalysis [132][133][134].</p>
<p>In terms of reaction mechanisms, semiconductor photocatalysis may be described by three major steps: (i) light absorption and charge carrier's generation, (ii) charge separation, and (iii) initiation of redox reactions at semiconductor surface. The schematic design of semiconductor photocatalysis is provided in Fig. 1(b). When a photocatalyst is irradiated with photon energy equals to or superior to its bandgap, charge carriers are generated, the excited electrons move from the VB to its CB while leaving holes in its VB. (i) The photogenerated electrons and holes transfer to the surface of semiconductor. (ii) Simultaneously, a large percentage of electrons excited to the CB recombine with the VB holes due to electrostatic force of interaction, resulting in reproductive heat. (iii) The electrons in the CB initiate reduction reactions and reduce acceptor species. (iv) On the other side, the VB holes oxidize the surface adsorbed donor species. (v) Because of the existence of surface-active states on semiconductors, surface recombination also occurs [135][136][137][138]. Thus, the photo-induced long-lived charge carriers on the surface of semiconductors probably commence various redox processes that mainly depend on the donor and acceptor features of the adsorbed active species.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has been considered as a prospective clean and sustainable energy fuel.</p>
<p>Since the 1 st publication on H2O splitting by Honda and Fujishima in 1967, [139] the photocatalytic H2O splitting reactions with the aid of solar light have been extensively used for the generation of H2 fuel. In order to facilitate H2O splitting reactions, following points must be considered; (i) The photons energy should be equals to, or superior than the bandgap energies of semiconductors to generate charge carriers; (ii) The CB and VB edge potentials of the photocatalysts should match the H2O reduction and oxidation potential values such as H + /H2 (0 V versus NHE) [130,[140][141][142] and O2/H2O (+1.23 V versus NHE) [26], respectively as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). For H2O oxidation/reduction reactions, exceptional consideration should be given to the choice of suitable photocatalysts. For example, when a photocatalyst is irradiated under solar light, charge carriers are produced which then transfer to the surface of photocatalyst. The electrons/holes on catalyst surface would reduce/oxidize the adsorbed species to generate H2 and O2, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1(d). The light absorption and charge migration steps strongly depend on the structural morphology and electronic structure of catalysts.</p>
<p>Further, high crystallinity of the photocatalysts has positive effect on their activities, however, the increase in crystallinity decreases the surface defects that acts as the charge carrier's recombination centers. The redox reactions are mainly influenced by the surface active-sites and energy of activation for H2 and O2 evolution [130,[143][144][145]. In order to supply extra activation energy, noble metal nanoparticles as co-catalysts are widely employed.</p>
<p>Due to the rapid utilization of non-renewable fossil energy fuels, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing day-by-day, and its control is a serious issue for research communities [37,146,147]. Mimicking the natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical-fuels is a forthcoming technology to overcome the energy crisis and greenhouse effect [148][149][150]. In artificial photosynthesis approach, CO2 is converted into hydrocarbon fuels via the aid of photocatalysts and solar energy [151][152][153]. The CO2 conversion is a complex and multi-electron transfer mechanism that produces various products like, formic acid (HCOOH), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), and methane (CH4). These products are formed at their respective redox potentials vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 7 (see Fig. 1(e)) [154][155][156][157]. In fact, it is difficult to convert CO2 at room temperature because of its highly stable chemical structure. There are some key factors that influence the CO2 conversion process.</p>
<p>The most important factors include the effective charge separation and band gap alignment of the photocatalysts. The kinetics of the electron transfer to CO2, the basicity of photocatalyst, and CO2 adsorption also influence this conversion reaction [158][159][160].</p>
<p>Because of the fast growth of human population and industrial development, a variety of toxic pollutants are discharged into the surroundings that not only raised severe environmental issues but also posed a risk to the sustainable growth of human race [111,161]. The presence of these hazardous pollutants even in low concentration posed serious threats to the living organisms, and their degradation is a big challenge for research communities. Semiconductor photocatalysis is considered as a promising technology to effectively degrade these pollutants into inorganic minerals, without generating secondary pollutants [30,112,[162][163][164].</p>
<p>However, the effective degradation of pollutants requires a suitable semiconductor photocatalyst with proper band gap and redox potentials. When a photocatalyst is exposed to light energy equals to, or superior to its energy band gap, charge carriers are generated. The charge carriers will transfer to the surface of photocatalyst and react with the adsorbed O2, H2O, and -OH species. As widely accepted, the reduction potential value of O2/O2 •-versus NHE is -0.046 V. On the other hand, the reported oxidation potentials values for -OH/•OH and H2O/•OH are 1.89 and 2.27 V versus the NHE, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 1(f) [153,[165][166][167]. If a semiconductor has proper band gap with its CB and VB potential values suitable for the creation of active species like O2 •-and •OH, then it would probably oxidize various pollutants into inorganic minerals like CO2 and H2O.</p>
<p>Materials whose crystal structure resembles calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO3), are called perovskite structures [169]. The perovskite got the name from a mineral discovered by Gustav Rose in the Ural Mountains of Russia in 1839 and finally named after L. A.</p>
<p>Perovski ((1792-1856), a Russian mineralogist) [170,171]. Generally, the structure of an ideal ABO3-perovskite is cubic with space group of Pm3m [172]. The ABO3 oxide has 'A' and 'B' site cations of different sizes, which are bonded to the O anion. In ABO3 perovskites, the 'A' site contains rare earth elements while 'B' site contains 3D transition metals as depicted in Fig. 2(a) [173]. The atomic sizes of A-site cations are always larger compared to that of the B-site cations. An ideal cubic structure has six fold coordinated 'B' cations, surrounded by an anion octahedron, and the twelve fold cuboctahedral coordinated 'A' cations. The BO6 octahedral units share their vertices to form the back bone of the crystal structure, and the site 'A' cations occupies the gaps between these units [174][175][176]. In 1926, the detail investigation on perovskite structure by Victor Goldschmidt led us to the perception of tolerance factor, calculated by taking into account the arrangement of cations and anions radii in the crystal lattice. Generally, the tolerance factor designate the materials stability, purely depending on the ionic size of cations and anions located at the A, B and X sites. The exchange or partial substitution of anions or cations in perovskite structures cause deformation in the cubic structure, leading to the diverse crystallographic arrangement. The perovskites properties mainly depend on the arrangement of atoms of various elements. Many phase transitions take place upon altering the arrangement of atoms that leads to the inspiring selection of optical, electrical and chemical properties. Owing to these flexible tailoring properties, researchers are now paying attention to the perovskite materials due to their diverse applications in optics, sensors, electronics, medicine and optoelectronics. Depending on their capability to occupy various anionic/cationic sites, perovskites exist in diverse structures like oxides, nitrides and sulfides [173,177]. In this review, we have mainly focused on the oxide of perovskite type lanthanum ferrite.</p>
<p>LaFeO3 orthoferrite belongs to the class of perovskite-type ABO3 oxides having an orthorhombic structure with Pbnm space groups, which is weakly ferromagnetic [178].</p>
<p>The Fe ions subsystem orders into a moderately tilted anti-ferromagnetic structure with anti-ferromagnetic moment 'G' and weak ferromagnetic moment 'F' [179]. Rare-earth ions gain magnetization 'm' due to interaction with the Fe subsystem [180]. Perovskite-type orthoferrites are mostly interesting because, in contrast to the characteristic scalar product, there is an antisymmetric exchange interaction occupying the vector cross product of adjacent spins. The orthoferrites show anti-ferromagnetic behavior in the absence of this interaction and weak ferromagnetic in its presence. An interesting feature of these materials is that they show a temperature-dependent transformation, in which the direction of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins and the direction of the net magnetization also rotate by 90° [181]. Among different orthoferrites, LaFeO3 received tremendous attention in recent decades owing to its highly stable structure, cheapness, abundance, and proper band gap ~ 2.0 eV [182,183]. The LaFeO3 structure can be seen as a distorted, corner-sharing network of FeO6 octahedra, where La cations occupy the gaps between the octahedra as depicted in Fig. 2(b). Unlike the cubic perovskite with a distinct oxygen site, the orthorhombic phase LaFeO3 exhibit two dissimilar oxygen sites, O1 and O2, as depicted in Fig. 2(c). Due to the unique physicochemical properties, LaFeO3 has been utilized in advanced technologies like solid-oxide fuel cells, catalysis, electro-magnetic materials and gas sensors. The physicochemical properties of LaFeO3 mainly depend on its particles size, morphology and structure, which are vigorously influenced by the synthesis progression [93]. In next section, we will discuss about the synthesis routes of LaFeO3. Reproduced with permission from ref. [173] Copyright 2021, Elsevier.

<p>In fact, a broad variety of synthesis routes exists for the fabrication of LaFeO3 nanostructures and their selection mainly depends on the need and ease of materials availability for various applications. In this section, we will discuss the most frequently used synthesis procedures for energy and environmental applications including hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol-gel, microwave-assisted, and sonochemical.</p>
<p>In hydrothermal method, the precursors are heated in an autoclave at elevated temperature and pressure with the aid of H2O as a solvent. Generally, the employed temperature in hydrothermal process is above 60 °C and below 400 °C that creates high pressure in the closed vessel and assists the solubility of the reactants. Hydrothermal approach is basically a crystallization route including the nucleation and crystal growth as the main steps. Owing to its easy operation, this technique is broadly used for the synthesis of various nanomaterials [186]. This method has a huge effect on the product because only temperature is the controlling parameter. LaFeO3 nanoparticles prepared via hydrothermal route have been widely used in photocatalysis for the purpose of H2O splitting and pollutant degradation [187][188][189]. As demonstrated in Fig. 3(a), the LaFeO3 prepared via hydrothermal route exhibited floral-like sheet morphology with high specific surface area of 90.25 m 2 •g -1 , which resulted in the enhanced visible light degradation of RhB and MB pollutants [190]. Thus, the controlled size and shaped synthesis of nanostructure LaFeO3 via hydrothermal route is a promising research area in the nanoscience and nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The solvothermal approach is similar to hydrothermal one, but the only difference is that a variety of non-aqueous solvents are used in this method. This method mainly depends on factors such as temperature, pressure, and solvent. In the solvothermal process, the rise in temperature directly influences the synthesis by remarkably decreasing the size of nanoparticles [191]. Kominami et al. [192] prepared LaFeO3 nanoparticles via solvothermal decomposition of lanthanum(III)-isopropoxide and iron(III)-butoxide mixture in toluene solvent. In order to achieve nanoparticles with controllable size and morphology, surfactants are frequently added during the reaction. During post treatment of solvothermal technique, the polar or non-polar solvents (ethanol/hexane) could be used for washing the oxide/fluorides, whereas, the non-polar solvents like toluene or hexane could be used for washing the chlorides and bromides.</p>
<p>Sol-gel technique is the commonly used method that produces highly pure nanomaterials by room temperature treatment. This method assumes colloidal with the solution and gel formation. Generally, metal alkoxides are employed as precursor materials that serve as monomers for polymerization followed by hydrolysis, condensation, and crosslinking to produce a gel. Sol-gel is an extensively used method for the preparation of ceramics and large surface area nanomaterials [193]. The sol-gel technique mainly depends on pH and temperature. There are abundant reports on the synthesis of LaFeO3 by sol-gel technique [194][195][196][197]. Tijare et al. [182] reported the fabrication of LaFeO3 nanoparticles via a solgel route that showed superior activity for H2 production under visible light irradiations with the aid of co-catalyst Pt. The LaFeO3 prepared via sol-gel method also exhibited high performance for water decomposition [198]. Rao et al. [199] fabricated LaFeO3 nanoparticles via sol-gel process. Fig. 3(b) reveals that LaFeO3 has irregularly patterns of spheres with dimension of 20 nm. The HRTEM micrograph (Fig. 3(c)) reveals lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (121) plane of orthorhombic phase. The multi-diffraction rings (Fig. 3(d)) reveals polycrystalline nature. The particles showed enhanced activity for diclofenac degradation. This technique has advantage over others, because it is used for preparation of LaFeO3 with superior phase-formation temperatures.</p>
<p>In this technique, microwave radiations are used for heating the reaction mixture, and nanomaterials are obtained. The accomplishment of elevated temperature and pressure by the microwave treatment improves the homogeneous mixing and rate of reaction [200].</p>
<p>Farhadi et al. [201] reported large surface area LaFeO3 nanoparticles synthesized via a microwave-assisted method. In another report, [202] LaFeO3 nanoparticles prepared via microwave-assisted method, which showed superior photocatalytic performance for methylene blue degradation. This method also made a considerable contribution in combination with other synthesis routes like hydrothermal, sol-gel, etc. For example, Kostyukhin et al. [203] reported the synthesis of highly crystalline LaFeO3 via a one-step hydrothermal microwave-assisted technique. As shown in Fig. 3(e), LaFeO3 obtained via a combined microwave-assisted sol-gel method showed enhanced photoactivity for methylene blue decolorization [204]. The microwave assisted technique come into view as a new synthesis method and greatly explored in the terms of organic/inorganic synthesis owing to the diverse benefits like quick reaction time, homogeneous microwaving, along with the green and proficient energy purpose [205]. Thus, these abundant features make it a suitable procedure for LaFeO3 synthesis.</p>
<p>This method involves an indirect contact between the metal oxides precursor and ultrasound wave via acoustic cavitation. The ultrasound wave produces bubbles in the reaction cell that oscillates with collecting ultrasonic-energy and grows in size. The extreme growth in size eventually leads to its implosive collapsing and releases the stored energy that enhances the development of nanomaterials. This is an ideal method because reactions occur at ambient temperature and pH is the key factor that influences the nanomaterials formation [206]. Mehdizadeh et al. [207] reported the fabrication of LaFeO3 via a sonochemical process that exhibited enhanced activity for pollutant degradation. The key advantage of this technique is achieving nanometric size fine particles of LaFeO3.</p>
<p>LaFeO3 has broad applications in photocatalysis, gas sensing, electrocatalysis, chemical sensing, electronic materials, magnetic materials, superconductors and solid oxide fuel cells as depicted in Fig. 4. The crystal structure of LaFeO3 has corner associated BO6 octahedral units and twelve coordinated A-site oxygen cations, placed in between the eight BO6 octahedral units, thereby resulting in a cubic lattice structure, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Depending on the ionic radii and electro-negativity of A-site and B-site cations, orientation of octahedral units takes place, giving rise to lower symmetry structures. The B-site cations have strong interaction with the oxygen anions, while, the A-site cations have comparatively weak interaction with oxygen. Depending on the cation types that occupy the crystal lattice sites, these interactions could be changed to produce various crystal geometries. Thus, diverse tilting degrees of the octahedral units give rise to various crystal fields, resulting in special optical and electronic properties [208]. This might either influence the band structure, photoluminescence, dielectric, and electronhole transportation behavior of LaFeO3. Hence, due to the distinctive crystal structure, high stability, non-toxicity, and cheapness, LaFeO3 has been regarded as a potential candidate in photocatalysis. It is potentially better than other oxide photocatalysts, owing to the comparative electronic properties such as electrons mobility, charge carriers separation, and photo-induced lifetimes, etc [190,209]. Regrettably, LaFeO3 still exhibits</p>
<p>The existing problems could be solved by various modification strategies as mentioned below; (i) The small surface area and large particle size problems could be solved by synthesizing controllable sized porous nanoparticles via template assisted methods. As we know, catalysis belongs to the class of surface reactions. Hence, the pores will provide more active sites and promote the transportation of substances. This will enhance the chances of photocatalytic reactions leading to the greatly improved photocatalytic activities; (ii) The crystallinity of nanoparticles mainly depends on the conditions of temperature and reaction time. In order to improve the degree of crystallization and size control, we need to control the reaction time, and subsequently the reaction temperature;</p>
<p>(iii) By introducing co-catalysts, the reactions between electrons and O2, holes and water could be promoted; (iv) Most probably, the limited optical absorption response of LaFeO3 could be solved by reducing its energy band gap via metal and non-metal doping. This will create new energy states for capturing electrons and holes. As a result, the visible light absorption will enhance leading to the promoted photocatalytic performance;</p>
<p>(v) The charge carrier's separation could be promoted via coupling other semiconductors with proper energy band gaps. The schematic for modification strategies is depicted in Fig. 5. It has been demonstrated that due to the more positive CB bottom energy level of LaFeO3, photo-induced electrons exhibit insufficient energy to initiate reduction processes. However, upon exposure to visible light, it can generate high-level energy electrons (HLEEs), which can be utilized for effective photocatalysis. It is clear that the HLEEs excited from the VB of narrow bandgap semiconductors upon exposure to visible light could move thermodynamically to the CB of wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2, and ZnO in the composites [104,105]. This will prolong the lifetime of photoinduced highly energetic electrons, which can be utilized for efficient photocatalysis.</p>
<p>The doping history can be traced back to 19 th century. In 1930, [210] Gudden observed that the conductivity of a semiconductor is because of the presence of a small quantity of impurity. In 1931, [211] Wilson applied the quantum mechanical conformity to semiconductors. Later on, some pioneering works on rectifiers put forward the idea of ptype and n-type doping [212]. In 1938, Davydov reported the first model of p-n junction and explained the significance of minority carriers [213]. The concept of "doping" first came into view in 1944, [214] when Woodyard experimentally developed a nonlinear circuit-device utilizing germanium (Ge). He incorporated minute controlled quantities of phosphorus (P), antimony (Sb), and arsenic (As) into "Ge" to enhance the electrical conductivity of the circuit-junctions. Later on, Shockley theoretically presented the foremost innovation named "junction transistor" in 1949. He postulated that the new device is advanced to that of the point contact-type device [215]. Nevertheless, the construction of junction-transistors was troubled by a serious issue i.e. the device need a thin-spaced back-to-back joined interlayer of two p-n junctions [216]. This problem was solved in 1950 by Spark and Teal, while working in Bell's team and constructed a grown junction transistor by double doping technique. In first step, they transformed the molten form of n-type Ge into p-type via the addition of a minute quantity of pure gallium (Ga).</p>
<p>In second step, they transformed the p-type Ge back to n-type via the addition of a minute quantity of Sb [217]. Consequently, two different kinds of dopants were simultaneously incorporated in Ge. Thus, the p-n junction can be viewed as co-doping p-type and n-type dopants into semiconductors at dissimilar locations. The most common strategy for improving the efficiency of semiconductor photocatalyts is to dope impurity so as to increase the photon capture efficiency in visible light region. Normally, doping creates intra band gap energy levels that absorb visible light and utilizes a wide range of solar spectrum in photocatalysis as shown in Fig. 6(a). Elemental doping in perovskite oxides typically affects their tunable band gaps and luminescence properties. Normally, A-and B-site doping in perovskite oxides slightly increases or decreases the band gaps depending on the size of the incorporated cations. In general, large size dopants will decrease their band gaps, while small size dopants will increase their band gaps. This is mainly due to the altering of bond lengths and bond angles [218]. Maity et al. [219] demonstrated that Pr doping remarkably decreased the band gap of LaFeO3 by generating new electronic states, and drastically improved the photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation due to the increased light absorption and enhanced charge separation. A similar trend was found in the case of rare earth metal cations like Eu 3+ , Gd 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Nd 3+ doped LaFeO3 [220]. This fashion could be clarified based on doping site preference. Several reports highlighted the effect of dopant types on the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>For instance, Zhong et al. [221] confirmed that the catalytic activity of ABO3 perovskites is mainly associated with B site metal ions. For the rare earth metal cations like Eu 3+ , Gd 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Nd 3+ doped perovskite oxides, [220] the ionic-radii of these metal-ions are quite larger compared to the ionic radii of Fe 3+ cation, as a result, they occupy B sites.</p>
<p>Hence, incorporation of these metal ions in LaFeO3 resulted in the crystal lattice distortion that leads to various defects and improved the absorption of dye molecules.</p>
<p>The photocatalytic performance for dye degradation was attributed to the combined effect of lattice distortion, surface-exposed active sites, surface defects, and a decrease in the crystallite size of LaFeO3 as a result of the doped metal ions. Similarly, other reports [222][223][224] about incorporation of Cu 2+ in LaFeO3 resulted in the improved light absorption and photocatalytic activity for pollutants degradation. Beside, metal doping, non-metal doping can also enhance the optical absorption behavior of LaFeO3 that leads to the enhanced visible-light activities. For instance, Wu et al. [102] reported boron-doped LaFeO3 photocatalysts that revealed enhanced activities for phenol degradation under visible light irradiations. The XRD patterns (Fig. 6(b)) of the photocatalysts exhibited high crystallinity and were indexed to the orthorhombic phase, which is highly favorable for photo-induced electron-hole pair's separation and activity enhancement. As can be seen from Fig. 6(c) inset, the optical absorption characteristics were remarkably changed with increasing the boron content. The TEM micrograph of boron-doped LaFeO3 photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)) revealed a hexagonal shape and the HRTEM micrograph (Fig.</p>
<p>clarified the interplanar (101) spacing of 0.38 nm. The photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation was drastically improved as revealed in Fig. 6(e), and a schematic reaction was proposed as shown in Fig. 6(f). Thus, it is concluded that elemental doping in LaFeO3 could play a vital role in enhancing the light absorption, thereby optimizing the photocatalytic performance.

<p>Some typical examples of the dopants incorporated LaFeO3 photocatalysts and their activities are provided in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1 Some typical examples of the dopants incorporated LaFeO3 photocatalysts. As LaFeO3 is coupled with semiconductors having diverse electronic and band structures, innovative electronic structural configuration are produced due to band bending, that originate potential differences in the hetero-junction areas. At once, an interfacial built-in electric field is created, which promote charge carrier separation and migration. Based on the VB and CB potential values, the LaFeO3 based heterojunctions can be categorized into four main kinds such as Type-I, Type-II, Z-scheme, and uncommon heterojunctions as depicted in Fig. 8. In Type-I system, the CB level of the semiconductor 1 locates above the CB level of the semiconductor 2, while the VB edge of the semiconductor 2 locate above the VB edge of the semiconductor 1. Thus, the charge carriers would migrate from semiconductor 1 to semiconductor 2. In such systems, usually the redox activities are very weak [114]. In Type-II heterojunctions, band gaps of the two coupled semiconductors form a staggered alignment, because the conduction and valence band potentials of one semiconductor are reasonably higher than the second semiconductor. As a result, following the early production of electron-hole pairs under the external stimulus, the charge carriers have a tendency to transfer towards opposite directions through interface, leading to spatial separation and subsequent built-in the electric-field [235]. A direct Z-scheme composite represents a feasible strategy for improving the photo-activity. Particularly, the direct Z-scheme structure is similar to the Type-II one, but its charge carriers transport mechanism is different. In a typical direct Zscheme system, the charge carriers transfer pathway resembles the letter "Z". In other words, due to the low reduction ability of the photo-excited electrons of semiconductor 2, they will recombine with the photo-excited holes of semiconductor 1, which has weak oxidation ability. Thus, the excited electrons in semiconductor 1 with high reduction ability, and the holes in VB of semiconductor 2 with high oxidation ability can be maintained. In this system, the redox ability of catalyst could be optimized [236]. In uncommon systems, the visible light excited high level energy electrons of narrow band gap semiconductors would transfer to highly negative CB of wide band gap semiconductors for reduction processes. Meanwhile, the VB holes of narrow band gap semiconductors would contribute to oxidation reactions [104]. In LaFeO3-based heterojunctions, LaFeO3 might be used as semiconductor number 1 or 2, depending on the band edges of the coupled semiconductors. In LaFeO3-based type-I heterojunction (Fig. 8(a)), the CB of LaFeO3 should be more negative and its VB should be positive compared to the CB and VB of the coupled semiconductors. Hence, the photo-induced electrons and holes of LaFeO3 would migrate to the CB and VB of the coupled photocatalysts for redox reactions, respectively. In LaFeO3-based Type-II heterostructures (Fig. 8(b)), the CB potential of semiconductor-1 should be more negative compared to the CB of semiconductor-2. Likewise, its VB edge should be less positive than the VB edge of semiconductor-2. Hence, under solar irradiations, band bending is produced at interfacial junction, and the electron and holes move in opposite directions. Type-II heterojunction is more beneficial due to the highly efficient charge carriers separation. In addition, the surface redox reactions occur in two different semiconductors. In Z-type heterostructures (Fig. 8(c)), the photo-induced electrons of the semiconductor-2 with less negative CB edge would combine with the holes of semiconductor-1 having less positive VB edge, leaving behind electrons in the highly negative edge CB of semiconductor-1 and holes in the highly positive VB edge of semiconductor-2. Thus, the wonderful Z-scheme heterojunction displays a dual function in catalysis such as better charge carriers separation and also strong reduction/oxidation ability owing to the highly negative CB edge and highly positive VB edge. LaFeO3-based uncommon heterojunction is very useful and can be utilized in various reduction reactions. In LaFeO3-based uncommon heterojunction, the semiconductor 1 could be excited under visible-light to produce charge carriers, while the semiconductor 2 (wide bandgap semiconductor i.e. TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc) can't be excited upon exposure to visible light as depicted in Fig. 8(d). In such kind of heterojunctions, the visible light excited HLEEs of LaFeO3 would move to the CB of wide band gap semiconductors for reduction reactions. In the meantime, the VB holes of LaFeO3 would participate in oxidation reactions. This will drastically improve the charge carriers separation efficiency, leading to the enhanced activities of LaFeO3. Summary of several most recent publications on LaFeO3-based heterostructures and their photocatalytic activity evaluation are shown in Table 2.</p>

<p>In LaFeO3-based type-I heterojunction, the CB of LaFeO3 should be more negative and its VB should be more positive than the CB and VB potentials of the coupled semiconductor. Thus, the photoinduced electrons and holes of LaFeO3 would respectively migrate to CB and VB of the coupled semiconductor. As a result, the reduction and oxidation reactions of the type-I composites will occur on the surface of a coupled semiconductor having low redox potentials. This significantly suppresses the redox ability of the fabricated type-I heterojunctions. For example, Soltanabadi et al. [243] reported CuO/LaFeO3 composites synthesized via a sol-gel route. The characteristic XRD peaks of CuO can be clearly observed in the CuO/LaFeO3 composites (see Fig. 9 fringes related to the MoS2 (0.62 nm) and LaFeO3 (0.28 nm). The photocatalytic activity of the composites was appraised by H2O reduction to evolve H2 under visible light. The H2 evolution activity of LaFeO3 was remarkably improved after coupling MoS2, and the optimized 1wt%MoS2/LaFeO3 composite produced 1132 mmol h -1 g -1 of H2 which is much greater than that produced by bare LaFeO3. This enhanced activity was due to the mesoporous nature and the improved charge separation in the composite. As suggested, the S-dangling bonds at the MoS2 surface were responsible for capturing the H2O molecules, which produced H + and OH -upon dissociation, and the H + ions then reduced to H2 by the interaction with CB electrons of MoS2 (see Fig. 9(f)). Thus, the charge separation and transfer mechanism extended the lifetime of photo-induced charges of the MoS2/LaFeO3 composite which resulted in the improved photocatalytic performance.

<p>The performance of LaFeO3 photocatalyst is severely influenced by the poor holes collection from body to the surface, although it has a suitable visible light absorption.</p>
<p>Specifically, the short diffusion-length of the holes in bulk LaFeO3 strictly limits its performance, because 'B' site cation (Fe 3+ ) decides the redox processes and electronic [237] Copyright 2020, Taylor &amp; Francis. TEM image (f), HRTEM image (g), and the schematic for charge transfer and separation and the photocatalytic processes over the CdS QDs/LaFeO3 composite (h). Adapted with permission from ref.

<p>It is highly preferred to investigate the suitable photocatalytic systems with adequate light absorption and proficient charge carrier's separation. Luckily, Z-scheme systems could solve majority of the problems related to the efficient photocatalysis to a certain degree, because Z-scheme systems not only acquire outstanding charge separation ability, but also maintain high redox ability of the electron-hole pairs. In Z-scheme systems, the photo-generated electrons of semiconductor 1 (with weak reduction power) facilitate direct recombination with the photo-generated holes of semiconductor 2 (with weak oxidizing power). Meanwhile, the photo-generated electrons of semiconductor 2 posses strong reduction ability, while the photo-generated holes of semiconductor 1 possess strong oxidation ability for efficient photocatalytic reactions [277]. Yet, the design of an appropriate low cost, environmental friendly and highly stable Z-scheme system for efficient visible light photocatalysis has attracted worldwide scientific attention. For instance, Xu et al. fabricated core-shell LaFeO3/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction via a facile method as depicted in Fig. 11(a). The TEM image (Fig. 11(b)) reveals the presence of g-C3N4 shell. The lattice fringes of LaFeO3 and the g-C3N4 shell can be clearly observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 11(c)). The charge transfer reveals a Z-scheme as shown in Fig. 11(d). Thus, the Z-scheme system has been proven to be an important strategy to improve the redox activity of heterostructures. Ye et al. [276] reported the process of fabricating g-C3N4/LaFeO3 Z-type heterojunction by simply calcination of Meanwhile, the induced VB holes of LaFeO3 and CB electrons of g-C3N4 participated in the photocatalytic processes. Thus, the g-C3N4/LaFeO3 nanocomposites exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to the single LaFeO3 and g-C3N4 components.</p>
<p>Among the LaFeO3-based Z-scheme heterojunctions, the dual Z-scheme exhibit higher activity than the normal Z-scheme systems. Zhang et al. [281] reported dual Z-scheme AgI/LaFeO3/g-C3N4 composite that was fabricated via an ultrasonic assisted C3N4/LaFeO3 composites.

<p>Fortunately, uncommon heterojunctions are more beneficial than the type-I, type-II, and Z-scheme heterojunctions because of the strong reduction and oxidation ability due to the drastically promoted charge separation. In our previous report, [278] we fabricated TiO2/porous LaFeO3 nanocomposites via a wet chemical route. The activities of the composites were appraised by acetaldehyde and phenol degradations under visible light irradiations (see Fig. 12(a)). It should be noted that the introduction of TiO2 greatly improved the activities of LaFeO3 for gas-phase acetaldehyde and liquid-phase phenol degradations and the highest activities were observed for the optimized 9wt%TiO2/LaFeO3 composite. The optimized sample produced highest amount of hydroxyl radical as shown in Fig. 12(b). Thus, it was confirmed that the enhanced photoactivity was due to the improved charge separation and transfer as described in Fig.</p>
<p>Recently our group [273] reported the synthesis of SnO2/yolk-shell LaFeO3 nanocomposites via a wet chemical method. In the SnO2/yolk-shell LaFeO3 nanocomposites, the SnO2 nanoparticles were used as photoelectron modulators. The yolk-shell structure could be observed from the TEM image (see Fig. 12(d)). The distinct lattice fringes of SnO2 and LaFeO3 could be observed from HRTEM image (see Fig. 12(l)). Thus, the newly designed uncommon heterojunction systems are more beneficial for various redox reactions. Though the activities of LaFeO3 were improved, however, the results were still not satisfactory for practical applications. Adapted with permission from ref.

<p>In order to achieve superior results, firstly we introduced pores in LaFeO3 via carbon nanospheres-template assisted route and then doped nitrogen into its crystal lattice [104]. Finally, we coupled TiO2 with the N-doped porous LaFeO3 using the wet-chemical technique.

<p>In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the research progress in the design, development, and application of perovskite-type LaFeO3 materials in the field of photocatalysis. First, we covered the history and basic principles of photocatalysis in terms of oxidation and reduction reactions, which was followed by the history, applications, shortcomings, and modification strategies such as the nanostructure synthesis, doping, and heterostructures formation, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of LaFeO3. The idea of uncommon heterojunctions was also discussed where the LaFeO3 produces charge carriers, upon exposure to visible light radiations. This idea of uncommon heterojunction is beyond the conventional type-I, type-II, and Z-scheme heterojunctions and much crucial for efficient photocatalysis. We proposed that the design of nanostructure can remarkably improve the surface area of LaFeO3 that can efficiently perform photocatalysis. In summary, the modification strategies such as nanostructuring, elemental doping, and heterojunctions formation can significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of LaFeO3, by increasing specific surface area, extending light absorption, suppressing charge carriers recombination, and efficient utilization of electrons.</p>
<p>The important points for future consideration are given below:</p>
<p>1. As for the small surface area and large particles size problems, the reaction time and reaction temperature should be controlled. Further, different templates such as carbon nanospheres and polystyrene spheres can be used and the control sized porous materials can be easily prepared.</p>
<p>2. In order to promote the adsorption of O2 onto the surface of photocatalysts, modification with inorganic acids is highly recommended.</p>
<p>3. Doping of metal and non-metal elements can be functional to promote light absorption and suppressing charge carriers recombination via the generated new energy states.</p>
<p>4. As for pollutant degradation reactions, the key step to promote the photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts is to enhance its charge carrier's separation. One common strategy that is widely employed is to fabricate type-II, Z-scheme and uncommon heterojunctions. This can remarkably improve the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts.</p>
