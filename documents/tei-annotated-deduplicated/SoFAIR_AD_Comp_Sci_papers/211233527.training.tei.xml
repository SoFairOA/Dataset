<p>This paper explores the usage of Blockchain Technology for land records management in India.</p>
<p>The paper highlights issues like minimal transparency, accountability, incoherent data sets with different Government Departments pertaining to the same piece of land and delays in the current Land Records Management process and how these problems can be overcome using Blockchain Technology. The paper describes the current process of land records maintenance and land registration in the country. The paper also discusses various challenges encountered during implementation of the Blockchain Technology like public key infrastructure and Internet, privacy rules and security issues. Finally, the paper illustrates system design using Blockchain Technology for implementation of Land Titling system in the country, so that land titles are tamper-proof and provides authentic and conclusive rights on ownership.</p>
<p>In India, Land records can be defined as a generic expression that may include records such as, the Records of Rights (RoRs), tenancy and crop inspection register, mutation register, disputed cases register, etc. Land Records also include geographical information of each parcel of land with its boundary, size, soil-type of the land; and economic information related to irrigation and crops (Bal. Meghana, 2017). Land Titling is a form of land reform in which individuals and families are given formal property rights for land which they have previously occupied informally, or used on the basis of customary land tenure.</p>
<p>The National Land Record Modernization Programme (NLRMP) was launched by Government of India in August 2008 with aim to develop a modern, comprehensive and transparent land records management system in the country which ensures guaranteed conclusive Land Titling of the immovable properties (http://dolr.nic.in). The programme was later revamped and reintroduced as Digital India-Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP) in the year 2014 to establish a modern and efficient land records management system in the country. This requires real time updated land records for maintenance of conclusive Land Titling system with title guarantee (Vinay et al, 2019).</p>
<p>Most of the States have successfully implemented the digitization of the existing Land Records and computerization of property registration offices. However, these computerized systems work in standalone mode and there is a lack of trustworthy eco-system for managing transactions and updating the records. The need of trusted and efficient ecosystem can be addressed by using Blockchain based system. In this paper, the issues related to implementation of a Blockchain based system for maintaining and integrating various sub systems like land records, registration, banks, survey, settlements and courts are described for implementation by the States. This study also tries to elicit a set of research objectives through the research questions like… 1. How the Blockchain solution shall be used in States?</p>
<p>2. Which PKI infrastructure should be used for digital identities of the individuals? 3. How to use the channels and design of the smart contacts for better control of the system? 4. Provision if any in IT Act or Government Regulations related to Blockchain in India? 5. Is there any guidelines for use of Aadhaar (12 digit Unique ID to Citizen) and Know Your Customer (KYC) in Blockchain? 6. What are the prerequisites to start the Blockchain implementation in States?</p>
<p>Land Record Management has gone through several reforms like Zamindari Abolition Act (confiscating land from land lords i.e. Zamindars), Land Ceiling Act (to redistribute surplus land to the landless), tribal ownership rights etc. after independence. The land is State subject hence the procedure of land records management differs from State to State. Records-of-Rights (RoR) are maintained in Tehsil/Mandal (sub-district administrative unit) office and are not updated frequently. As land records maintenance involves land related details, maps plan and land registration, the records maintenance is done by three State Departments/agencies i.e. Land Records Department, Survey Department and Registration Departments in the States. As each department works in its own standalone manner, records updated in one Department makes it outdated for the other Department. Transactions of land are recorded but the ownership titles remain presumptive. This gives scope for fraudulent transactions such as double sale, sale by non-owners, unknown buyers (benami), back-dated transactions and so on. About 40 percent of disputes in various courts are related to illegal encroachments, title disputes etc. Land/property can be transferred from one party to another through sale/purchase, land acquisition, inheritance, court orders, bank mortgage as detailed below.</p>
<p>In India, ownership updation mainly happens through sale transaction which is done through registration of deeds. The registration systems are generally classified into two major categories i.e. Deed registration and Title registration (Aggarwal, 2018). In 'Deed Registration', a written conveyance deed is executed between the parties and is registered at registrar office. This registered deed is the proof of transaction in the property and serves for the purpose of maintaining land records. The Transfer of Property Act 1882 gives the right to transfer or selling of an immovable property through registered document. One can get the transaction registered but land title is not guaranteed. The ownership is established through a registered sale deed and some other documents like property tax receipts, survey documents, RoR documents etc.</p>
<p>Whereas in 'Title Registration' the legal validity of the transaction is verified by the Registrar and the rights are transferred only if the grantor has clear title to transfer (Aggarwal, 2018).</p>
<p>The current process of Land Registration in India, after the implementation of Digital India Land Records Modernization program is outlined below and illustrated by Fig. 1.</p>
<p>• The buyer and seller finalize the 'Agreement to Sale' and get it notarized. Usually the buyer pays a token amount to the seller at the time of signing the deal.</p>
<p>• In case the buyer applies for any loan from any bank, the seller needs to obtain 'No Encumbrance Certificate' (evidence that the property in question is free from any monetary and legal liabilities) from the Land Registration Office and share the same with the buyer.</p>
<p>The bank sanctions the loan on the basis of buyers eligibility.</p>
<p>• The buyer pays the stamp duty to Treasuries &amp; Accounts Department either online or though bank deposits after raising the challan through eGRAS (Government Receipt Accounting System, as running in few States namely Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana, Jharkhand ).</p>
<p>• The final sale deed is drafted on stamp papers thus obtained. The full and final amount is paid by the buyer or his/her bank to the seller and the sale deed is signed by both the parties and two witnesses.</p>
<p>• The deed is registered at the Sub-Divisional Registrar Office (SRO). The SRO checks for identity and map of the property and registers the property. The original registered deed is collected by the buyer or his/her bank.</p>
<p>• The buyer now applies for mutation with required documents (such as affidavit, property tax receipt etc.) at the Patwari's land revenue office at the Taluka (Tehsil/ Block) level.</p>
<p>• The Patwari records the statement of both the parties and matches them with the submitted documents. The Partwari issues a proclamation by inviting objections.</p>
<p>• Mutation is granted if no objections are received. Otherwise, the case is transferred to the Revenue Assistant Officer for resolution.</p>
<p>Land Acquisition is another process wherein agricultural and/or non-agricultural lands are acquired by the Government for various developmental activities such as village/town extension, construction and/or development of roads, culverts, reservoirs, canals, military camps, railways and industries. The Land Acquisition Act 1894 governs the process of acquisition of land in public interest, which is a central act. The land privately owned and occupied by the citizens and non-governmental organizations are subjected to acquisition. The Land Records System helps in finding the land owners and types &amp; extent of land and Land Acquisition System helps in speedy land acquisition and settlement of the dues and disputes. After the notification of the land and acquisition of the land, the title and ownership gets updated in the respective land registers (known as Khasra and Khatoni in majority of States).</p>
<p>The ownership rights are also updated by Patwari/Talathi, revenue official at village level because of inheritance or death cases. The Patwari has the power to transfer land to the heirs within the prescribed time.</p>
<p>The updation of ownership right is also done through court orders. Further, when owner takes loan, the lending bank makes the entry in the land records database about the mortgage of the property against which loan is taken by the land/property owner. Though the transactions generated through land acquisition, inheritance, mortgage and court orders are not many, but needs to be recorded for keeping the system updated and complete.</p>
<p>• The existing land records available in the country are not clear, poorly administered and often do not reflect the ground reality. The maintenance and availability of information of land records are few of the critical challenges faced by the Government. The major factors behind such inadequate systems are their derivation from the ancient 'zamindari' system. Additionally, the current legal framework of India does not ensure guarantee of ownership. This information is updated and stored by different Departments at the district or village level. The data among these Departments is not synchronized regularly which creates discrepancies in the records and often the information on the documents mismatches with the ground position. The poor handling of the processes of land transaction and record keeping affects the management of land markets in the country (Aggarwal, 2018).</p>
<p>According to the Ease of Doing Business Survey 2017, by World Bank, India ranked at the 154 place in case of land/property registration. This index is based on the quality of land administration, transparency of information system, time and cost. In developing countries, land (5) Fraud and corruption. Some of these critical issues can be addressed by using emerging technologies such as Blockchain, which is briefly discussed in next section.</p>
<p>Blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger distributed across a network of computers called 'nodes' that keeps record of all the transactions that take place between peer to peer running the same protocol. This ledger runs over the internet and is cryptographically secure, append-only, As base records are already digitized and available in MIS, to the existing transactions can be migrated to Blockchain architecture as shown in Fig 3.</p>
<p>Land Records Maintenance and transfer of property using Blockchain would eliminate our dependency on the third parties involved in the verification process; thus, allowing us to have a greater degree of confidence in land titles and safer transactions. Adopting this new system of Blockchain in land records and registry, would bring real digital trust among the parties involved, as all the peers can make quick decisions if they have complete data regarding the land at the same time. The system would be transparent and integrated -because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. On demand access to records;</p>
<p>2. Transactions are grouped in blocks;</p>
<p>3. Each record is linked to previous one using cryptographic hash thus forming a chain of blocks;</p>
<p>4. Records are incorruptible, immutable and cannot be duplicated;</p>
<p>5. Have irrefutable unique digital signature;</p>
<p>6. Records once set chronologically cannot be changed in time;</p>
<p>7. Are decentralized and regulated without human discretion Fig. 3. Blockchain Architecture</p>
<p>Government of Republic of Georgia is the first Government to introduce Blockchain Technology Land Registry Management. The Georgians can register their lands and transact on the Blockchain for the same reducing the conflicts in registration processand property exchange (Dasgupta, 2017). The notary services for the ownership verification and proof of transaction is not required as such transactions are automatically added onto the digital ledger. The records of title are immutable on Blockchain and compared to paper records or digital database held on a secure cloud (Mukhopadhyay, 2018).</p>
<p>Recently, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has partnered with a Sweden based company Chromaway to build its Blockchain-based solution for land registry. The multiple Ethereum nodes (in case of Andhra Pradesh Blockchain land registry) will allow property deeds to be stored on a Government Land Registry (Mukhopadhyay, 2018). The solution would facilitate asset ownership transfer from property seller to buyer, approved via Land Department, and demonstrates possible integration with other Government entities like State Municipal Department and Water Department.</p>
<p>The data flow between various entities in land registry process are shown in Fig. 5. The approach for applying the Blockchain Technology to land registration system in India has been discussed</p>
<p>in the following section. The records are shown in blue color in the centre. The traditional processes are shown in the outer ring. All the nodes (Bank, Notaries/Court, Survey, SRO, Tehsil) are part of the Blockchain. The nodes are distributed across a widespread network and carry the tasks assigned.</p>
<p>The nodes in the proposed Blockchain are shown below.</p>
<p>Node 1: Bank (Mortgage/Loan, Buyer, Owner)</p>
<p>The banks are the key institutions of financial lending and carrying out the financial transactions between the buyer and seller. The Tehsil office is the basic unit of the land records system where all records and maintain and updation are carried out. All the basic land records and registers are also maintained at this office. This also acts as front office for various citizen services. Below Tehsil Office, Village</p>
<p>Level functionaries (Patwaries) keeps updating the land records for each village on regular basis.</p>
<p>A node can either be a communication endpoint or a point of communication redistribution, linking to other nodes. Every node on the network is considered equal, however each nodes have different roles in the manner in which they support the network. For example, not all nodes will store a full copy of the Blockchain or validate transactions (Lisk Academy, 2019). However, all involved nodes listed above would have access to the full copy of the Blockchain.</p>
<p>The process flow of maintenance of land records during registration using Blockchain Technology is explained below:</p>
<p>• The buyer goes through the official 'Land Management Information' portal of the State where he identifies and select one among the listed lands/properties as per his/her requirement.</p>
<p>• Both buyer and seller negotiate and agree on the terms and conditions of the purchase. Once the deal is initiated, the transaction is made public through the council of administrators (nodes) who independently holds identical copy of the transactions. A consensus is generated with the involved nodes and transaction is approved. As a result of the transaction, block is added to the ledger.</p>
<p>• The buyer now applies for property loan from a respective Bank which is also one of the administrative nodes. The bank ensures due diligence in its process. Only after the complete authentication, it approves the proposed loan and offers approval letter to the buyer. The copy of the offer letter is issued to buyer and a transaction is validated by the nodes involved.</p>
<p>As a result, a block is added to the ledger again. (Node -1)</p>
<p>• The buyer calculates the stamp duty using e-stamp calculator and pays the stamp duty via eStamping system of Stockholding Corporation of India Ltd. The transaction is validated by consensus of the nodes and a new block of data is added to the ledger. (Node-2)</p>
<p>• Buyer gets the deed drafted and electronically signed by self, the seller as well as two witnesses. The signed deed is submitted to the Sub Registrar Office and registration fee is paid online. The concerned authority puts up the receipt of registration fee and copy of submitted deed on the network for approval. The majority of the nodes approve and a block is added to the Blockchain (Node -4).</p>
<p>• Sub Registrar office (SRO) verifies all the submitted documents including map plans and ID proofs. Once done, the SRO issues the registered deed to the buyer/bank. The issued deed is approved by the consensus and a block is added for this transaction (Node-4).</p>
<p>• The buyer applies for mutation at the Tehsil office. The application is put up by the authority for approval of the nodes. A block is added to the ledger indicating the authenticated transaction. (Node -5)</p>
<p>•
<rs xml:id="12966125" type="software">Tehsildar</rs> verifies all the records and property maps. A preview of changed map on the Management Information portal is generated which can be viewed by all the participating nodes including 'Buyer' and 'Seller'. Network of nodes validate the transaction for the approval of mutation. A block is added to the ledger (Node-3).
</p>
<p>• The Revenue Office / Municipality issues proclamations inviting objections through newspapers and digital platform. Network of nodes validates the documents regarding proclamations and approve to publish them. As verification is completed, a new block of data is created for ledger (Node-5).</p>
<p>• If Department receives no objections, the revenue office/Tehsil office/municipality puts up documents to get the approval from the nodes before sanctioning the mutation. And if there are objections regarding proclamations, the municipality transfers the issue to the Revenue Assistant Officer and later to the Deputy Commissioner (if any of the party is aggrieved).</p>
<p>The orders regarding proclamations are put up for approval by the concerned nodes. The approved transactions led to the generation of a new block to the ledger (Node-5).</p>
<p>• After the objections are solved, the municipality sanctions the mutation and the order is put up for approval from the concerned nodes. The consensus is generatedand a new block is added (Node-5).</p>
<p>• The addition of new block transfer the message to the Tehsil office to permanently update the land records database and all land records are updated and stored. (Node -3).</p>
<p>Any particular property has few elements like khatano (owner account number), khata owner (owner name), owner's father, address, khasrano (parcel ID), total area, buyer, buyer father and area to buy. So new class is being created known as addNewProperty. When the property is registered for the first time in its records is pushed into the block with hash. Next,when the owner sells his property then, it takes the details of the buyer and how much (area) he/she wants to buy. The same information is stored it with current hash along with the previous hash. If iii) Its immutable nature makes it hard to modify anything at later stage: The immutable nature of transactions in Blockchain Technology makes a fear in the minds of the employees and they (revenue functionaries) tend to continue with the existing computerized systems rather than adopting the new technology.</p>
<p>iv) There would be an issue of key management especially in private Blockchain: The Government PKI infrastructure and eSign mechanism (http://cca.gov.in) is not associated in key management in case of public Blockchain implementations yet. In case of private Blockchain there is no guidelines, till now regarding the usage of keys or key management from Government of India. There are instances of closure of the existing PKI infrastructures because of cyber attacks and security lapses.</p>
<p>v) There are no regulatory standards that govern application across jurisdiction. There are no regulations on how the transactions should be written: The minimum set of attributes required for recording a transaction is not fixed by any regulatory body in India. So for a implementation of a Blockchain Technology there should be identified, minimum set of attributes by a implementor State for each sectors. Decisions like the number of Blockchains that can be maintained needs to finalized by an approving or recommending organization. May be theme wise Blockchains can be maintained. In present land records maintenance eco-system we are maintaining single Blockchain for all the transactions. The infrastructure requirements get increased in case there is a need to maintain number of Blockchains based on themes.</p>
<p>vi) The open source consortium organizations have their own standards and codes they follow:</p>
<p>The open source implementation of Blockchain has their own consortium and there were many instances of security violations.</p>
<p>vii) The initial cost of set up of massive network for the implementation of Blockchain requires high initial cost: The establishments of a network with required bandwidth to maintain the nodes is a big task. In India the network availability is still very low. Further, the databases for land records are still maintained at District Levels/Taluk levels in many States. The updation of land records data is still carried out in the Taluk level officers where the Tehsildar is the custodian of the basic registers.</p>
<p>viii) A successful Blockchain network that consists of huge records of ledger may suffer from latency issues: The need of network and the interactions of the nodes with the traditional database servers are required for the complete knowledge about the transactions and the various entities associated with the transactions. There is a need of high-end servers not only to cater to the exiting load but also the extra connections required for replication of the transactions to all the participating nodes. Further the layout nodes and its efficient implementations are yet to be explored and become difficult in case of non-availability of implementations. For example, in private Blockchain implementations, one can create multiple channels to facilitate a group of nodes and isolate them from the others to meet the business requirements. The multiple channels have to be incorporated with multiple smart contracts. The judicious use of business rules and smart contracts are highly essential for a successful implementation of the Blockchain.</p>
<p>In order to overcome these issues, the Government of India, has initiated installation of special technology excellence centers, i.e. Centre of Excellence (COE) with requisite manpower and resources. Further these centres have collaboration with various technology institutes like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)'s and National Institute of Technologies (NIT's). The Government of India (GoI) has also started funding Blockchain projects to various startups. The GoI has also started strengthening the PKI infrastructure and public network enhancements with help of industry.</p>
<p>How How to use the channels and design the smart contacts for better control of the system? The channels help in providing privacy between different ledgers. The channels can be designed to private Blockchain approach should also be decided based on the anonymity of the validators.</p>
<p>In India, maintenance of land records and it's regular updation has been a challenging task. The citizens even lack confidence in the existing systems prevalent in the States. Citizens are unsure if they legally own a piece of land, even if they have a legitimate sale deed. Others who want to buy a piece of land are not sure if the seller legally owns it. In a situation like Kerala, where the flood destroyed paper records, Blockchain Solutions could have taken up as an alternative.</p>
<p>The Blockchain Technology gives us chance to fix many of these problems and provides cascading benefits. The solutions suggested in this paper incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as: an immutable history of transactional records, so no one can ever doubt the authenticity; records are permanently linked to the system so no one can ever tamper with or forge a record of their own; and these records can be seen by any party, at any time. It is powerful and validating.</p>
<p>The introduction of Blockchain Technology for land ownership and land registration process will bring clarity in ownership, valuation and reduce fraudulent transactions. This will also lead to better land management and conveyancing and enhance the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. Blockchain Technology will also facilitate achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Hughes et al. 2019). The correct and secured land records will strengthen the SDG goals including Peace Justice and strong institutions, as institutions will be effective and more accountable as the land transactions will be non-repudiable and open to all.</p>
<p>The paper suggests leveraging the inherent benefits of the Blockchain, with a focus on smart contracts. The system will capture and permanently record each transaction done either through sale of a property, inheritance, court orders, land acquisition etc. This means you achieve near real-time updated records with accurate traceability and transparency into the state of the property records. This will create a single source of truth of ownership status and history of a property transaction. The buyer will be assured that the land being bought is the correct plot, and that the seller is unequivocally the owner, reducing the potential of forgery and disputes, as well as the costs and time involved, for any given transaction and paving way to implement conclusive Land Titling system with title guarantee in the country.</p>
<p>The information related to land records, registration and surveying is maintained at different levels like Tehsils and Blocks. All the data is not available centrally, rather it is maintained in isolation at different levels. Further, the boundary updation of land parcels are still not updated</p>
<p>without involving any third party like banks in between. The decentralized distributed structures make it possible to distribute trust among all the nodes involved in the transaction. All nodes download and store the copy of each single transaction made in the network. The 'proof of work' algorithm makes the complete process secured and hence tampering and hacking is less likely to be occurred. Contracts can be encoded on any Blockchain, but Ethereum is most favored as it gives unlimited processing capability. In Ethereum Blockchain, we can store transaction along with smart contracts (code snippets) in the blocks</p>

<p>What are the prerequisites to start the Blockchain Implementation in States?: First, the respective State has to ensure that all data related to basic systems like land records, cadastral mapping, Office of the Registrar and other stockholders, if any, should be consolidated at a Data Centre at an appropriate hierarchy (like Dist / Sub Dist) and available in digital formats. The respective State should also identify organizations and Departments from whom support can be availed for a solid public key infrastructure and certifying authority services. The decision of public or</p>
<p>Since the data is maintained at different Departments business process engineering is required for each State to have a standard operating procedure. But land being a State subject in our legislation, the State has the exclusive power on this subject. Government of India should make standard operating procedures for implementation of Blockchain based systems applicable to all the States.</p>
<p>The current process of designing of a Blockchain system is based on the subject or context.</p>
<p>There is no generic and uniform design of Blockchain available. The research should be carried out in these directions. The load on the Blockchain system will gradually increase and the transactions will increase because of population growth. The legal requirements to meet the need of any disputes in case of the Blockchain Implementation also need to be notified by the Government. In future it is also very essential to integrate the Blockchain Technology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) for making the complete land management eco-system safer, faster, transparent and responsive.</p>
