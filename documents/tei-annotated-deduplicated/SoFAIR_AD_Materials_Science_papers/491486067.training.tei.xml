<p>Plastic accumulating in the environment, especially microplastics (defined as particles &lt;5 mm), can lead to a range of problems and potential loss of ecosystem services. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable plastics used in the manufacture of mulch films, and packaging as an alternative to minimize plastic residue accumulation and reduce soil pollution. Little is known, however, about the effect of microbioplastics on soil-plant interactions, especially soil microbial community structure and functioning in agroecosystems. For the first time, we combined zymography (to localize enzyme activity hotspots) with substrate-induced growth respiration to investigate the effect of PHA addition on soil microbial community structure, growth, and exoenzyme kinetics in the microplastisphere (i.e. interface between soil and microplastic particles) compared to the rhizosphere and bulk soil. We used the common PHA biopolymer, poly</p>
<p>(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) to show that PHBV was readily used by the microbial community as a source of carbon (C) resulting in an increased specific microbial growth rate and a more active microbial biomass in the microplastisphere in comparison to the bulk soil. Higher β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase activities (0.6-5.0 times higher Vmax) and lower enzyme affinities</p>
<p>(1.5-2.0 times higher Km) were also detected in the microplastisphere relative to the rhizosphere. Furthermore, the PHBV addition changed the soil bacterial community at different taxonomical levels and increased the alpha diversity, as well as the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia phyla, compared to the untreated soils. Overall, PHBV addition created soil hotspots where C and nutrient turnover is greatly enhanced, mainly driven by the accelerated microbial biomass and activity. In conclusion, microbioplastics have the potential to alter soil ecological functioning and</p>
<p>Synthetic polymers are widely used in our daily lives (Wright and Kelly, 2017), and more than 280 million tons of plastics are produced annually (Duis and Coors, 2016;Sintim and Flury, 2017). Despite the remarkable benefit of plastics to society, there are increasing concerns associated with the vast amount of plastic entering our environment and its subsequent resistance to degradation (Rochman, 2018). These concerns are supported by estimates that &gt; 30% of the world's plastic waste is disposed of inappropriately, with most ultimately entering the soil ecosystem (Jambeck et al., 2015;Weithmann et al., 2018). In soils, larger plastic debris often becomes fragmented by biota and physical disturbance into smaller pieces known as microplastics (mean diameter &lt; 5 mm), which have received increased attention</p>
<p>globally, due to their potential to cause environmental damage (Rillig, 2012;Wright and Kelly, 2017;de Souza Machado et al., 2019). A promising approach to overcome the accumulation of microplastics in soils is to replace traditional petroleum-based plastics with biodegradable bioplastics like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs; Gross and Kalra, 2002;Volova et al., 2017). PHAs account for 5.6% of the global production capacity for biodegradable polymers, and represent the second fastest growing group in the market sector since 2014 (Haider et al., 2019). Even though PHAs are used in an attempt to decrease microplastic residues in terrestrial ecosystems, and praised as promising alternatives for a diverse range of applications (e.g., mulch films for agriculture), the potential environmental consequences of PHAs have not yet been thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>Unlike petroleum-based microplastics, which biodegrade extremely slowly, PHAs can be broken down by a range of organisms and are not thought to produce any harmful by-products (Volova et al., 2017;Haider et al., 2019;Sander et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Their biological source also means that they are viewed as C neutral (Garrison et al., 2016), although this assumes that they don't induce positive priming of soil organic matter (SOM). Furthermore, they are supposed to not enhance N2O and CH4 release which might offset these benefits. Given that PHAs are C-rich but nutrient-poor (i.e.</p>
<p>no N and P; Gross and Kalra, 2002;Volova et al., 2017), they may alter microbial community composition and functioning during degradation. Since the decomposition of C-rich residues is associated with N and P immobilization, subsequent plant growth may also be affected due to the increased competition between plants and soil microorganisms for nutrients (Qi et al., 2018;Qi et al., 2020b;Song et al., 2020;Zang et al., 2020). In response to the additional C supplied from PHAs breakdown, the turnover of native SOM may be stimulated due to the altered metabolic status of the microbial community (Kuzyakov, 2010;Zang et al., 2017), and thus influence soil C and nutrient cycling. PHAs are also naturally present in soil being produced as storage compounds by the bacterial community (Mason-Jones et. al. 2019). Given that bacteria are more sensitive to environmental changes (e.g. increased labile C) compared to fungi (Barnard et al., 2012), soil bacteria may have a stronger response due to the increased C availability through PHAs breakdown. This will lead to significant long-term impacts on a range of soil ecosystem services (e.g., C storage, nutrient cycling, and pollutant attenuation; Zang et al., 2018). Although recent studies revealed that microplastics may have divergent influences on soil microbial communities and enzyme activities, e.g., activation (Liu et al., 2017;de Souza Machado et al., 2019), suppression (Fei et al., 2020), or remaining unchanged (Zang et al., 2020), the effect of microbioplastics on soil microorganisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, it is vital to investigate how biodegradable microplastics affect microbial functions and below-ground C processes (Zang et al., 2019(Zang et al., , 2020;;Qi et al., 2020a).</p>
<p>Similar to plant-soil interactions in the rhizosphere, the main processes affected by microplastic input may occur at the soil-plastic interface (here defined as the microplastisphere). We hypothesize that these interactions are stimulated by the input of labile C present in microbioplastics (i.e. increased microbial activity, attract or favor specific bacterial taxa, and interfere with belowground plant-microorganisms interactions) leading to the formation of microbial hotspots in soil, similar to those seen in the rhizosphere (Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya, 2015;Zang et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2020b). Following PHAs addition, we predict that changes in soil physico-chemical properties will only occur close to the microplastic particles, with changes in the bulk soil (non-hotspot) likely to be minor (Zettler et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2019). The specific niches of the microorganisms in the microplastisphere are of ecological relevance, given that most agricultural soils are contaminated by microplastics (Steinmetz et al., 2016;Qi et al., 2020a). However, it still remains unclear how PHAs affect soil microbial communities in hotspots and, thus, alters soil C and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time, we coupled zymography, a method to accurately locate microbial hotspots (Hoang et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020), the kinetics of exoenzyme activities involved in C, N, and P cycling, microbial growth, and bacterial community structure to evaluate microbial functions, as well as soil process in hotspots (rhizosphere and microplastisphere) and bulk soil. Poly</p>
<p>(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) represents a commercially available copolymer used for mulch film production. Compared to PHB, it has higher flexibility, thermal stability, and processibility due to the monomeric composition, which makes it promising as a typical example of PHAs (Table. S1; Jiang et al., 2009;Bugnicourt et al., 2014). Therefore, we aimed to 1) identify microbial hotspots in situ in soil treated with PHBV; 2) investigate the effect of biodegradable microplastics on microbial growth and enzyme kinetics; 3) evaluate changes in bacterial community structure and function in the microplastisphere and rhizosphere. We hypothesized that:</p>
<p>1) the labile C in PHBV will greatly alter soil bacterial community structure and functioning compared to the rhizosphere and bulk soil, and 2) the microplastisphere contains microorganisms with a high growth rate and enzyme activity in comparison to rhizosphere and bulk soil.</p>
<p>Soil samples were taken from the Ap horizon (0-20 cm) of an experimental field at the Reinshof Research Station of the Georg-August University of Göttingen, Germany (28°33'26"N, 113°20'8"E). This experimental site was established more than 40 years ago and the farming history is clear. No plastic mulch was applied, and no plastic pollution was recorded for the site. The soil was air-dried, sieved (&lt;2 mm), and mixed to achieve a high degree of homogeneity and to reduce the variability among replicates. Fine roots and visible plant residues were carefully removed prior to use. The soil contained 1.3% total C, 0.14% total N, and had a pH of 6.8 (Zhou et al., 2020b). Ten percent (w/w) of the soil dry weight was added as poly</p>
<p>PHBV was obtained in a pelletized form from the Tianan Biologic Materials Company Ltd., Beilun, Ningbo,</p>
<p>China. PHBV represents one of the most widespread and best characterized members of the PHA family (Bugnicourt et al., 2014). It is a 100% biobased thermoplastic linear aliphatic (co-)polyester obtained from the copolymerization of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxypentanoic acid which are produced through the bacterial fermentation of sugars and lipids (Zinn et al., 2001). Most of the PHBV is composed of hydroxybutyrate, however, a small fraction of hydroxyvalerate is present in its polymeric backbone (Rivera-Briso and Serrano-Aroca, 2018). This type and amount of highly crystalline plastic were chosen to simulate the localized disposal of bioplastics in agricultural soils (e.g., ploughing in of mulch film residues at the end of the field season) and was based on field investigations and a review of the literature (Fuller and Gautam, 2016;Qi et al., 2020a). We added very high amounts of microplastic to reflect soil hotspots with higher contamination levels (1-20%).</p>
<p>A mesocosm experiment with a completely randomized design and four replicates was set up in a climate-controlled room. For the PHBV addition treatment, 400 g soil and PHBV were mixed homogeneously and then placed in a rhizobox (10 × 10 × 4 cm; Qiangsheng Co., Ltd. Heibei, China). The control treatment contained soil (400 g) without PHBV, but with a comparable soil disturbance. The soil bulk density was maintained at 1.2 g cm -3 for all rhizoboxes. Prior to use, the soil was pre-incubated under field-moist (25% v/v) conditions in a greenhouse for one week to allow the soil to equilibrate. Before planting, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds were sterilized in 10% H2O2 for 10 min, then rinsed with deionized water and germinated on wet filter paper. Five days after germination, seedlings were transplanted in rhizoboxes (one seedling per rhizobox), and then moved to the climate-controlled chamber (day/night regime of 14 h/24 °C and 10 h/14 °C, respectively). The relative humidity in the chamber was maintained at 40% and the plants were received 800 μmol m -2 s -1 photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) at canopy height (Zhou et al., 2020b). Plants were watered every three days and the soil moisture was maintained at a gravimetric moisture content of 25% throughout the experiment by weighing the rhizoboxes.</p>
<p>At 24 days after transplanting, zymography was used to visualize three hydrolytic enzymes Razavi et al. 2016). Given that β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, and leucine-aminopeptidase play a corresponding major role in cellulose, organic phosphate, and protein degradation (Lopez-Hernandez et al., 1993;Lammirato et al., 2010), there reflects key enzymes related to soil C, P and N cycle, respectively (German et al., 2011). Polyamide membrane (Tao yuan, China) were saturated with 4-methylumbelliferyl (MUF) and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) based substrate to visualize the specific enzymes. Each substrate was separately dissolved in 10 mM MES and TRIZMA buffer for MUF and AMC, respectively. The saturated membranes were placed on soil surfaces containing root systems and covered with aluminum foil to avoid water evaporation and moisture changes during the incubation period (Hoang et al., 2020). After incubation for 1 h, the membrane were carefully lifted off the soil surface and any attached soil particles were gently removed with tweezers and a soft brush (Razavi et al., 2016). Enzyme detection sequences followed as: β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, leucine-aminopeptidase activity, with 1 h interval after each zymography. The grey scale values transferred to the enzyme activities was calibrated using membranes (2 × 2 cm) saturated with a range of concentrations of corresponding products, i.e. MUF and AMC (0. 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 mM).</p>
<p>The zymograms were transferred into a 16-bit gray scale by
<rs xml:id="12967785" type="software">ImageJ</rs> with a correction for environmental variations and camera noise (Razavi et al., 2016). The calibration line obtained for each enzyme was used to convert gray values of each zymography pixel into enzyme activities (Hoang et al., 2020). Enzyme activities exceeding 25% of mean corresponding activity of the whole soil were defined as hotspots (Zhang et al., 2020). Specifically, soil with a high color intensity (dark-red)
</p>
<p>represents microbial hotspots, whilst dark-blue colors indicate bulk soil on the zymograms (Fig. 1; Hoang et al., 2020). Given the hotspots in the control and PHBV-treated soil were detected at the distance within 1.5-2 mm from the roots and microplastics, the hotspots in the control and PHBV-treated soil were identical as the rhizosphere and microplastisphere zones, respectively (Fig. 1). After collecting soil from hotspots and bulk soil, a total of 16 samples [2 treatments (without and with PHBV)×2 microsites from each treatment (hotspots and bulk soil)×4 replicates] were obtained.</p>
<p>At 25 days after transplanting, the shoots were cut off at the base of the stem and the roots were collected separately. For precise localized sampling, soil particles were carefully collected using needles (tip 1.5 mm) directly from the hotspots (rhizosphere and microplastisphere) identified by zymography (Fig. 1). Bulk soil was collected in a similar way. Once collected, soil samples (hotspots and bulk soil) were separated into two sub-samples. One sub-sample was stored at -80 °C to analyze the bacterial community structure, while another sub-sample was used to measure enzyme kinetics and the kinetics of substrate-induced growth respiration directly. After removal of the hotspot samples and bulk soil, the remaining soil in the rhizobox was mixed and then stored at 4 °C to measure microbial biomass N, dissolved organic C and N. Shoots and roots were oven-dried (60 °C, 5 days) and then weighed.</p>
<p>Soil microbial biomass N (MBN) was extracted with K2SO4 (32 mL, 0.05 M), and calculated with a corresponding KEN factor of 0.45 according to Wen et al. (2020).</p>
<p>Briefly, the fresh soil was homogenized and 8 g sub-sample of the soil was extracted with K2SO4 (32 mL, 0.05 M). Another 8 g sub-sample of the soil was fumigated with chloroform for 24 h and then extracted in the same way. Total C in extracts was measured using a 2100 TOC/TIC analyzer (Analytik Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany).</p>
<p>The non-fumigated extractions were used as a measure for dissolved organic C (DOC)</p>
<p>and N (DON).</p>
<p>The activity of the exoenzymes β-1,4-glucosidase (BG) (EC 2.2.1.21), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) (EC 3.4.11.1), and acid phosphatase (ACP) (EC 3.1.3.2) were determined by the 4-methylumbelliferyl (MUF)-based and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-based artificial substrates (Marx et al., 2001;Wen et al., 2019). Briefly, 0.5 g soil was mixed with 50 ml sterile water and then shaking for 30 min. After 2 min low-energy sonication (40 J s -1 ) by ultrasonic disaggregation, 50 µl of the soil suspension, 50 μl of corresponding buffer (MES or TRIZMA) and 100 μl of the corresponding substrates at concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 μmol l -1 were pipetted into 96-well black microplates (Brand ® plates pureGrade, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The Victor 1420-050 Multi label Counter (Perkin Elmer, USA) was used to measure the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Enzyme activities were taken at 4 times (0, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h), and was expressed as nmol g -1 soil h -1 .</p>
<p>To calculate key parameters describing the enzyme kinetics, we fitted a Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data (Marx et al., 2001):</p>
<p>where V is the enzymatically mediated rate of reaction, Vmax is the maximal rate of reaction, Km (Michaelis constant) is the substrate concentration at ½Vmax and S is substrate concentration. The substrate turnover time (Tt) was calculated according to the following equation: Tt (hours) = (Km + S) / Vmax, where S is the substrate concentration (200 μmol l -1 ). The catalytic efficiency of enzymes (Ka) was calculated by the ratio of Vmax and Km (Hoang et al., 2020). The microbial metabolic limitation was quantified by calculating the vector lengths and angles of enzymatic activity for all data based on untransformed proportional activities (e.g. (BG):(BG+LAP), (BG):(BG+ACP)) (Moorhead et al., 2016).</p>
<p>The substrate-induced growth respiration (SIGR) approach was used to distinguish total and active biomass fractions, as well as microbial specific growth rate and lag-time before growth (Zhang et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020a). It should be noted that although C substrate addition is required for the SIGR approach, all kinetic parameters analyzed by SIGR represent the intrinsic features of dominating microbial populations before substrate addition (Blagodatsky et al., 2000).</p>
<p>One gram of fresh soil was amended with a mixture containing 10 mg g -1 glucose, 1.9 mg g -1 (NH4)2SO4, 2.25 mg g -1 K2HPO4, and 3.8 mg g -1 MgSO4 . 7H2O, and placed in a Rapid Automated Bacterial Impedance Technique bioanalyzer (RABIT; Microbiology International Ltd, Frederick, MD, USA), for measuring CO2 production at room temperature (22 °C). Firstly, we pre-incubated 16 samples from hotspots and bulk soil with and without PHBV amendment for 2 days at 45% water holding capacity (WHC) to minimize the effect of sampling disturbance. To measure substrate-induced respiration, a mixture of glucose and nutrients was added and the samples were further incubated for five days at 75% WHC (Blagodatskaya et al., 2010;Zhou et al., 2020a). The evolving CO2 was trapped in a KOH solution where the impedance of the solution was continuously measured. The average value of CO2 emission during the 3 h before and after adding substrates were taken as basal respiration (BR), and substrate-induced growth respiration (SIGR).</p>
<p>Microbial respiration in glucose amended soil was used to calculate the following kinetic parameters: the microbial maximal specific growth rate (µ), the growing microbial biomass (GMB) that capable for immediate growth on glucose, the total microbial biomass (TMB) responding by respiration to glucose addition, and the lag period (Tlag).</p>
<p>Microbial maximal specific growth rate μ was used as an intrinsic property of the microbial population to estimate the prevailing growth strategy of the microbial community. According to Blagodatskaya et al. (2010), higher μ reflects relative domination or shift towards fast-growing r-strategists, while lower μ values show relative domination or shift towards slow-growing K-strategists.</p>
<p>Considering that PHBV is partially soluble in chloroform at 30°C (Jacquel et al., 2007), the microbial biomass we measured by chloroform extraction may not only originate from the soil but also from PHBV degradation. Therefore, microbial biomass C (MBC) was determined using the initial rate of substrate-induced respiration after substrate addition according to the equation of Blagodatskaya et al. (2010): According to the concentration, all DNA samples were diluted to 1 ng µl -1 before PCR amplification. We note that the DNA extracted from Control-hotspots was leaked out during shipping for sequencing analysis, and then the concentration of DNA could not reach to the detection threshold. Therefore, the samples from this treatment could not be determined.</p>
<p>The V4 and V5 variable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified using the primers 515F (5'-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGAC-3') and 907R</p>
<p>(5'-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTC-3'). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification mixture was prepared with 1 μl purified DNA template (10 ng), 5 μl 10 × PCR buffer, 2.25 mmol l -1 MgCl2, 0.8 mmol l -1 deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.5 μmol l -1 of each primer, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, and</p>
<p>Briefly, de-noising and chimera analysis conducted with the AmpliconNoise and UCHIME algorithms were used to reduce sequence errors (Vargas-Gastelum et al., 2015). Furthermore, quality trimming was conducted to remove unwanted sequences shorter than 200 bp and reads containing ambiguous bases and with homopolymers longer than eight bases. The remaining sequences were used to identify the unique sequences by aligning with the <rs xml:id="12967786" type="software">SILVA</rs> reference database (v.<rs xml:id="12967787" type="version" corresp="12967786">128</rs>) <rs xml:id="12967788" type="bibr">(Quast et al., 2013)</rs>.</p>
<p>Within unique sequences, the
UCHIME tool was applied to remove chimeras. Then, "Chloroplast", "Mitochondria", or "unknown" were identified and removed from the dataset. Subsequently, after calculating the pairwise distance and generating the distance matrix, a 97% identity threshold was used to cluster sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) according to the UCLUST algorithm (Edgar et al., 2011). The most abundant sequence in each OTU was picked as the representative sequence. For each representative sequence, the <rs xml:id="12967789" type="software">SILVA</rs> reference database (v.<rs xml:id="12967790" type="version" corresp="12967789">128</rs>) was applied to annotate the taxonomic information using RDP classifier algorithm (Wang et al., 2007).
</p>
<p>The experiment was carried out with four replicates for each parameter. All values presented in the figures are means ± standard errors of the means (mean ± SE).</p>
<p>The enzyme kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) were fitted via the non-linear regression routine of
<rs xml:id="12967791" type="software">SigmaPlot</rs> (version

The DNA data were rarefied to an equal depth within the minimum observed sample size across all the samples. The following six parameters, namely Richness, Pielou, Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, and abundance-based coverage (ACE), were calculated to describe the alpha diversity of the soil bacterial community based on OTU abundance.

<p>The calculation was conducted in

</p>
<p>Prior to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the data were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk, p &gt; 0.05) and homogeneity of variance (Levene-test, p &gt; 0.05). Any dataset that was not normally distributed was root square or log10-transformed to conform with the assumption of normality before further statistical analysis. For alpha diversity index that did not conform to the assumption of normality, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test was applied to determine whether there were significant differences in alpha diversity among different treatments.</p>
<p>The mean plant biomass was 0.24 g pot -1 without microplastics addition (Table 1). However, PHBV addition ultimately resulted in plant death. PHBV addition greatly increased the soil microbial biomass and dissolved organic C content (p &lt; 0.05, Table 1). MBC and DOC were 12 and 54 times higher in the PHBV-treated than in the control soil, respectively. Additionally, MBN was 45% higher in the PHBV-treatment in comparison to the control, whereas DON decreased by 66% compared to the control soil.</p>
<p>The maximum potential enzyme activities (Vmax) were 0.6-and 5-folds higher for β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase in the microplastisphere than in the rhizosphere, respectively (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. 2a,b). Similarly, the substrate affinities (Km) of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase in the microplastisphere were 1.5-2 times higher in the rhizosphere, respectively (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. 2b,d). The Vmax and Km of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase in microplastisphere were significantly higher compared to those in the PHBV-treated bulk soil (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. 2). In the bulk soil, however, none of the tested enzymes were affected by PHBV addition (p &gt; 0.05, Fig. 2). Furthermore, the Vmax of β-glucosidase was positively correlated with active microbial biomass (R 2 = 0.7, p &lt; 0.05, Fig. S4). The catalytic efficiency (Vmax / Km) of leucine aminopeptidase was higher in the microplastisphere than in the rhizosphere (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. S2c), and the turnover time was approximately 5 times shorter in the microplastisphere than in the rhizosphere soil (Fig. S2d). However, no changes in the catalytic efficiency and turnover time for all the enzymes were found in the bulk soil between the PHBV-treated and control soil (p &gt; 0.05, Fig. S2). Further, the vector angle was lowest in the microplastisphere compared to other soil samples (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. S7d), indicating that microbial metabolisms may be N limited.</p>
<p>Different microbial growth patterns in response to substrate addition were observed among hotspots (microplastisphere and rhizosphere) and the bulk soil with and without PHBV addition (Fig. S3). The basal respiration (BR, 45 µg C g -1 h -1 ) and substrate-induced growth respiration (SIGR, 58 µg C g -1 h -1 ) in the microplastisphere were 10 times and 12 times higher relative to the rhizosphere soil, respectively (Fig. 3a,b). However, the BR and SIGR in the bulk soil were not affected by PHBV addition compared to the control.</p>
<p>Soil respiration showed a clear response to PHBV addition both in the hotspots and in bulk soil (Fig. S3). PHBV addition decreased the maximum specific growth rate (μ) by 22% in the microplastisphere compared to the bulk soil (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3c), whereas there was no difference in μ between the microplastisphere and the PHBV-treated bulk soil (p &gt; 0.05). Despite a slower specific growth rate, a 6-fold increase in the fraction of active microbial biomass, and a four times shorter lag period was observed in the microplastisphere vs. rhizosphere soil (Fig. 3d,e,f).</p>
<p>The dominant bacteria phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Thaumarchaeota, and Germmatimonadetes in all treatment soils (Fig. 4A), which together encompassed ca. 96-98% of the bacterial reads. Although the dominant phyla in all soils were consistent, changes in the relative abundances of the dominant taxa were observed across the treatments. There was a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria and a lower abundance of Firmicutes in soils with PHBV addition comparing with control treatment (p &lt; 0.05, Fig. 4A). In the family level, the fraction of these 20 dominant families with highest relative abundance decreased after PHBV addition (Fig. 4B). Specifically, the addition of PHBV induced the decrease of Planococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Bacillaceae and the increase of Chitinophagaceae, Comamonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae (Fig. 4B). The detailed family level changes of bulk and hotspot soil bacterial community induced by PHBV addition were also given in Figure 5C. Of the 3800 OTUs detected across all samples, the major numbers of OTUs (n = 3622) were shared by control-bulk, PHBV-bulk, and PHBV-hotspots soils, while 54 OTUs were unique to PHBV-hotspots soil and 16 OTUs were unique to the PHBV-bulk soil (Fig. 5A).</p>
<p>The mean values for ACE, Chao1, Richness, and Shannon indices in the PHBV-treated bulk soil increased by 10%, 11%, 16%, and 18% relative to the control soil, respectively (Fig. S5), while there were no differences between the microplastisphere and bulk soil after PHBV addition (p &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>PHBV in a polymeric or monomeric state is generally viewed as having very low cytotoxicity (Napathorn, 2014). In all the rhizoboxes added with PHBV, however, all the plants eventually died during the 4-week experiment. This is consistent with previous reports showing that degradation of conventional and bio-based microplastics might negatively affect plant growth when present at high concentrations (Qi et al., 2018;Qi et al., 2020b;Zang et al., 2020). Given that bioplastic polymers are solely composed of C, O and H, it is likely that PHBV addition to soil induced microbial immobilization of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) leading to increased plant stress (Volova et al., 2017;Boots et al., 2019). Such an N immobilization was further confirmed by the decreased DON but increased MBN in PHBV-added soil compared to the unamended control treatment (Table 1). This is consistent with Sander (2019) who found that microorganisms on the surface of microplastics need to acquire N from the surrounding soil to fuel growth. It also suggests that PHBV may have stimulated opportunistic plant pathogens (Matavulj et al., 1992), however, more work is required to confirm this. An alternative explanation might be that PHBV induced phytotoxicity due to acidification of the soil because of the release of high concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyric acid during PHBV degradation.</p>
<p>However, this would normally differentially affect root growth rather than shoot growth (Lucas et al., 2008). Further, based on the degradation of other biopolymers (e.g. cellulose, proteins), it is unlikely that an accumulation of the monomer will occur due to rapid microbial consumption (Jan et al., 2009). This is quite likely as it is the monomer which is naturally present as a microbial storage compound (Mason-Jones et al. 2019). However, it is possible that undisclosed additives or contaminants in the polymer might also have induced phytotoxicity (Zimmermann et al., 2019). Lastly, we cannot discount other general changes in soil properties and microbial communities following PHBV addition which may also have inhibited plant growth, contributing to plant death (Saarma et al., 2003;Wen et al., 2020). We conclude, that contrary to expectation, commercially-sourced PHBV was deleterious to plant growth, at least under higher concentrations of PHBV in the short term, as indicated by the lower seed germination over 7-days germination (Fig. S6). Further experiments are therefore needed to determine the mechanistic basis of this response.</p>
<p>Soil enzyme production is sensitive to both energy and nutrient availability (Allison et al., 2011). This tenet was supported in our study where the input of labile C (i.e. PHBV) increased enzyme activities in hotspots by up to 2 times compared to the bulk soil. This increase in microbial activity is unsurprising given that poly-3-hydroxybutyrate is a common storage compound produced by a wide range of taxonomically different groups of microorganisms, particularly in response to N deficiency and cold stress (Obruca et al., 2016). Consequently, the ability to use PHBV-C is expected to be a widespread trait within the microbial community. For C-and N-degrading enzymes, the activity difference between hotspots and the bulk soil was 2-10 times larger when PHBV was added (Fig. 2a,c), demonstrating that bioplastic incorporation into the soil directly influences C and N cycling. The higher Vmax of β-glucosidase in the microplastisphere versus rhizosphere soil can be attributed to the faster growing biomass after PHBV addition (Fig. 3e). This is supported by the positive correlation between our measurement of the active microbial biomass and the Vmax of β-glucosidase (R 2 = 0.7, Fig. S4). The increase in β-glucosidase also suggests that PHBV is stimulating the breakdown of other common soil polymers (i.e. cellulose). Further, PHBV could be broken down by depolymerases releasing hydroxybutyric acid monomers which fuel the production of energetically expensive exoenzymes (i.e. leucine aminopeptidase; Fig. 2c) capable of degrading SOM to acquire N for growth (i.e. positive priming; Zang et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2020a, b). This was supported by a higher BR and SIGR in the microplastisphere relative to the bulk soil (Fig. 3a,b), as well as the wider ratio of DOC and DON in the PHBV-treated soil (294) than in the control soil (1.77) (Table . 1). In accordance with previous studies, N limitation also induced an increase in the catalytic properties (Ka) of leucine aminopeptidase (Song et al., 2020). In line with this, the much shorter turnover time of substrates and higher Ka of leucine aminopeptidase in the microplastisphere was observed compared to the rhizosphere (Fig. S2c,d), which suggests that the community was more limited by N than P in the microplastisphere. This could be supported by lower proportional activity of C-to N-cycling enzymes but higher proportional activity of C-to P-cycling enzymes in the microplastisphere versus the rhizosphere (Fig. S7). The lower vector angle in the microplastisphere further confirmed the microbial metabolisms were likely limited by soil N. We therefore hypothesize that due to N limitation the microbial community either (i) changed the intrinsic properties of their hydrolytic enzymes to adapt to the presence of the C-rich bioplastic, and/or (ii) that PHBV induced a shift in the soil microbial community and thus the types of enzymes being produced (Kujur and Patel, 2013). Overall, we conclude that N limitation is connected with microbial N immobilization due to stimulated microbial growth after C supply from PHBV addition. The C input from the catabolism of PHBV will increase microbial biomass and intensify the N limitation. This was supported by the increased MBC and enzyme activities (especially N related), as well as the shift in enzymatic stoichiometric ratio and bacterial community. This contrasts with C hotpots in the rhizosphere, where the supply of C is probably less and where N is also lost from root epidermal cells in the form of amino acids providing a more balanced nutrient supply to the microbial community (Jones et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Here we speculate that PHBV breakdown was initially limited by the availability of polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase (Jendrossek et al., 1993). The abundance and level of expression of this enzyme in soil remains unknown, however, an NCBI search revealed its presence in a wide range of microbial taxa. Although PHB depolymerase may be internally targeted (i.e. to break down internal storage C), there is also a large amount of evidence that it can be externally targeted (i.e. be an exoenzyme; Jendrossek and Handrick, 2002), probably to degrade microbial necromass (Handrick et al., 2004). Our data support the view that PHBV can be used as a sole C substrate by the bacterial community when supplied exogenously (Martinez-Tobon et al., 2018).</p>
<p>However, we also observed a significant decrease (22%) in microbial specific growth rate μ in the microplastisphere compared to the rhizosphere, indicating the potential dominance of K-strategy microorganisms. K-strategists typically store more C in their cells and consume it slower (Nguyen and Guckert, 2001), lowering respiration rates.</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesize that PHBV degraders break down PHBV exogenously into monomeric units which can then be subsequently transported into the cell where re-polymerization into PHB occurs (Shen et al., 2015). Consequently, microbial community structure in the microplastisphere shifted toward species with a lower affinity to oligosaccharides and peptides indicated by a higher Km of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase.</p>
<p>PHBV addition was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi, and a decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes,</p>
<p>The latter have previously been described as fast-growing copiotrophs that thrive in environments of high C availability (Cleveland et al., 2007;Jenkins et al., 2010). In contrast, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi tend to dominate in oligotrophic environments where N availability is low (Ho et al., 2017). Nitrospirae are nitrite-oxidizing bacteria that are ubiquitous in terrestrial environments and that play a major role in biological N cycling and nitrification in agricultural soils (Xia et al., 2011). The higher abundance of Nitrospirae after PHBV addition indicated a change in N cycling (Zecchin et al., 2018), which was attributed to greater nutrient limitation in the microplastisphere than in the bulk soil (as indicated by Vmax ratio of C-to-N cycling enzymes; 5.1 vs. 8.6) (Table S1). The relative proportion of Bacteroidetes also increased in the PHBV treatments. These largely copiotrophic organisms are widely distributed in soils, and are considered to be specialized in degrading complex organic matter (Huang et al., 2019). Thus, DOM pools increased in the PHBV-treated soil compared with bulk soil due to the release of monomeric compounds from PHBV degradation (Table 1). Although only bacterial communities were investigated in this study, it is likely that fungi and mesofauna populations are also greatly affected by PHBV addition and involved in its degradation. Further studies are required to gain a better insight into the complex interactions between these groups. Overall, our results highlight the potential of PHBV to trigger metabolic changes in soil microorganisms (Fig. 6), and thus potentially impact their functional role in soil (Huang et al., 2019).</p>
<p>In addition to the microplastisphere, PHBV addition also changed the microbial community in the bulk soil, suggesting that these changes are not only confined to hotspots in the soil.</p>
<p>Microbial activity in agricultural soil is typically C-limited, such that even small C inputs can induce metabolic changes in the soil microbial community. Here we clearly showed that PHBV addition increased microbial activity, growth, and exoenzyme activity. This most likely leads to the enhanced mineralization of native SOM by co-metabolism, i.e. microorganisms degrade SOM by using degradable polymers (i.e. hydroxybutyric acid molecules) as an energy source. Remarkably, greater enzyme activity and microbial biomass, and lower affinity for the substrate were observed in the microplastisphere compared to the rhizosphere, indicating a stronger and faster C and nutrient turnover with PHBV addition in hotspots. Taken together, the unique environment may benefit microbial survival in PHBV-treated soil compared with the rhizosphere, possibly altering the soil ecological functions and biogeochemical processes, which may result in a stimulation of soil C and nutrients cycling. Although bioplastics have been heralded as a solution to petroleum-based plastics, our research indicates that it is also important to consider the potential disbenefits of bioplastics, e.g., for plant growth and health. This is exemplified in the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics and plastic mulch films in agriculture where the negative environmental consequences were only realized decades after their introduction (Sintim and Flurt, 2017;Qi et al., 2020b). Our research was designed to understand the short-term impact of a localized PHBV hotspot in soil. It is clear, however, that longer-term field-scale studies are also required. In-field testing of biodegradation of PHBV under different scenarios (e.g., soil types, agricultural practice, climate changes) as well as using a realistic mixture of polymers over longer periods is therefore required, with particular attention to plant-soil-microbial interactions. <rs xml:id="12967800" type="software">Metacoder</rs> heatmap to family level across different treatment.
