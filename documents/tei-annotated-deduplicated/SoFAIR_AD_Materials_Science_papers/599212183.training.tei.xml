<p>Strong optical absorption by a semiconductor is a highly desirable property for many optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. The optimal thickness of a semiconductor absorber is primarily determined by its absorption coefficient. To date, this parameter has been considered as a fundamental material property and efforts to realize thinner photovoltaics have relied on light-trapping structures that add complexity and cost. Here, we demonstrate that engineering cation disorder in a ternary chalcogenide semiconductor leads to significant absorption increase due to enhancement of the optical transition matrix elements. We show that cation disorder engineered AgBiS2 colloidal nanocrystals offer an absorption coefficient that is higher than any other photovoltaic material to date, enabling highly efficient extremely thin absorber photovoltaic devices.</p>
<p>We report solution-processed, environmentally-friendly, 30 nm-thick solar cells with short circuit current density of 27 mA•cm -2 , a power conversion efficiency of 9.17% (8.85% certified) and high stability under ambient conditions.</p>
<p>High-performance, lightweight solar cells featuring low cost and environmental friendliness have been a long-sought target in the photovoltaic field. Ultrathin solar cells can reduce material consumption and manufacturing demands, directly lowering the cost. Owing to an absorber thickness that is orders of magnitude lower than conventional solar cells, ultrathin solar cells further allow for flexible and light-weight form factors suited for building-or wearable-integrated photovoltaics. A thinner absorber layer also improves charge carrier collection and reduces bulk recombination, which are particularly prevalent in nanocrystalline solution-processed semiconductors 1,2 , thus improving performance provided strong light absorption. Furthermore, high absorption in small absorber volumes allows for operating the device at high photo-generated carrier densities, a physical regime which maximizes the opencircuit voltage (Voc) and permits advanced high-efficiency concepts such as hot-carrier solar cells 3 .</p>
<p>Currently, high performance ultrathin solar cells are mainly realized via different light-trapping strategies, which are employed to compensate for the short circuit current drop due to incomplete absorption in the ultrathin absorbing layer 4,5 . The use of optical architectures, however, increases non-radiative recombination 4,6 and complicates the manufacturing process, introducing additional obstacles toward low-cost high-efficiency devices.</p>
<p>Typically, the absorption coefficient of a material determines the required thickness for optimal light harvesting under photovoltaic operation. The absorption coefficient of a semiconductor has been considered as a fundamental parameter of the material, with efforts to enhance light absorption in ultrathin absorbers relying on optical means 4,5 . We instead took the viewmotivated by the fundamental relationship between atomic geometry, electronic structure and optical absorption -that the absorption coefficient of a semiconductor can be tuned by engineering the atomistic material structure.</p>
<p>Cation disorder is a widely observed phenomenon in multinary materials, referring to the deviation of atomic positions in the cationic sublattice from an ordered crystalline arrangement. This phenomenon significantly impacts the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors [7][8][9] and has traditionally been considered an undesirable (and often unavoidable) effect, due to its entropically-driven nature 7,8,10,11 . Herein, we leverage the modulation of cation disorder homogeneity in multinary semiconductors as a pathway to enhancing optical transition matrix elements, in order to achieve improved absorption coefficient and photovoltaic device efficiency.</p>
<p>In this work, we focus on ternary AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs), a solution-processed nanomaterial comprising environmentally-friendly elements 12,13 with reported efficiencies exceeding 6% in thin-film solar cells 1,14 . The cation distribution around Ag sites in AgBiS2 nanocrystals has shown evidence for non-random Ag-Ag correlation 15 , indicating the presence of inhomogeneous cation disorder (i.e. cation segregation with local Ag-rich and Bi-rich regions), likely due to growth kinetics during synthesis and surface ligand interactions [16][17][18] .</p>
<p>An illustration of inhomogeneous cation disorder within AgBiS2 NCs is shown in Fig. 1a. The valence band maximum (VBM) of AgBiS2 primarily derives from Ag d and S p states, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) arises from Bi p and S p interactions 19,20 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). A clear spatial separation of the Ag-derived VBM and Bi-derived CBM for the cation-segregated configuration can be observed in the local electronic density of states (LDOS), shown in Fig. 1c. In contrast, under homogeneous cation disorder, we predict a VBM and CBM delocalized over the entire material (Fig. 1d), with the correlation between cation distribution and spatial (de)localization of the band extrema further demonstrated by Fig. 1e.</p>
<p>The theoretically simulated absorption spectra of AgBiS2 for both inhomogeneous and homogenous cation disorder are provided in Fig. 2a. As expected, we find a substantially increased refractive index n and transition dipole matrix element (Supplementary Fig. 2), thus enhanced optical absorption upon homogenizing disorder.</p>
<p>To experimentally tune cationic disorder, we first assessed the thermodynamics of atomic reordering, in particular the formation energy difference needed to induce disorder. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to calculate the inter-site cation exchange energy.</p>
<p>Under the highest level of theory employed for phase energetics (hybrid DFT including spinorbit coupling effects), the bulk order-disorder enthalpy difference is calculated as 17.4 meV/atom, indicating the accessibility of cation site-swapping in AgBiS2 under mild annealing conditions. The mechanism behind cation inter-site exchange is likely defect-mediated ionic migration. Indeed, cation mobility aided by Ag vacancies and bond anharmonicity has been demonstrated in AgBiS2 nanocrystals [21][22][23] . Considering the low inter-site cation exchange energy in AgBiS2, we sought to anneal AgBiS2 NCs under low-temperature conditions to facilitate cation inter-site exchange and thus an entropically-driven transition to homogenous cation distribution. Fig. 2b plots the absorption coefficient of our NC films upon annealing under different temperatures. Comparing Fig. 2a and2b, the simulated absorption spectrum for cation segregation configurations (inhomogeneous disorder) matches well with the as-prepared AgBiS2 NC film, both exhibiting Urbach tailing at longer wavelengths, which is pernicious for photovoltaic devices 24,25 . However, in the homogenous cation-disordered structure, the simulated absorption coefficient is much higher than the cation-segregated case, with reduced bandtailing, manifesting favourable properties for optoelectronic applications 26 . As shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption coefficient of AgBiS2 NCs films is enhanced by up to a factor of two after annealing, alongside reduced Urbach energy from 173 meV to 26 meV (Supplementary Fig. 3), as predicted by ab initio calculations. Furthermore, this enhanced absorption is stable in ambient atmosphere, as spontaneous cation segregation is thermodynamically and entropically unfavourable (Supplementary Fig. 4). With this low-energy and scalable annealing process, we produce a semiconducting material that exhibits an absorption coefficient 5-10 times greater than any other material currently used in photovoltaic technology 4,[27][28][29][30][31] , across a wide spectral range from 400 -1000 nm (Fig. 2c).</p>
<p>With the high absorption coefficient of our films, an ultrathin layer of AgBiS2 NCs would be sufficient to absorb most of the light in the visible range. In order to assess the potential of our strongly-absorbing NC films, we calculate the maximum achievable short-circuit current density Jsc using the transfer matrix method 32,33 , assuming 100% internal quantum efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 5). Fig. 2d plots the maximum Jsc as a function of the active layer thickness for different annealing temperatures, corresponding to varying degrees of cation disorder homogeneity. Upon increased annealing temperature, we witness an increase in Jsc reached at low active layer thicknesses (t &lt; 200 nm). We predict a maximum Jsc of ~28 (32) mA•cm -2 for AgBiS2 NCs films annealed at 115℃ (150℃), with thicknesses of only ~30 nm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) was calculated assuming only radiative recombination in devices 34 . As shown in Fig. 2e, a high photovoltaic efficiency up to 26% was predicted for a 30 nm absorber layer, indicating the performance potential of ultrathin solar cells based on AgBiS2 NC films. Furthermore, with the thickness reduction of AgBiS2 absorber from 500 nm (common photovoltaic thickness) to 30 nm, we estimate a ~50% cost reduction over the full PV device cost (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 1).</p>
<p>To further verify the proposed cation homogenization as the underlying mechanism responsible for the optical absorption enhancement in AgBiS2 NC films, film thicknesses were first measured to exclude nanocrystal densification as the dominant factor. Negligible thickness changes were observed between the as-prepared and 115 ℃ annealed samples (Supplementary Fig. 7), with only a slight decrease for the 150 ℃ annealed films, contributing to a very small (~8%) absorption enhancement for this sample. These film thickness measurements demonstrate that densification effect is not the dominant factor in the absorption enhancement of these materials. Furthermore, we used X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to probe the changes in crystal structure due to cation disorder homogenization upon annealing. Interestingly, while XRD analysis suggested increased crystallite size (from 4.2 nm to 6.2 nm) upon annealing at 115℃, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) showed no measurable size differences in these samples (Supplementary Fig. 8). The sharpening of XRD peaks despite negligible NC growth indicates an improved crystallinity due to atomic rearrangements within the nanocrystals.</p>
<p>Further increasing the annealing temperature to 150℃ and 200℃ causes NCs to fuse to larger crystals (28 nm and 47 nm, Supplementary Fig. 8). Point defects are observable from HRTEM after high temperature annealing, which could be harmful for optoelectronic applications 35 (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition to peak narrowing in XRD patterns, the peak positions were also found to shift to higher angles upon annealing (Fig. 3a). To deconvolute the effect of crystal size and cation arrangement, and explain the apparent changes in crystallinity, we calculated the expected XRD patterns for homogeneously disordered cubic AgBiS2 (space group 3 , Supplementary Fig. 10), with crystal size as the only variable parameter (Supplementary Fig. 11). The full width half maximum (FWHM) of all peaks sharpens with crystal growth, while the peak positions remain essentially the same, as expected. However, transitioning from cation-segregated configurations to homogeneous cation disorder, while fixing the crystallite size, the simulated XRD patterns of AgBiS2 show distinct peak shifts to higher angles as well as peak narrowing (Fig. 3b), matching the experimental observations of improved crystallinity upon annealing. The XRD peak shifts primarily originate from the shortening of Ag-S bond lengths, while peak narrowing occurs due to narrowing of the bond length distributions and reduction of octahedral distortion, upon homogenization of the cation distribution (Supplementary Fig. 12). This phenomenon was further confirmed with HRTEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 3c andd, with integrated line profiles of the {200}-plane showing a slight shrinkage after annealing, further confirming the transition from cation segregation to homogeneous disorder.</p>
<p>Considering the difference in local bonding environments for different cation configurations, changes in Madelung potential were expected 36 . We calculate the average Madelung potential at Bi sites as 3.29 V and 4.66 V for segregated and homogeneous cation configurations, respectively, using Bader atomic charges. A greater Madelung potential suggests a decrease in XPS binding energy, upon transitioning from inhomogeneous to homogeneous cation disorder 36,37 . As shown in Fig. 3e, the Bi 5d peaks in the simulated XPS spectra are noticeably shifted to lower binding energies for homogeneous cation disorder, as compared to cationsegregated configurations. Likewise, the annealed AgBiS2 NCs show a small but significant chemical shift to lower energy, compared with as-prepared samples (Fig. 3f andg), in agreement with our proposition of cation homogenization upon annealing.</p>
<p>Having developed a material with such strong optical absorption, we next sought to produce highly efficient ultrathin solution-processed solar cells with these nanocrystals. Solar cells were fabricated with an architecture of Glass/ITO/SnO2/AgBiS2/HTL/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 4a. Cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the ultrathin nature of the device layers (Fig. 4b). We first used PTB7 as an electron blocking layer, in accordance with previous studies 1,14 . The devices showed an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.4 ± 0.6%, with a champion device reaching PCE of 7.6% (Table 1) -higher than the previously reported record performance of 6.3% 1,14,[38][39][40] . Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed a surface roughness of 0.6 nm for a 4 nm PTB7 film (Supplementary Fig. 13), which undermines the performance of the cells by introducing interface recombination 41 . We sought to replace PTB7 with an alternative electron-blocking layer with improved morphological characteristics. We found that PTAA yielded improved uniformity (RMS roughness of 0.4 nm), a prerequisite for suppressing current leakage and interface recombination. In order to further assess the superiority of PTAA, transient photocurrent (TPC) and photo-voltage (TPV) were measured under one-Sun light bias (Supplementary Fig. 14). Devices with PTAA showed a faster photocurrent decay and longer carrier lifetime than that with PTB7 as the HTL, which</p>
<p>indicates improved charge extraction and reduced interface recombination. As a result, replacing PTB7 with PTAA leads to significant improvement in Voc and fill factor (FF) (Supplementary Fig. 13), and results in a ~20% increase in power conversion efficiency to 8.7 ± 0.3%, with a best device reaching 9.17% (Fig. 4c andd). One of our champion devices was sent to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA), which certified a PCE of 8.85% under AM1.5G full sun illumination, with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 15). The measured Jsc of 27 mA•cm -2 was further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum, which gives a value of 26.5 mA•cm -2 (Fig. 4f). In addition, the measured EQE spectrum matched well with the TMM predicted EQE, indicating a near-unity internal quantum efficiency (IQE). However, unannealed devices showed not only lower absorption (i.e.</p>
<p>predicted EQE) in near infrared region, but also a lower IQE (Fig. 4f) and larger Voc deficit, which is ascribed to slower charge extraction, Urbach band tailing and higher trap density (Supplementary Fig. 16). Higher temperature annealing leads to significantly lower performance, which is consistent with the defects forming from uncontrolled nanocrystal fusing (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Fig. 17). Analysing the absorption loss of our record performance ultrathin devices, a large part of the incident light (~10 mA•cm -2 ) was reflected (Supplementary Fig. 18) and further improvement of device performance is expected by introducing an antireflection layer or advanced light-trapping techniques.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thicker (200 nm) devices are also fabricated for direct comparison with ultrathin devices and, as expected, a low Jsc (~15 mA•cm -2 ) was obtained (Supplementary Fig. 19). In order to further understand the devices, time-of-flight (ToF) was employed to investigate the charge carrier mobilities in our AgBiS2 NC films (Supplementary Fig. 20). The hole and electron mobility are calculated to be 1.2 × 10 -4 and 5.7 × 10 -5 cm 2 •V -1 •s -1 , respectively.</p>
<p>Combining with the carrier lifetime extracted from TPV measurements, the diffusion length is estimated to be ~25.4 nm, which rationalizes the near-unity IQE in our 30 nm devices and the low performance in 200 nm thick devices. Mid-gap trap density was estimated from TPC/TPV measurements (Supplementary Fig. 16). In our optimal AgBiS2 NC films, the trap density is ~ 9×10 16 cm -3 . Although this trap density is four times lower than before annealing (~ 4×10 17 cm - 3 ), efforts are needed to further passivate the trap states for higher Voc and thus, higher efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to power conversion efficiency, stability is another important figure-of-merit of photovoltaic devices. Therefore, in order to assess the stability of our AgBiS2 NC solar cells, we first measured their shelf lifetime by storing the un-encapsulated devices in ambient conditions with a temperature of ~25℃ and relative humidity of ~30%. The device showed a gradual improvement in the first 20 days (Supplementary Fig. 21), which is likely a result of oxidation of MoOx layer and a better band alignment 44 (Supplementary Fig. 22). Furthermore, the device retained its original performance after four months' aging. The operational stability was further investigated by subjecting the un-encapsulated device to AM1.5G one sun illumination in ambient atmosphere with relative humidity ~ 60%. The device performance was measured by applying a forward bias fixed at the maximum power point (MPP). As shown in Fig. 4g, the PCE of the PTB7 device dropped below 2% after 20 minutes illumination, while the PTAA device demonstrated much better operational stability under continuous operation.</p>
<p>After 10 hours MPP testing on un-encapsulated cell in ambient conditions, the device retained 85% of its original efficiency. Longer stability at MPP was also recorded with a class AA solar light source, showing ~80% of original performance after 40h test in ambient air (Supplementary Fig. 23). To our knowledge the devices reported herein set a record among low-temperature and solution-processed, non-toxic inorganic solar cells in terms of stability and performance [45][46][47][48] . These results support that AgBiS2 NCs is extremely promising material for low-cost, efficient, stable and environmentally friendly solar cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the absorption coefficients of ternary AgBiS2 NCs can be enhanced via cation disorder homogenization at mild annealing conditions. Ultra-high absorption coefficients were obtained in annealed AgBiS2 NC films, with a calculated SLME of over 26% for a 30 nm NC film. The transition in cation configuration was further confirmed by the combination of ab initio calculations with XRD, HRTEM and XPS measurements.</p>
<p>Ultrathin solar cells are fabricated based on ultra-absorbing AgBiS2 NCs. A high Jsc of 27 mA•cm -2 and a record efficiency up to 9.17% were obtained with an independent certification of 8.85% from Newport. The air stability and photostability was also recorded in high performance devices. Our work not only establishes the potential of ultrathin AgBiS2 NC solar cells, which are solution-processable and RoHS-compliant, but also demonstrates the importance of atomic configuration engineering in multinary systems. accurately predict the electronic structures of semiconductor materials 59,60 . To account for relativistic effects, due to the presence of heavy-atom elements Ag and Bi, spin-orbit coupling effects were included in all electronic and optical calculations (HSE06+SOC).</p>
<p>Secondly, to investigate the effects of both partial order and inhomogeneous disorder (i.e.</p>
<p>cation segregation with Ag-rich and Bi-rich regions) on the cation sublattice, all possible configurations for AgBiS2 in a 32-atom rocksalt structure were enumerated using the <rs xml:id="12967374" type="software">Transformer</rs> package <rs xml:id="12967375" type="bibr">61</rs> , yielding 440 symmetry-inequivalent arrangements. Here, the PBEsol 42 semi-local exchange-correlation functional was used for geometry optimisations and energetic analysis, motivated by its well-established accuracy for the structural relaxation of bulk solids 43 and moderate computational cost. Moreover, this functional was tested against both experiment and the computationally-intensive HSE06 hybrid DFT functional for bulk geometry optimisation and energetics respectively, using all known structures in the Ag-Bi-S system.</p>
<p>Here, PBEsol was found to accurately reproduce experimentally-reported crystal structures, with a mean absolute error &lt;1.5% in the lattice parameters, as well as reproducing the energetic ordering of phases on the convex hull according to both HSE06 and experiment.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency when comparing the results of these calculations to that of 3 (SQS)</p>
<p>AgBiS2, a new 32-atom SQS supercell was generated using the same procedure as outlined above, and relaxed with PBEsol. In this case, a perfect 'objective function' match to the true disordered solution was obtained. While appropriate for structural and energetic analysis of cation configurations in AgBiS2, semi-local DFT is known to severely underestimate electronic bandgaps 64,65 , and so the HSE06+SOC hybrid DFT functional was used to calculate the optical and electronic properties of these configurations. In this case, downsampling of the Fock exchange matrix by a factor of 2 (NKRED = 2) was employed to reduce the computational cost to a manageable level. This choice was confirmed to affect the electronic bandgap by &lt;0.05 eV for the 32-atom SQS supercell.</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of supercell size on the calculated properties, the 32-atom SQS supercell was also relaxed with the HSE06 functional, to then compare with the 64-atom structure. The total energy was found to match that of the 64-atom SQS supercell to &lt;1 meV/atom, while the bandgap was found to increase slightly from 0.69 eV to 0.83 eV for the 32-atom supercell.</p>
<p>Post-processing. Primitive and unfolded electronic band structure diagrams were generated using <rs xml:id="12967376" type="software">sumo</rs> and

<p>Synthesis of AgBiS2 nanocrystals. The Schlenk technique was used to synthesize AgBiS2 nanocrystals, following previous report with modifications 1,14 . 4 mmol Bi(OAc)3, 3.2 mmol Ag(OAc), 24 mL oleic acid (OA) and 15 mL 1-octadecene (ODE) was pumped at 100℃ for 2 hours (~0.2 mbar) to remove oxygen and moisture. 4 mmol hexamethyldisilathiane (HMS) dissolved in 5 mL ODE was quickly injected into the flask. The heating mantel was removed and the reaction was cooled down with water bath for ~5 min. After that, the crude solution was left stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. The nanocrystals were isolated by adding acetone, followed by centrifugation. The extracted nanocrystals were re-dispersed in toluene and acetone was added to precipitate nanocrystals. The re-dispersion/precipitation was repeated once more. Finally, the obtained AgBiS2 nanocrystals powder was dispersed in anhydrous toluene (20 mg mL -1 ) and stored in ambient atmosphere for device fabrication.</p>
<p>Characterization of AgBiS2 nanocrystals and films. Films exchanged with 3mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) were grown on glass substrates, followed by annealing at different temperatures in glovebox. The thicknesses were measured using a profilometer. The complex refractive index was measured at various angles using broadband Sopra Ellipsometer 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)/methanol (1% v/v) solution was then applied to the nanocrystals film for 45s, followed by two rinse-spin steps with methanol and once with toluene. The films were transferred into glovebox for 10 min annealing at 115℃ and then stored in dry air before spincoating PTB7 (5 mg mL -1 in dichlorobenzene) or PTAA solution (2 mg mL -1 in toluene) at 3000 rpm. Finally, a Kurt J. Lesker Nano36 system was used to deposit 3 nm of MoO3 and 120 nm of Ag through a shadow mask to produce solar cells with a diameter of 2 mm (area of 3.14 mm 2 ).</p>
<p>All device characterization was performed in air under ambient conditions. Current-voltage measurements were performed with a Keithyley 2400 Sourcemeter and a Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator with an AM1.5G filter. The intensity of the solar light was calibrated using a Hamamatsu S1336 silicon photodiode that had been calibrated at the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems, Freiburg, Germany. The solar cells were measured with and without masks, and slightly lower Voc was observed when measuring with masks, due to masking effect. For certified cells, appropriate masks have always been used.</p>
<p>The EQE was measured using a Newport Cornerstone 260 monochrometer, a Thorlabs A 520 nm nanosecond laser was used as the excitation light. Photocurrent decay was recorded at various bias with an oscilloscope. The mobility was calculated by fitting the d 2 /t-Vbias plots.</p>

<p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. The
<rs xml:id="12967391" type="software">AiiDA</rs> infrastructure was used to maintain data provenance for all calculations performed in this study 49 . Calculations were performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within periodic boundary conditions through the
<rs xml:id="12967392" type="software">Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)</rs> <rs xml:id="12967393" type="bibr">[50]</rs><rs xml:id="12967394" type="bibr">[51]</rs><rs xml:id="12967395" type="bibr">[52]</rs> . Using the projector-augmented wave method, scalar-relativistic potentials were employed to describe the interaction between core and valence electrons. 53 Calculations were carried out using Γ-centred k-point meshes with a reciprocal space sampling of 0.11 Å -1 and a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 300 eV (increased to 450 eV for structural relaxations, to avoid the possibility of Pulay stress). With these parameter choices, the ground-state energies of all known structures in the Ag-Bi-S system were converged to within 1 meV/atom. Cation Disorder. To model the effects of varying degrees of cation order/disorder, two approaches were employed. Firstly, to simulate total random cation disorder, a 64-atom supercell for AgBiS2 in the 3 rocksalt structure was generated using the special quasirandom structure (SQS) method 54 , in which the cation-cation cluster correlations are optimised to obtain the best approximation to an ideal infinite random distribution for a given supercell.

<p>Here, the

Eight Monte-Carlo simulations were performed, with the structure giving the best match to the true disordered solid solution chosen for further calculations.
