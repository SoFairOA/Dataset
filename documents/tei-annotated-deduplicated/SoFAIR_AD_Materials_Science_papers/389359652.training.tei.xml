<p>The functionalization of silica-coated, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, with an ironcontaining ionic liquid, allows for the synthesis of a Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim) [FeCl 4 ] system that can be employed as a magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst. Herein, we present the use of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim) [FeCl 4 ] for the glycolysis of PET into BHET under conventional heating. The catalyst achieved nearly 100% yield and selectivity over twelve consecutive reaction cycles at 180 °C and was efficiently recovered without tedious work-up or purification processes. Additional analyses revealed that the amount of catalyst lost after each cycle was negligible and no trace of Fe was found in the purified BHET product.</p>
<p>Nowadays, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the fourth most manufactured plastic polymer, after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). The global PET production in 2014 amounted to some 42 million metric tons and it is predicted to increase to approximately 74 million metric tons by 2020. [1] However, its manufacture and use presents many problems, including the requirement of non-renewable fossil fuel precursors, the astonishing amount of waste generated, and the CO 2 emissions related to both the production and disposal of PET products. [2] Therefore, the recycling of postconsumer PET is essential to save energy and protect our environment. [3] Chemical recycling of PET waste involves the partial or total depolymerisation of this polymer into its monomers and oligomers, which can then be re-polymerised to yield recycled PET. [4] Common depolymerization routes employed for chemical recycling of PET are methanolysis, hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis, ammonolysis and hydrogenation, among others. [5] In this context, glycolysis is a very convenient method due to its simplicity and low cost, but the non-catalysed process is very slow. [6] This transformation has been described by the use of a wide range of catalysts, such as metal acetates, titanium phosphate, solid superacids, carbonates, sulfates, deep eutectic solvents, nanoparticles, and microbial agents. [7,8,9,10,11] In particular, ionic liquids (ILs) have been increasingly explored as catalysts for PET glycolysis since the first report in 2009. [12] In a subsequent publication, Zhang et al. described the use of halometallate-based ILs for the depolymerization of PET in ethylene glycol (EG). [13] These acidic ILs operate as bifunctional catalysts acting simultaneously as a Lewis acid and nucleophile, showing higher activities and selectivities than those observed by the use of simple metal salts or solely organic ILs. Despite their advantages, in terms of selectivity and yield, only a few examples have been described where catalyst recovery is achieved employing expensive techniques, such as vacuum distillation. [14,15,16,17] If the catalyst recycling problem was solved, for example by immobilization using inorganic supports, halometallate-based ILs could be applicable in industrial processes. In this context, surface functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) is an important and emerging area in the catalysis field. [18,19] Specifically, silica-coated magnetite nano-supports have attracted much attention due to their unique properties, such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, economic viability and simple preparation methods. [18] More importantly, retrieval of the NPs via magnetic separation provides an elegant alternative to cumbersome filtration, vacuum distillation, or centrifugation techniques in terms of time, energy and efficiency of catalyst retention. [20,21] Inspired by these works, we report a new, highly active, bifunctional catalytic system, Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] (mim: methylimidazolium), that provides nearly 100% selectivity and yield in the glycolysis of PET in EG at T&lt;180 °C. This thermally-stable, high-surface area nanocatalyst combines high activity with a facile magnetic recovery method and can be reused for up to 15 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case which describes the surface modification of nano-magnetite materials with paramagnetic ILs (MILs), opening the door to the design of new nanomaterials with a wide range of possible functional groups in the shell. The depolymerization of PET catalyzed by magnetic NPs has been described for metal oxide spinel, [22] Mn 3 O 4 [23] and γ-Fe 2 O 3 . [24] However, the obtained BHET has often low purity and the required temperatures are higher (260-300 °C) than those used for this novel nanocatalyst.</p>

<p>The synthesis of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles MNPs was performed in four stages following the literature procedure. [26] Next, the MNPs were coated with silica using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) to obtain the silica-coated MNPs (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 ), [27] followed by the functionalization of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 with methylimidazolium-chloride. [26] The last step of the synthesis was the introduction of the paramagnetic ionic liquid onto the surface of the nanoparticles. For this purpose, Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @mim-Cl (2 g) was dispersed in an aqueous FeCl 3 solution (100 mL, 7% (w/v)) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 48 h to allow the substitution of the Cl -by FeCl</p>
<p>For the catalytic experiments, 15 mg of catalyst, 100 mg of PET and 1 mL of EG, were placed in a 10 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser. The mixture was heated under reflux at 170 or 190 °C (160 and 180 ºC inside the reaction flask, respectively) for 24 h. After the specified time, the flask was cooled down to R.T. and 10 mL of distilled water were added to the reaction crude. The catalyst was separated from the aqueous phase with an external magnet and washed with distillated water two times. The different aqueous solutions were combined and the undepolymerized PET was separated from the resulting mixture and dried at 80 °C. The mixture was filtered and the liquid phase was evaporated at 72 mbar using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C to remove water. An aliquot of the residue (100 mg) was dissolved in DMSO-d 6 and analyzed by 1 H and 13 C NMR to determine the amount of BHET product using 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (0.1 mmol) as an internal standard. The purity of the BHET product was confirmed using a wide range of techniques, such as XRPD, 1 H and The conversion of PET is calculated using the following equation:</p>
<p>In which W 0 is the initial weight of PET and W 1 is the weight of undepolymerized PET. In addition, the yield and selectivity of BHET are defined by equations ( 2) and (3):</p>

<p>15 mg of catalyst, 100 mg of PET and 1 mL of EG, were placed in a 10 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser.

The catalyst was separated from the aqueous phase with an external magnet and washed with distillated water two times.

The reaction flask containing the catalyst was dried using a rotary evaporator at 72 mbar and 40 °C to remove water. The catalyst was then used for the next cycle.</p>
<p>Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @mim-Cl (1) was obtained by a previously described protocol (for further details see section 2.3). [27] Subsequently, 2 g of 1 were dispersed in 100 mL of 7% (w/v) FeCl 3 (aq) and stirred for 48 h, leading to the substitution of Cl -by FeCl 4 -in a simple step and the synthesis of</p>
<p>The nanostructured catalyst 2 has been extensively characterized by TGA, XRPD, TEM, EDX, HR-TEM, XPS, and magnetic measurements. TGA revealed that 2 is thermally stable up to 250 °C (Figure S1, Supporting Information), confirming the durability of the system at temperatures employed in the catalytic experiments. XRPD analysis (Figure S2, Supporting Information) showed the presence of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and indicated that the mean NP diameter to be 9.2 nm. In addition, the XRPD spectrum of 2 presents a broad peak between 15 and 25° (2θ) that corresponds to the amorphous SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] shells. [28] TEM analysis revealed the presence of well-dispersed and approximately-spherical nanoparticles with an average size ca. 11 ± 1 nm (Figures S6-S11, Supporting Information). Moreover, HR-TEM images (Figure 1) showed crystalline nanoparticles compatible with the characteristic face centered cubic (fcc) pattern for Fe 3 O 4 crystals viewed along with the [311] axis with predominant lattice fringe distance of 0.253 nm (core) covered by an amorphous layer of SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] of ranging between 0.5-2.0 nm in thickness. The observed thickness of the silica (Figure 1b) also depends on the angle that the particle is imaged at. For example, tilting of the TEM sample holder through 20° in the x-axis showed that the apparent thickness could decrease by approximately 20% (See figure S12, Supporting Information). XPS measurements confirmed the presence of the imidazolium cation in the shell (Figure 2a). The Fe 2p 3/2 signal (Figure 2c) was deconvoluted into two components associated to Fe 2+ (709.4 eV) and Fe 3+ (712.4 eV), which correspond to Fe 3 O 4 oxidation states [29] and are in agreement with XRPD and HRTEM results. The signal associated with FeCl 4 overlaps with a very intense Fe 3 O 4 NP core signal, but the Cl 2p signal suggested the presence of a thin FeCl 4 layer on the nanoparticle surface (Figure 2b). Indeed, EDX corroborated the presence of Fe, Cl, Si and O in the sample (Figure S14, Supporting Information). In addition, a STEM-EDX elemental map over a single Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] particle (Figures S15 andS16) showed the presence of Fe, Cl, Si and O in the shell, proving the presence of the iron-containing ionic liquid in the surface of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 . Elemental analysis gave a halometallate-based IL content of ca. 20.6% in 2, which is supported by TGA (ca. 17.3%, see figure S1, Supporting Information). The magnetic susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature (Figure S17a, Supporting Information) showed typical features of single domain nanoparticles with a broad size distribution due to random dipolar interactions. The magnetic analysis (Section 6, Supporting Information) proved that a spin glass (SG)-like, rather than superparamagnetic freezing, seems to be occurring within the sample. Moreover, the response of magnetization to the applied magnetic field (Figure S17b, Supporting Information) is characteristic of an assembly of NPs. Finally, the fitting of the M(H) curves with the numerical inversion method [30] (Figure S18, Supporting Information) provided a value for the average size of 9.3  (1) nm, in good agreement with XRPD and TEM data.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] MNPs (2) was evaluated for the glycolysis of PET in EG under conventional heating conditions (for further details see section 2.4.1). We employed PET pellets purchased from Goodfellow Inc. (diameter 3-5 mm). The BHET product was obtained with high purity (Figures S20 andS21, Supporting Information) by crystallization in water at 4 °C (for further details see section 2.4.1). This was confirmed using a wide range of techniques, such as TGA, DSC, FT-IR, XRPD, ESI-MS, 1 H and 13 C NMR, and GC-MS (Section 8 and figures S22-S29, Supporting Information). Moreover, no traces of Fe were found in the purified product by scanning electron microscope (SEM), which proves the suitability of the described procedure to obtain highly pure BHET that can be employed in subsequent applications.</p>
<p>The first set of experiments was carried out with a reaction temperature of 170 °C (160 °C inside the reaction flask). The conversion of PET and the yield of BHET product reached up to 63 and 59%, respectively (Figure 3). The comparison of these results with those observed for the analogous nonsupported halometallate-based IL (dimim) [FeCl 4 ] at the same temperature (99% conversion and 78% yield for 0.085 mmol catalyst and 125 mg PET) [31] indicates that the activity of 2 is lower. However, we have to bear in mind that the catalyst loading is a crucial factor in the glycolysis of PET [16] and the amount of catalytically active material is much lower in 2 (ca. 0.01 mmol of MIL in 15 mg of 2 employed for 100 mg PET), since the catalyst is present only in the shell of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] NPs. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the activity in the second cycle of catalyst recovery and reuse for (dimim)[FeCl 4 ] (from 99 to 5% yield) due to a gradual loss and/or decomposition of the catalyst as a consequence of the repeated washing cycles. [31] However, the nanocatalyst 2 was magnetically recyclable in 3 min (Figure 4, for further details see section 2.4.2), which represents an easy retrieval method compared to the tedious and expensive procedures mentioned previously. Indeed, the recovered nanocatalyst was reused for up to fifteen cycles at 160 °C showing good recycling performance (Figure 3). In addition, a variable activity was observed for the different cycles. At this temperature, unreacted or partly reacted polymer was adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface, which hinders the complete separation of the catalyst from substrate and products during the recycling process, and thus leads to a fluctuation in the results. This has been demonstrated by performing a TGA of the nanoparticles after reaction at 160 ºC (Figure S40), which shows a 16.4% of adsorbed organic material. The catalytic activity of 2, containing a Lewis acid and a nucleophile within the structure, was also compared with that observed for ILs supported on NPs. To this end, Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[PF 6 ] NPs</p>
<p>(3) of 11  (1) nm were synthesized and characterized by XRPD, TEM and XPS (Figures S3, S13 and S19, Supporting Information). [27] Although 3 exhibits similar recycling behavior as 2, and can be reused up to 15 cycles (Figure S30, Supporting Information), the reaction showed lower activity (up to 40% conversion of PET and 36% yield of BHET), thus proving the importance of the halometallate complex in the catalytic process. The reaction mechanism in the glycolysis of PET catalysed by 2 is well aligned with that accepted for PET degradation mediated by imidazolium-based metal-containing ionic liquids, which is a Lewis acid catalytic process; [14,15,16] both the imidazolium cation and metal complex anion play a key synergic role through hydrogen-bonding interactions with EG and the ester groups of PET, [32] leading to enhanced activities and selectivities compared to those observed for purely organic imidazolium-based ILs. [13,31] The reaction temperature is a critical factor in the glycolysis of PET catalyzed by ILs where higher temperatures favor the formation of BHET. [12] As 2 is stable up to 220 °C, another set of glycolysis reactions with the same experimental setting were carried out at 190 °C (180 °C inside the reaction flask). Interestingly, the activity of 2 improved significantly and, as can be seen in figure 5, quantitative conversions of PET and yields of BHET product were obtained. Conversely, the analogous non-supported iron-containing IL (dimim)[FeCl 4 ] only gave 80% conversion and 50% yield under the same reaction conditions. More importantly, catalyst 2 was reused up to twelve cycles without any significant loss in the catalytic activity and with only a slight decrease in the selectivity,</p>
<p>showing an excellent recycling behavior.</p>
<p>Comparing with other systems based on a non-expensive and abundant metallic element such as iron, Pingale and coworkers described 63% yield of BHET at 197 ºC in the glycolysis of postconsumer PET bottle waste catalysed by FeCl 3 (EG, 7 h, 0.5% FeCl 3 w/w), but the catalytic system was not reused. [33] Similarly, Zhang et al. employed the iron-containing ionic liquid (bmim)[FeCl 4 ] (bmim = 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) for PET degradation. [13] This non-reusable catalyst gave quantitative conversion of PET and 59.2% selectivity towards BHET in 4 h at 178 ºC. In the field of magnetic nanoparticles, Kim and coworkers described superparamagnetic γ-Fe 2 O 3 NPs of 10.5 nm in size as a recyclable catalyst for the glycolysis of PET. [24] This nanocatalyst was reused for up to 10 cycles, 66% PET conversion and 62% BHET yield for Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 ). Thus, these results confirmed the crucial role of halometallate-based IL shell in the PET degradation process.</p>
<p>As shown in the present study, this new type of nanocatalyst displays very interesting features in terms of Lewis-acidity, activity, selectivity, stability, recovery, recyclability, and capacity for tuning with a wide range of halometallate-based IL shell. [34,35,36,37,38] Consequently, they could be very useful for other reactions catalyzed by halometallate-based ILs, such as glycosidation, [39] Michael addition, [40] desulfurization, [41] CO 2 fixation into cyclic carbonates, [42,43] Friedel Crafts acylation, [44] and benzylation of arenes into diarylmethanes. [45]</p>
<p>In summary, a halometallate-based IL was immobilized on the surface of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 NPs via a simple and accessible procedure. The resulting Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] MNPs were fully characterized by the use of a wide variety of techniques. This bifunctional catalytic system showed very high activity for the glycolysis of PET, leading to quantitative yields of BHET monomer at 180 °C. Importantly, the system exhibits an excellent recycling behavior and can be easily recovered with an external magnetic field. Indeed, this nanocatalyst was reused for up to twelve cycles at 180 °C without any significant loss in the catalytic activity (84% yield of BHET in the twelfth run).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the catalytic system remained active in the fifteenth cycle of recovery and reuse at 160 °C. Additional studies showed that the amount of catalyst lost after each cycle was minimal, proving the efficacy of the magnetic separation procedure. The absence of even trace amounts of Fe in the purified product further illustrates the benefits of the described methodology to obtain highly pure BHET for potential reuse.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a new type of nanocatalyst with very exciting properties in terms of Lewis-acidity, stability, magnetism and capacity of tuning with a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds has been devised. In this first application the catalytic system was employed in the PET degradation process, but after this thorough study the road seems open for many catalytic reactions mediated by halometallate-based ILs.</p>
