<p>Periodic undulating topographies (such as sandwaves and sandbars) are very common in coastal and estuarine areas. Normally incident water surface waves propagating from open sea to coastal areas may interact strongly with such topographies. The wave reflection by the periodic undulating topography can be significantly amplified when the surface wavelength is approximately twice the wavelength of the bottom undulations, which is often called as Bragg resonant reflection.</p>
<p>Although the investigations on the hydrodynamic characteristics related to Bragg reflection of a region of undulating topography have been widely implemented, the effects of Bragg reflection on harbors have not yet been studied. Bragg resonant reflection can effectively reduce the incident waves. Meanwhile, however, it can also significantly hinder the wave radiation from the harbor entrance to the open sea. Whether Bragg reflection can be utilized as a potential measure to alleviate harbor oscillations is unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, Bragg reflection and their interactions with the harbor are simulated using a fully nonlinear Boussinesq model,

For the purpose, an elongated harbor with constant depth is considered, and a series of sinusoidal bars with various amplitudes and numbers are deployed outside the harbor. The incident waves considered in this paper include regular long waves and bichromatic short wave groups. It is revealed for the first time that for both kinds of

<p>Harbor oscillations (also called harbor resonance or seiches) refer to the gathering and magnification of the incident wave energy inside bays or harbors, which can be triggered by atmospheric fluctuations, infragravity waves, tsunami waves, steady-state or transient wave groups, shear flows, or seisms (Bellotti, 2007;De Jong and Battjes, 2004;Fabrikant, 1995;Gao et al., 2017a;Gao et al., 2020;Kumar and Gulshan, 2017;Okihiro and Guza, 1996;Zheng et al., 2021). It may interrupt the operation of docks, create excessive movements of moored ships, cause unacceptable mooring forces, and even lead to the break of mooring lines (Gulshan et al., 2020;Kumar et al., 2016). The research progresses on harbor oscillations during the last three decades have been reviewed and summarized by Rabinovich (2009).</p>
<p>Harbor resonance phenomenon began to attract attention of coastal engineers from 1940s (Knapp and Vanoni, 1945), and the related scientific investigations started from the early 1950s (Vanoni and Carr, 1950). Most of existing studies focus on the stationary harbor resonance triggered by periodic oceanic waves propagating from the open sea, such as steady-state infragravity waves or steady-state short wave groups. Before the energy propagating from the external incident waves is balanced by energy dissipation generated by bottom friction, boundary absorption, and radiation from the entrance, the stationary resonance inside a bay or a harbor grows significantly (e.g., Gao et al. (2017b); Gao et al. (2019b); Kumar and Gulshan (2018); Losada et al. (2008); Wang et al. (2014)). A small number of scholars have also implemented the investigations on the transient harbor oscillations, which are basically triggered by tsunami waves or transient wave groups (Endoh et al., 2018;Gao et al., 2021;Gao et al., 2019a;Gao et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Water surface waves scattered by the periodic undulating seabed have been widely investigated in the past four decades (e.g., Davies and Heathershaw (1984); Hsu et al. (2007); Liu et al. (2019a); Miles and Chamberlain (1998)). When investigating the issue of water surface waves propagating over a region of sinusoidal undulating topography, the most attractive phenomenon is the wellknown Bragg resonant reflection of incident waves. When the wavelength of the periodic bottom undulations is approximately one half of the wavelength of the water surface waves, the overwhelming majority of the incoming waves could be reflected by the periodic undulating seabed, which would cause the significant decrease of the transmitted waves to the shoreline (Davies and Heathershaw, 1984;Liu et al., 2019b). The Bragg reflection phenomenon provide a possibility that periodic undulating seabeds at the offshore may decrease the wave energy propagating towards the coastline and protect the beach from energetic wave attack (Guo et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2015;Peng et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The investigations on the Bragg reflection phenomenon can be divided into two categories, that is, the theoretical study of Bragg reflection and its application research in the real coastal engineering. For the theoretical study, the sinusoidal undulating topography was most frequently considered, and various mathematical analysis methodologies were adopted to deduce the analytical solution for Bragg reflection, and the possible mechanism of the phenomenon were systematically revealed (e.g., Davies and Heathershaw (1984); Kar et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2019a); Miles and Chamberlain (1998)). In the aspect of engineering application, considering that Bragg reflection of periodic undulating seabed has significant wave prevention effect, in recent years, many scholars have carried out extensive studies on the influences of the section form, structural size and layout of the undulating seabed on Bragg reflection characteristics; the section forms of the undulating seabed considered mainly include rectangle, rectified cosine, trapezoid, triangle, semicircle, and so on (e.g., Li et al. (2020); Liu (2017); Liu et al. (2019b); Zeng et al. (2017)). Heretofore, the studies on Bragg reflection so far have been mostly confined to a region of periodic undulations set on flat or sloping seabeds, and both the seaward and leeward sides of the region of the periodic undulation were basically the simple horizontal bottom (Davies and Heathershaw, 1984;Kar et al., 2020;Kirby and Anton, 1990;Liu, 2017;Miles and Chamberlain, 1998;Peng et al., 2019;Zeng et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2012).</p>
<p>In coastal and estuarine areas, patches of periodic undulating topographies (such as sandwaves and sandbars) are frequently observed, with the wavelength ranging from a few meters to a few hundred meters (Boczar-Karakiewicz and Davidson-Arnott, 1987;Dolan and Dean, 1985;Elgar, 2003;Guazzelli et al., 1992;Zheng et al., 2016). Hence, the hydrodynamic interactions between the incident waves from the open sea, the periodic undulating topography and the harbor are very common in coastal and estuarine zones (e.g., for the Ponta da Madeira Harbor (Brazil) (Ara√∫jo et al., 2004), East London Harbor (South Africa) (Russell, 1982)), and Kesennuma Harbor (Japan) (Mogi, 1965)). However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the coupling effects between the periodic undulation and the harbor subjected to water surface waves have not yet been investigated so far.</p>
<p>Although it has been widely acknowledged that Bragg reflection can significantly reflect the incident wave energy propagating from the offshore to the coastline when the patch of periodic undulation is set on flat or sloping seabeds, it is still unknow whether the periodic undulating topographies could notably weaken the strength of harbor oscillations if they are in front of the harbor entrance. The occurrence of Bragg resonant reflection can indeed significantly decrease the wave energy propagating into the harbor, which is beneficial to alleviate harbor oscillations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, when it occurs, the patch of periodic undulation could also significantly reflect the radiated waves from the harbor entrance back to the harbor, which would aggravate the intensity of harbor resonance. The specific influence of Bragg reflection on harbor resonance depends on the relative strength between the alleviating and the aggravating effects mentioned above.</p>
<p>Hence, the following four questions arise:</p>
<p>(1) Can the patch of periodic undulating topographies mitigate the strength of the harbor resonance induced directly by the incident regular long waves?</p>
<p>(2) If the answer to question (1) is yes, can the periodic undulating seabed further alleviate the harbor resonance triggered by the incident wave groups?</p>
<p>(3) If the answer to question (2) is yes, what a kind of spatial-scale relationship between the periodic undulating seabed and the incident waves should be satisfied? More specifically, there exist two possible spatial scale relationships: (i) the wavelength of undulating seabed is approximately equal to half of the wavelength of the incident short waves, and (ii) the former is approximately equal to half of the wavelength of the incident wave groups. Which relationship should be satisfied? (4) If both answers to questions (1) and ( 2) are yes, how the geometrical parameters of the periodic undulating topography (including the number and the amplitude) affect the mitigation effect for harbor resonance and the optimal wavelength of the undulating topography that can achieve the best mitigation effect?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, in this article, the interactions between a region of periodic undulating seabed, a harbor and incident steady-state surface waves will be systematically investigated for the first time. The incident steady-state waves considered in the present study include regular long waves and bichromatic short wave groups. The periodic undulating seabed is represented by sinusoidal bars which have been frequently adopted in the study of Bragg reflection (e.g., Davies and Heathershaw (1984); Liu et al. (2019a); Liu et al. (2019b); Miles and Chamberlain (1998)). The generation and propagation of the incident steady-state waves and their interactions with both the sinusoidal bars and the harbor are performed by using a Boussinesq-type numerical model. For simplification, the crest/trough lines of the sinusoidal bars are set to be parallel to and outside the harbor entrance. The harbor is assumed to be long and narrow; the free-surface displacement inside them essentially becomes one-dimensional. Except over the region of periodic undulating seabed, the water depth inside and outside the harbor is set to a constant.</p>
<p>The influences of the sinusoidal bars on the harbor resonance induced by the regular long waves are first examined and the capacity of Bragg reflection to mitigate the strength of harbor resonance is revealed for the first time in this study. Further, the effects of the number and the amplitude of the sinusoidal bars are examined on the mitigation effect for harbor resonance and on the optimal wavelength of the sinusoidal bars that can achieve the best mitigation effect. The lowest four resonant modes of the harbor are considered to reveal the sensitivity of the research findings to the resonant mode. Then, both the capability of Bragg reflection to restrain the harbor resonance induced by the bichromatic short wave groups and what a kind of spatial-scale relationship should be satisfied are proved and determined by setting two sets of sinusoidal bars with different wavelength ranges. How the geometric parameters of the sinusoidal bars affect the strength of harbor resonance and the optimal topographic wavelength is also discussed. However, different from regular long waves, the above discussions are only limited to the lowest resonant mode of the harbor when the bichromatic short wave groups are considered.</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the numerical model, and its abilities to reproduce various hydrodynamic phenomena related to Bragg reflection and harbor resonance are verified by three sets of physical experiments. Section 3 introduces the parameters of the incident waves and illustrates the numerical wave tank as well. Section 4 describes the simulation results along with detailed explanations. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5.</p>
<p>In the article, all numerical experiments are carried out by using the fully nonlinear Boussinesqtype numerical model,
<rs xml:id="12972796" type="software">FUNWAVE</rs>
<rs xml:id="12972797" type="version" corresp="12972796">2.0</rs>, which has been widely used to simulate the wave transformation from the offshore area to the coastline in the community of coastal engineering. It was developed at University of Delaware by Kirby et al. (2003). This numerical model adopts a finite difference scheme to solve the fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations of Wei et al. (1995), and blends a moving reference level as performed in Kennedy et al. (2001).
</p>
<p>The governing equations in
<rs xml:id="12972798" type="software">FUNWAVE</rs>

<p>In these equations, Œ∑, h, t, and g denote the free wave surface, the water depth, the time, and the gravitational acceleration, respectively. uŒ± denotes the vector of the horizontal velocity at a reference elevation zŒ±=Œ±h with Œ±=-0.531. The subscript t denotes the first-order time partial derivative of the corresponding variable. ÔÉë=(‚àÇ/‚àÇx, ‚àÇ/‚àÇy) denotes the horizontal gradient vector.</p>
<p>The wave-making methodology of Chawla and Kirby (2000) is used to generate regular or irregular waves. At the boundaries of the numerical wave tank, sponge layers are arranged to dissipate outgoing waves with different frequencies and directions effectively. With the great improvement in both nonlinearity and dispersion, the numerical model can model the propagation and transformation of the water waves from intermediate depth to coastline accurately and robustly (Bruno et al., 2009;Gao et al., 2018;Kirby et al., 2003).</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, heretofore, the experimental data for the coupling interaction between Bragg reflection and harbor resonance have not yet been reported. Hence, the capability of the present model to reproduce Bragg reflection of water surface waves and to reproduce harbor resonance will be separately validated by using existing laboratory experiments in the following.</p>
<p>The validation for Bragg reflection is shown in subsection 2.2.1. The verifications for harbor resonance are presented in subsections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 where the linear harbor resonance and the nonlinear harbor resonance are respectively reproduced.</p>
<p>To examine the ability of
<rs xml:id="12972800" type="software">FUNWAVE</rs>
<rs xml:id="12972801" type="version" corresp="12972800">2.0</rs> in simulating Bragg reflection excited by water surface waves, this model is used to reproduce the laboratory experiments of Davies and Heathershaw (1984). The experiments were carried out in a glass-walled wave tank with the dimensions of 45.72 m √ó 0.91 m √ó 0.91 m. A patch of sinusoidal bars with the wavelength of S= 1.0 m was built into a false bottom in the tank. Based on their experiments, the setup of the numerical wave tank used is shown in Fig. 1, where D and N respectively denote the amplitude and the number of sinusoidal bars. Ls=NS denotes the total spatial length of the patch of bars whose left and right boundaries are respectively marked out by the symbols "BL" and "BR". The length of the numerical wave tank is set to 42 m, slightly shorter than that of the physical tank. The grid size is 0.02 m, and sponge layers with the width of 6 m are deployed at both sides to absorb the reflected and the transmitted waves. Two wave gauges (i.e., G1 and G2) are placed in front of the bars to calculate the reflection coefficient, Cr, according to the two-point method proposed by Goda and Suzuki (1976).
</p>
<p>Two physical experiments with different bar numbers and water depths are reproduced here, and their specific parameters are listed in Table 1. In Tests 1 and 2, the numbers of bars are 4 and 10, respectively; the water depths are 0.156 m and 0.313 m, respectively. The amplitude of bars is D=0.05 m in both tests. For each test, a series of cases with various wavelengths of the incident regular waves are simulated, and all cases are run for 80 wave periods. The time series of the free-surface elevations for the last 30 waves recorded by G1 and G2 are selected for analyses.</p>
<p>In this subsection, the classical resonance problem in an elongated harbor is considered. The ratio of the incident wave amplitude and the water depth is quite small so that the harbor response is linear. The purpose of performing the test for the linear harbor resonance is to validate the ability of the model for accurately estimating the resonant frequencies and the resonant wave amplitudes for various modes. and Goda (1963) and Lee (1971). Lw and l denote the width of the wave-making zone and the length of the harbor, respectively. Ippen and Goda (1963) and Lee (1971) always set to be one wavelength of the incident waves. A wave gauge is deployed at the center of the backwall of the harbor (i.e., the point A). Based on the experimental data, the incident wave amplitude, a, is set to 0.003 m, and hence it can be seen that the wave nonlinearity is quite small (a/h=0.01).</p>
<p>Fig. 4 presents the comparison of the present simulation results and experimental data. The linear analytical solution of Mei (1983) is also plotted here. For the lowest two resonant modes, their resonant frequencies predicted by the present model are in quite agreement with both the linear analytical solution and the experimental data. As for the resonant wave amplitudes, the simulated results also coincide well with the experimental measurements for both resonant modes overall. This proves that the
<rs xml:id="12972802" type="software">FUNWAVE</rs>
<rs xml:id="12972803" type="version" corresp="12972802">2.0</rs> model can predict the resonant frequencies and the resonant wave amplitudes accurately for various modes. Rogers and Mei (1978) carried out experiments in a physical wave tank to investigate the nonlinear oscillations of three bays (Bay 1, Bay 2, and Bay 3) whose lengths are l=0.37 m, 1.27 m, and 2.18 m, respectively. The widths of the three bays are uniform and equal to b=0.10 m, and the water depth is h=0.15 m. The regular waves with a period of 1.545 s (correspondingly, with the wavelength of 1.79 m) were produced by the wavemaker. The incident regular waves with the wave height H/h=0.03 are generated in the internal wavemaker to reproduce parts of the laboratory experiments. The grid size Œîx is a constant of 0.01 m both inside and outside the harbor except in the sponge layer where Œîx gradually increase from 0.01 m to 0.10 m. The grid size ‚àÜy gradually increases from 0.01 m inside the harbor to 0.07 m outside the harbor. Fig. 6 shows the comparisons of the simulated results of the first three super harmonics with the experimental data for the three bays. It can be easily seen that, for all the three bays and for all three super harmonics, the numerical results are in good coincidence with the measured data overall. This shows that the numerical model can well simulate the nonlinear energy transfer between various harmonic components during harbor resonance.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that for the nonlinear harbor resonance induced by the bichromatic short wave groups (it will be elaborated in Section 3), its generation mechanism is essentially the transfer of wave energy from the short wave components to the 2 nd -order difference-frequency (subharmonic) component. The good performance of the present model in modeling nonlinear wave energy transfer between various harmonic components during harbor resonance guarantees that the nonlinear harbor resonance excited by the bichromatic wave groups can also be accurately simulated by the present model. Rogers and Mei (1978) and simulated results with for (a) Bay 1, (b) Bay 2, and (c) Bay 3. ‚Ä¢, fundamental harmonic; ‚ñ≤, second harmonic; ‚óÜ, third harmonic; -, simulated results.</p>
<p>The harbor oscillations triggered by two kinds of incident steady-state waves (i.e., regular long waves and bichromatic short wave groups) are investigated in the present study. Hence, the parameters for these two kinds of incident waves are separately presented in subsections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.</p>
<p>In this article, an elongated rectangular harbor with the length of l=20 m, the width of b=2 m and a constant water depth of h0=1 m is considered. Based on the linear analytical solution of Mei (1983), the amplification factor curve at the center of the backwall is calculated and presented in Fig. 7. It is seen that the lowest five resonant frequencies for the harbor are 0.035 Hz, 0.108 Hz, 0.180 Hz, 0.249 Hz, and 0.313 Hz. Because the lowest four resonant modes are investigated for the harbor resonance excited directly by regular long waves, the frequencies of the incident regular waves are set equal to the lowest four resonant frequencies. The incident wave height is H=0.02 m for all cases. Specific wave parameters for the harbor resonance triggered directly by the incident regular long waves are listed in Table 2. Ti and Li in the table refer to the period and the wavelength of the incident waves with the frequency fi (i=1, 2, 3 and 4), and Li is determined according to the linear dispersion relation. Table 2. Specific parameters of both the incident waves and the sinusoidal bars for the harbor resonance triggered directly by regular long waves. Ti and Li denotes the period and the wavelength of the incident waves with the frequency fi (i=1, 2, 3 and 4), and the latter (Li) for different resonant modes vary over a wide range (see Table 2), the length of the computational domain outside the harbor is designed according to the incident wavelength for each mode and is equal to 9.5Li. While the width of the wave tank for all the four resonant modes is always set to 20 m. In the xand the y-directions, two uniform grid sizes, Œîx=0.25 m and Œîy=0.20 m, are utilized in the whole computational domain. For each resonant modes, the total time of 60 wave periods is simulated, and the time step of Œît=0.03 s is adopted. Twenty-one wave gauges (G1-G21) are deployed equidistantly along the central line of the harbor, and the distance between adjacent gauges is 1.0 m.</p>
<p>Gauges G1 and G21 are placed at the backwall and the entrance of the harbor, respectively.</p>
<p>For the harbor oscillations excited by the bichromatic short wave groups, only the first resonant mode of the harbor is considered. To answer the questions (2) and (3) raised in the Introduction, two types (i.e., long-bar type and short-bar type) of sinusoidal bars are taken into considerations here (see Table 3). For the long-bar type topography, all setups about the wave tank are identical to those adopted in simulating the first resonant mode induced by regular long waves, except that the bichromatic short wave groups are simulated here. While for the short-bar type topography, the setups about the wave tank are identical to those for the long-bar type topography, except that the spatial scale of the short bars is designed according to the wavelength of the incident short waves, Œ∂, rather than to the wavelength of the free long waves, L1.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that N=0 means no sinusoidal bar existing outside the harbor. In other words, only the pure harbor resonance process is simulated. The purposes of considering the cases with N=0 lies in constructing the comparative group for the cases with N&gt;0.</p>
<p>The time series of the wave surfaces and the spatial distribution of the wave amplitudes inside the harbor subjected to both the regular long waves and the bichromatic short wave groups are first analyzed in subsection 4.1 by using various data analysis techniques. Based on the analysis results in subsection 4.1, the effects of Bragg reflection on the harbor oscillations excited by the incident regular long waves are discussed in subsection 4.2. Finally, all the analysis results related to the influences of Bragg reflection on the harbor resonance triggered by the incident bichromatic short wave groups are presented in subsection 4.3. Based on the time series of the free-surface elevations during the steady-state process, the mean zero-up-crossing wave amplitudes at all gauges are calculated, and their spatial distributions inside the harbor for the eight cases in Fig. 9 are further illustrated in Fig. 10. It is noted that the spatial distributions of the wave amplitude are normalized by A * 1 that denotes the response amplitude at gauge G1 for the no-bar topography. For comparison, the analytical amplitude distribution based on Mei (1983)'s solution for each resonant mode is also plotted here. Three phenomena can be easily observed. Firstly, for all the four cases with N=0, because there is no bar outside the harbor, the amplitude distributions simulated by the numerical model coincides well with the analytical ones of Mei (1983), which indicates again the accuracy of the present numerical model in simulating the harbor resonance phenomenon.</p>
<p>Secondly, because of the total reflection at the backwall of the harbor, there always exist a maximum value of the response amplitudes there, no matter whether the patch of bars exists or not.</p>
<p>Hence, considering the significance of the response amplitude at gauge G1, the ratio of the response amplitude at gauge G1 for N&gt;0 (denoted by A1) to that for N=0 (denoted by A * 1) will be used as a measure to quantitatively assess the effect of sinusoidal bars on the harbor resonance.</p>
<p>Thirdly, for the four resonant modes, the response amplitudes inside the harbor for the cases with N=6 are shown to be always lower than the corresponding ones for the cases with N=0 to different degrees. To illustrate this point quantitatively, the amplitude ratios, A1/ A * 1, for all the four x/l resonant modes are listed in Table 4. It is seen that for Modes 1 and 2, the amplitude ratios are 69.99% and 67.77%, which indicates that the intensity of the harbor resonance are reduced by about 30% due to the external sinusoidal bars. For Modes 3 and 4, the amplitude ratios decrease to 31.54% and 32.94%, respectively. This illustrates that more than 70% of the resonant amplitude inside the harbor is suppressed for these two resonant modes. Based on the limited information presented in Fig. 10 and Table 4, it seems that Bragg resonant reflection can effectively alleviate the harbor resonance for various modes induced by the regular long waves. More comprehensive results and discussions on the effects of Bragg reflection on the harbor oscillations excited by the regular long waves will be presented in subsection 4.2.</p>
<p>The technique of Morlet wavelet transform is adopted here to reveal both time-and frequencydomain information from the time series of the free-surface elevation.</p>
<p>Mode 1 energy enters the harbour. However, the radiated waves are mostly cylindrical with respect to the origin at the harbor entrance. They propagate with a variable direction with the bars and are not in the optimal condition for Bragg reflection. Furthermore, the radiated waves reflected by the bars do not go back directly into the harbor, but more likely attack the surrounding coastline.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sinusoidal bars tend to intensify harbor oscillations when 2S/Li is approximately larger than 1.15. Under this condition, the alleviating effect of the periodic bars becomes weaker than its aggravating effect. Thirdly, both the minimum value of A1/A * 1 (denoted by the symbol "(A1/A * 1)m" hereinafter) and its corresponding value of 2S/Li (called as the optimal normalized wavelength of the undulating topography and denoted by the symbol "(2S/Li)m") for each set of N, D and the resonant mode are closely related to the geometrical parameters of the bars and to the resonant mode. More detailed discussions on how the geometrical parameters of the bars and the resonant mode affect them will be shown in subsections 4.2.2-4.2.4.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the value of (A1/A*1)m can quantitatively embody the mitigation effect of Bragg reflection on the harbor resonance induced directly by regular long waves, and that a lower 2019)). Secondly, the value of (2S/Li)m is shown to gradually increase with the increase of N, which is also consistent with the theoretical finding of Liu et al. (2019a) for pure Bragg reflection (see Table 2 in Liu et al. (2019a)). These two phenomena indicate that Bragg resonant reflection plays a dominant role in the coupling interactions between the patch of sinusoidal bars and the harbor. 1, the variation range of (2S/Li)m is from 0.70 to 0.95, and the difference between the upper and the lower limits is 0.25; while for Mode 4, its variation range is from 0.90 to 1.0, and the difference between the upper and the lower limits is only 0.10. It can be qualitatively explained as follows. For both Modes 1 and 2, their intensities of harbor oscillations are significantly stronger than those of Modes 3 and 4 (see Fig. 7). Therefore, the energy of the radiated waves for the former two modes are much higher than that for the latter two modes; the modulatory effects of the radiated waves on Bragg reflection for the former two modes are significantly stronger those for the latter two modes.</p>
<p>Hence, it well explains why (2S/Li)m deviates from 1.0 more notably and is more sensitive to N for Modes 1 and 2. 18). On the contrary, (2S/Li)m is shown to increase with the resonant mode overall, although there also are some fluctuations for D/h0=0.3 and 0.4 (see Fig. 19). It means that the value of (2S/Li)m becomes closer to 1.0 as the resonant mode rises, which is consistent with the related finding in Fig. 15. In view of the effectiveness of the long-bar type topography on mitigating nonlinear harbor 11 oscillations, the discussions will focus only on this type of topography. 12 13 N, for the long-bar type topography. It is seen that for (AL1/A*L1)m (Fig. 21a), its value declines with the increase of the bar number overall, which indicates that the mitigation effect of Bragg reflection on the nonlinear harbor oscillations becomes better and better as N rises. This phenomenon is similar to that shown in Fig. 14 where the harbor resonance triggered by regular long waves is concerned.</p>
<p>For (2S/L1)m (Fig. 21b), its value is shown to increase gradually with the increase of N and its variation range is from 0.80 to 1.0, which is like the phenomenon illustrated in Fig. 15.</p>
<p>In this article, the coupling interactions between the incident steady-state waves, the harbor, and the patch of sinusoidal bars outside the harbor are studied for the first time by utilizing the fully nonlinear Boussinesq model,
<rs xml:id="12972804" type="software">FUNWAVE</rs>
<rs xml:id="12972805" type="version" corresp="12972804">2.0</rs>. The incident steady-state waves considered include regular long waves and bichromatic short wave groups. Correspondingly, two kinds of harbor oscillations, that is, the harbor resonance triggered directly by the regular long waves and the nonlinear harbor resonance induced by the bichromatic short wave groups, are studied in the present study. For the first kind of harbor oscillations, the effects of the sinusoidal bars on the lowest four resonant modes are systematically investigated. For the second kind, two types of bar topographies (i.e., the long-bar and the short-bar types) are studied, and only the lowest resonant mode of the harbor is studied. The capability of Bragg reflection to alleviate both kinds of harbor oscillations is revealed first. Subsequently, the effects of the geometrical parameters (including the number and the amplitude of bars) on the best mitigation effect for harbor resonance and on the optimal wavelength of bars that can achieve the best mitigation effect are comprehensively investigated. The results of the current research have broadened the knowledge on the harbor oscillations excited by the steady-state wave conditions.
</p>
<p>The following main conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study:</p>
<p>(1) The patch of periodic bar topographies can remarkably mitigate the harbor oscillations induced directly by the regular long waves when Bragg resonant reflection occurs. Under this condition, the alleviating effect of the periodic bars resulting from the remarkable reflection of the incident (5) Based on the investigations for the pure Bragg reflection, it has been found that not only the sinusoidal bars but also the artificial bars with other section forms (e.g., rectangle, trapezoid, and triangle) can result in the Bragg resonant reflection. Hence, it can be reasonably inferred that, like the sinusoidal bars, these artificial bars are probably capable of alleviating harbor oscillations. Compared to the sinusoidal bars, these artificial bars are more suitable for the actual engineering because they are easier to be manufactured. However, the mitigation effect of these artificial bars needs to be further investigated in the future.</p>

<p>AL1/A * L1 is 77.0% (see Fig. 20h). 1 2 waves are always stronger than its aggravating effect caused by the reflection of the radiated waves back into the harbor, which indicates that Bragg resonant reflection always dominates the coupling process. On the other hand, the radiated waves from the harbor entrance also play a modulation role to a certain extent, especially for the lowest two resonant modes of the harbor.</p>
<p>(2) When Bragg resonant reflection occurs, the alleviating effect of the sinusoidal bars on the harbor resonance excited by regular long waves is linearly enhanced as the number or the amplitude of bars increases. The optimal normalized wavelength of bars denoted by (2S/Li)m (i=1, 2, 3, and 4) is not always exactly equal to 1.0. For most cases, its value is less than 1.0. Moreover, the value of (2S/Li)m is shown to gradually increase with the bar number, regardless of the resonant mode of the harbor. However, the effect of the bar amplitude on (2S/Li)m depends closely on the resonant mode. For Mode 1, the increase of the amplitude tends to cause the increase of (2S/Li)m; while for Modes 2-4, the rise of the amplitude is inclined to decrease the value of (2S/Li)m.</p>
<p>(3) The long-bar type topography has the capacity of alleviating the nonlinear harbor oscillations induced by the bichromatic short wave groups effectively when Bragg resonant reflection occurs. In the variation ranges of the parameters of the long-bar type topography considered, the strength of the nonlinear harbor oscillations can be weakened by up to 76.4%. However, for the short-bar type topography, its capability of mitigating the nonlinear harbor resonance is limited. In the ranges of the parameters of the short-bar type topography, the strength of the nonlinear harbor oscillations can be weakened only by 23.0%.</p>
<p>(4) Like the harbor resonance triggered directly by the regular long waves, the alleviating effect of the long-bar type topography on the nonlinear harbor resonance induced by the bichromatic wave groups becomes better and better as the number or the amplitude of bars increases, and the optimal normalized wavelength of the long-bar type topography denoted by (2S/L1)m also increases gradually with the number of bars. However, (2S/L1)m is always shown to fluctuate with the amplitude of bars around certain values that depend on the number of bars.</p>
<p>(5) For most cases, the optimal normalized wavelength of bars is less than 1.0, rather than exactly equal to 1.0, no matter for the harbor resonance triggered directly by the regular long waves or the nonlinear harbor resonance induced by the bichromatic wave groups. This downward shift of the optimal normalized wavelength of bars is consistent with the related finding in the investigations of the pure Bragg reflection phenomenon.</p>
<p>We reaffirm here that the above-mentioned conclusions are only valid for the given harbor, incident wave parameters and resonant modes, and the variation ranges of the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal bars considered in this article.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the following implications can be obtained in the practice:</p>
<p>(1) To mitigate the long-period resonance in a built harbor is very tough and expensive (Lee and Xing, 2009). Alteration of the general layout is one option, but sometimes it seems impossible, especially for a built harbor. The present research proposes a new option: to change the bottom profile to use the Bragg reflection to mitigate the harbor resonance, which is much more feasible as long as the navigating depth is guaranteed.</p>
<p>(2) If there are natural bars at the location of a harbor to be built, the possible countermeasure and its mitigation effect on harbor resonance depend on the wavelength of the natural bars. For the bar wavelength, S, with the order of tens of meters to hundreds of meters, the general layout of the harbor needs to be carefully designed based on the following principle. That is, the wavelength of the incident long waves that correspond to the most destructive resonant mode, Li, should approach the value of (2S/Li)m as closely as possible. In general, to meet the above principle, a trial-and-error designing process is inevitable.</p>
<p>(3) For the natural bars with the wavelength ranging only from meters to more than ten meters, the natural bars should be artificially modified (if needed) so that their wavelength approaches the value of (2S/Œ∂)m as closely as possible. (2S/Œ∂)m denotes the optimal normalized wavelength of the short-type bars that can achieve (AL1/A * L1)m (refer to Fig. 20e-h). Œ∂ here corresponds to the short wavelength of the spectral peak period. This countermeasure could also alleviate the harbor resonance to a certain extent, although its mitigation effect is not as good as that of the above-mentioned long-type bars with much longer wavelengths.</p>
<p>(4) For built harbors without natural bars, the artificial bars could be arranged outside the harbor entrance. The designing principles of the artificial bars are similar to those presented in the implications (1) and (2) and are not repeated here. Compared to the natural bars, the artificial bars are more suitable for small-scale harbors (e.g., the marina). This is because, for large-scale harbors, if the relationship of (2S/Li)m was satisfied, the value of S might be too large to make</p>
