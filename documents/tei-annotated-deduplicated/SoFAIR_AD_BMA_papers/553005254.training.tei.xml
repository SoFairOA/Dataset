<p>The conceptualization of the stakeholders of the companies for the fulfillment of the objectives of sustainable development is controversial, even more so, if it is approached from the perspective of corporate social responsibility and the psychology of the employees and their behavior. The existing literature and knowledge on the relationship among the stakeholder approach, corporate social responsibility and the achievement of the SDGs remain unstructured and fragmented. The objective of the manuscript is to identify and systematize scientific research on the stakeholder approach with respect to corporate social responsibility, in order to achieve business sustainability, in response to sustainable development goals and from the perspective of the well-being of workers. Our main contribution to the literature review is to focus on all these issues together, and not in isolation. A systematic literature search is conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). The approaches, issues and methodologies that predominate in the academic field in the last 5 years (2015-2021) were analyzed. Based on this review, we define a research agenda that synthesizes key trends and promising lines of research for further advancement of theoretical and empirical knowledge on the relationship among stakeholders, corporate social responsibility, and human resource management.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has represented a significant challenge for companies, which, for the most part, have had to adapt due to the changing conditions generated by the pandemic in a short period of time (Kraus et al., 2020). It is essential that companies define strategies that allow them to adapt to changing realities and that provide them with sustainable differentiation from other competitors (Orviz Martínez et al., 2021;Ullah et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The success of companies depends on the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in their business models, which guarantee better financial performance (Khediri, 2021;Lee et al., 2018).</p>
<p>CSR plays a fundamental role, which has evolved and encompassed an increasingly broader panorama (Morej on &amp; Lorenzo, 2020), it requires not only changes in strategies, but also changes in structures and thoughts applied in the company and guided by a growth guideline and continuous feedback with the environment.</p>
<p>The contemporary company, to achieve the objectives in a general way, must advocate for the quality of the relationship with its stakeholders, since this represents a key factor that harms, or benefits, the success of the company (Baric, 2017). Workers are the most relevant stakeholders of the company, therefore, special attention must be paid, since they are determining agents in the implementation of the strategy and it is they who perceive, or not, the existence of CSR practices that companies design and their impact (Correa, 2007). The study by Saz-Gil et al. (2020) shows the existence of a close interaction between the internal social responsibility of the company and the learning capacities of the workers. So we ask ourselves: Is it possible to improve the health of workers and a healthy and committed behavior on their part, if the deficiencies or weaknesses given in CSR decrease? This question leads us directly to link CSR with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular with SDGs 3, 8 and 16.</p>
<p>However, previous research on stakeholders and corporate social responsibility (Achahuanco &amp; Fuentes, 2019;Gamarra, 2018), coincides with the fact that business strategies are not usually related to the SDGs as necessary. Therefore, it is worth asking: To what extent does corporate social responsibility contribute to greater fulfillment of the sustainable development objectives?</p>
<p>Taking into account that, as a consequence of covid 19, many of the actions to comply with the SDGs have been affected or have not been developed on the scheduled dates, it is interesting to deepen into the matter.</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go, and it is urgent to arouse political will and develop concrete and realistic projects that build bridges between theory and practice (Gorrochategui et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Our proposal carries out a review of the literature on the relationship between the stakeholder approach, corporate social responsibility. and the achievement of sustainable development goals from the workers' perspective. To do this, we face a double perspective: (1) on the one hand, how the existence of the stakeholder approach in the company allows it to orient itself to a commitment to corporate social responsibility and progress in achieving the SDGs (2) on the other hand, how in this context and from the perspective of the workers the progress of the company towards sustainability is increased. The conceptualization of the stakeholders of the companies for the fulfillment of the objectives of sustainable development is controversial, even more so, if it is approached from the perspective of corporate social responsibility and from the psychology of the employees and their behavior. The existing literature and knowledge on the relationship among the stakeholder approach, corporate social responsibility and the achievement of the SDGs remain unstructured and fragmented. The objective of the manuscript is to identify and systematize scientific research on the stakeholder approach with respect to corporate social responsibility, in order to achieve business sustainability, in response to sustainable development goals and from the perspective of the well-being of workers. Our main contribution to the literature review is to focus on all these issues together, and not in isolation. We add new evidence to a current field of research on the stakeholder approach, corporate social responsibility and sustainability from the perspective of worker well-being.</p>
<p>Finally, our study offers future lines of research on how they are developing and how they could be improved.</p>
<p>2.1 | Stakeholder and CSR approach to achieve the SDGs Clarkson (1995) identifies the stakeholder, in a generic way, as the person or group that has claims, properties, rights or interests in the organization and in its past, present or future activities. According to Donaldson and Preston (1995), the stakeholder's theory can be formulated through four hypotheses on which it is baseddescriptive, instrumental or strategic, normative and managerialand which constitute the characteristic features of the theory. The Theory of Stakeholders (Freeman, 1984), considers that organizations are composed of a set of participants, which he calls interest groups (stakeholders), and among which usually include: shareholders, workers, funders, suppliers, clients, administration, and society in general. From this perspective, the company appears as the result of the interrelation of all these groups over time (diachronic process). Various authors have established stakeholder classification criteria considering their relevance in the organization (Freeman, 1984;Mitchell et al., 1997). However, it is necessary to adopt a contingent vision when identifying and involving the various stakeholders in each organization (Rodríguez, 2006).</p>
<p>For companies to meet their obligations under the ethics of responsibility, stakeholders must receive relevant, timely and understandable information about their activities through corporate reports (Clayton et al., 2015). Most companies recognize legal obligations to employees, customers, suppliers, managers, and the government. The latter should remain involved in business dynamics in terms of CSR (Popkova et al., 2021) and favor its institutionalization in all companies. Studies confirm divergences between companies, some do not establish any plan to involve interested parties (Salvini et al., 2018), small companies engage more with interested parties compared to medium-sized companies (Ocampo L opez et al., 2016).</p>
<p>The social responsibility of the company is based on the commitment with the interested parties for the achievement of corporate sustainability (Tworzydło et al., 2021). Cultural and structural factors, the values of the organization, management style, empowerment and teamwork should be considered together, when adopting a CSR strategy, especially if it is aimed at developing innovative behavior (Revuelta-Taboada et al. 2021). Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a business trend of necessary application (Botero Pérez &amp; Franco Acosta, 2016). CSR presents many nuances that are being incorporated into the state of the art, it analyzes the social actions of the private sector as complementary interventions to the state's work (Correa, 2007). Companies are aware of their contribution to the creation of a better society (Fern andez, 2015) and of their responsibility towards the environment, employees and multiple stakeholders (Andreu Pinillos et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Due to the multidisciplinary origin of CSR (Aguascalientes &amp; Medero G omez, 2016;Correa, 2007), companies that have strategic conversations between different interested parties, have great possibilities of experiencing fewer gaps in the perceptions of their mission and values (Miles et al., 2006).</p>
<p>However, there is a serious risk that stakeholder actions erode CSR over time and therefore sustainability (Strand et al., 2015). Ultimately, the sustainability of management approaches such as CSR, depend on its position in society (Steurer et al., 2005), if a coherent relationship between the company and its stakeholders is achieved, it would have a positive impact on the value of the company (Ifada et al., 2021).</p>
<p>However, multiple United Nations reports (UN, 2015;2018;2019) show great challenges and inequalities between countries (Sanahuja, 2015) and make companies responsible. In this context, CSR is a necessary condition for the achievement of business sustainability, at the same time that it leads to a balanced situation, in which everyone wins (Bian et al., 2021). The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs (UN, 2015) represent a new scenario of action for companies (Sanahuja, 2015), they provide an opportunity to address systemic challenges (Fern andez, 2015).</p>
<p>In correspondence with SDG 3, 8, 16, 12 (UN, 2015) and in a complex context, due to the characteristics of work and the transitory nature of contemporary employment, researchers on the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development, point out the importance of CSR in the organizational orientation towards the well-being of employees (Pérez et al., 2018).</p>
<p>CSR responds to the demand for practices that affect employee health and productivity at work (Jenny et al., 2020). Unwanted working conditions are problematic for the health, well-being and productivity of employees. In general, it is the employees themselves who report undesirable working conditions, which lead to poor health (Crizzle et al., 2018). Responsible job design, good communication and team building have positive and significant effects and are interpreted as the essence of internal social responsibility and the first step to build external social responsibility (S anchez-Hern andez et al., 2020). It is observed that socially responsible management in employees can improve organizational behavior (Shao et al., 2019). As there is a positive relationship between socially responsible employees and the sense of work, which allows them to perform their tasks without harm to health (L opez-Fern andez et al., 2018;Luu, 2021).</p>
<p>External factors must be taken into account, for example, the economic crisis caused by covid 19, is a stress factor that can worsen working conditions. Thus, the implications in the evaluation of psychosocial risk in turbulent times should not be ignored (Giorgi et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The health of workers and the performance of the organization are effective means to meet the needs of the company and improve the well-being of workers (Harvey, 2019). From the perspective of occupational health that considers contextual factors as risk factors for occupational stress (economic uncertainty, robotization, unemployment, etc.), the mediating effects of organizational orientation on the well-being of employees should be examined (Giorgi et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The subjective value of CSR strategies perceived by the employee in the performance of their daily work has a positive influence on both their job satisfaction and their willingness to use negotiation to overcome possible problems and maintain the long-term employment relationship (Clipa et al., 2019). While job insecurity is negatively related to health and job satisfaction (Giunchi et al., 2019). The perceived CSR of an organization can develop a sense of trust among employees and, in turn, lead to the construction of corporate reputation (Yadav et al., 2018). Prosperity at work is a psychological state in which employees experience a sense of vitality (Abid et al., 2018). Since, although the literature has explored the positive effects of socially responsible management of employees, potential dark sides have been largely ignored, as expressed in (Shao et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Scientific literature shows that corporate commitment to CSR positively influences the level of sustainable performance of companies (Mallah &amp; Jaaron, 2021). The role of employees is potentially vital when it comes to addressing the new challenges that companies face and carrying out initiatives within the framework of corporate sustainability (Revuelta-Taboada et al. 2021). The mediating role of employee engagement is evidenced in high-performance work systems, which allow the organization to retain and satisfy its employees, in addition to positively influencing sustainability indicators (Alafeshat &amp; Tanova, 2019). Leaders who advocate for CSR, and do not resist changes, are able to get the best out of their followers, by increasing intrinsic motivation, psychological empowerment (Khusanova et al., 2019). On the contrary, the improvised leadership of the administrative has a negative impact on the work commitment and the well-being of the subordinates, by inducing the employees to have a pro-organization, unethical behavior (Gigol, 2020).</p>
<p>The research constitutes a systematic review of the literature of a quantitative type or meta-analysis (PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009). The year 2015 has been considered as starting point for the meta-analysis as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were approved in September 2015 (United Nations, 2015). The sequence of stages to follow for the elaboration of the investigation is collected in a 4-phase flow diagram. This systematic review is carried out with the objective of finding, selecting, analyzing and systematizing the evidence presented by a series of recent investigations on the orientation followed by stakeholders (clients, vendors, governments, employees, etc.) regarding social responsibility of the companies (CSR) and its influence in the achievement of healthy companies and in the fulfillment of the SDGs. To carry out the search, the <rs xml:id="12966475" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966476" type="software">Scopus</rs> (1) articles written in a non-English language; (2) studies in abstract form, book or book chapters, editorials, opinion pieces.</p>
<p>In the search carried out in the <rs xml:id="12966477" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966478" type="software">Scopus</rs> databases, 278 potentially relevant articles were identified, published from 2015 to date. Specifically, 152 studies were found on the <rs xml:id="12966479" type="software">Web of Science</rs> and 126 on <rs xml:id="12966480" type="software">Scopus</rs>. Three of the studies were eliminated because they were duplicates. The first analysis was carried out on 275 and 181 of them were excluded, once the exclusion criteria had been analyzed.</p>
<p>Ninety-four articles were selected to assess their eligibility. Seventyseven of the 94 were excluded, because they were articles that did not constitute an analysis of the literature. These steps left 17 studies to be finally analyzed. This process is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<p>After a review of the titles and abstracts using explicit criteria, the total remained at 17. Table 2 shows the main characteristics of these articles.</p>
<p>Table 3 shows the analysis of the documents obtained from the search, specifically the number of publications per year in the last Regarding the analysis by countries, 49 countries have been found that have published works on the research topic in the <rs xml:id="12966481" type="software">Wos</rs> and 51 countries that have done so in <rs xml:id="12966482" type="software">Scopus</rs>, of which ten countries, at least, have made five publications in the <rs xml:id="12966483" type="software">Wos</rs> and 16 countries in <rs xml:id="12966484" type="software">Scopus</rs>. In the <rs xml:id="12966485" type="software">Wos</rs>, the USA stands out, with 24 publications, followed by China with 22 and Spain with 20, while in <rs xml:id="12966486" type="software">Scopus</rs> the following countries stand out: United Kingdom with 28 publications and Germany and United States with 15 respectively (Table 4).</p>
<p>In relation to the journals that have disseminated the subject the most, in the case of <rs xml:id="12966487" type="software">Wos</rs>, 109 journals have been found, of which only five have made at least five publications. Among the three magazines that have published the most on the subject are Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, Social Responsibility Journal and Journal of Cleaner Production, with a total of 34 publications among the three. In the case of <rs xml:id="12966488" type="software">Scopus</rs>, 89 magazines have been found that have published on the subject, of which only four have made at least four publications. In this case, Sustainability Switzerland, the Journal of Cleaner Production, and the Journal of Critical Reviews stand out with 31 publications among the three (Table 5).</p>
<p>Regarding productivity by authors, Table 6 shows the ten most productive authors. In the <rs xml:id="12966489" type="software">Wos</rs>, 359 authors were identified, of which only two have at least three publications, Garcia-Sanchez being the author with the highest number of publications (5). In the case of <rs xml:id="12966490" type="software">Scopus</rs> out of a total of 160 authors, only Camilleri has at least three publications.</p>
<p>As for the co-occurrence analysis, this shows us the consistency of the relationship of the main research topics, in the identified investigations, from the searches carried out in the <rs xml:id="12966491" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966492" type="software">Scopus</rs> databases. Sixteen and twenty keywords were identified in the scientific literature in the databases used, which were related to our research topic, in which the occurrence was measured, in terms of the number of times of appearance in the results of the searches carried out and TITLE-ABS-KEY("no binary" OR "Corporate Stakeholders" Or "Stakeholders") AND ("Corporate Social Responsibility" Or "Healthy Business") AND (limit-to (pubyear, 2021) or limit-to (pubyear, 2020) or limit-to (pubyear, 2019) or limit-to (pubyear, 2018) or limit-to (pubyear, 2017) or limit-to (pubyear, 2016) or limit-to (pubyear, 2015)) and (limit-to [oa, "all"]) and (limit-to (doctype, "re") (Adib et al., 2020) He argues that the adoption of stakeholder theory is a key objective to reframe, organize and guide the debate on the consequences of CSR on business performance CSR model (Sadovska et al., 2020) It reveals that there are few companies, which have strategies for long-term activities, such as collaboration with external stakeholders. This highlights the complexity of creating sustainable business value Systematic bibliographic review (Gomez-Carrasco et al., 2020) They argue that studies of CSR events, reported by companies and interested parties on social media, confirm the results of "side-by-side" conversations and the absence of similarities on CSR issues Content analysis the total strength of the link, specifically, taking into account the importance of these words, in each of the researchers studied (Table 7).</p>
<p>In order to analyze the consistency of the main research topics, a co-occurrence analysis was carried out with metadata from <rs xml:id="12966493" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966494" type="software">Scopus</rs>. In the <rs xml:id="12966495" type="software">Wos</rs>: sustainability, financial performance, impact, performance, stakeholder's engagement, disclourse, reputation, governance, satakeholder theory, strategies, industry, engagement, firm performance, stakeholders, corporate social responsibility, sustainability development and business .</p>
<p>In Figure 3, the clusters of the different study topics are visualized for <rs xml:id="12966496" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966497" type="software">Scopus</rs> respectively. Each graph represents the cooccurrence map by labels, taking into account that the size of the circle will be larger, the greater the number of citations a term has.</p>
<p>The colors identify the different thematic groups. For the <rs xml:id="12966498" type="software">Wos</rs> the main cluster can be seen in the central area, in red, addressing those studies on identification of models, strategies and framework about corporate social responsibility. The second cluster, colored green, shows studies on sustainability strategies and financial performance.</p>
<p>The light blue clusters reflect the impact of stakeholder's management, corporate reputation and social media, for corporate social responsibility. Finally, the yellow tones reflect the relationship between governance, firm, owner ship and performance. In graph 3, the main cluster appears again in the central area, but in yellow, and addresses the research on stakeholders and sustainability, relating them to supply chain management. The second cluster, in red, displays research related to corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting. The third cluster, in green, shows the relationship of sustainable development with decision-making, with the economy and social effects and the stakeholder. Finally, in the fourth cluster, light blue, the investigations that address the conceptual farmework and humans.</p>
<p>Based on the bibliographic review carried out, a research agenda is proposed and a comprehensive vision of the relationship between the different concepts that lead to business sustainability is offered.</p>
<p>The ethical choices of companies are influenced by individual values, internal control systems and external institutions. Companies often resort to legitimation strategies to report negative incidents (Rudkin et al., 2019). In addition, a weak regulatory environment, combined with profitability losses, increases the willingness to unethical organizational behavior (Ullah et al., 2019). In particular, multinationals from emerging economies, such as those in Latin America, should reconsider their CSR policies and practices in line with those of companies from developed countries (Akhtar et al., 2020). 5.2 | Reasons for regional differences</p>
<p>As our previous review has shown, there are clear regional differences in studies on company sustainability. In particular, the Latin American area is deficient in studies that address business sustainability (Crane &amp; Glozer, 2016;Lizarzaburu &amp; Del Brio, 2016;Ocampo L opez et al., 2016;Sierra-García et al., 2014;Ullah &amp; Sun, 2021)</p>
<p>The review carried out shows that some of the companies do not have plans that involve the interested parties to achieve their objectives. Therefore, it is ignored that CSR is based on the commitment of stakeholders to achieve business sustainability (Adib et al., 2020;Ibarnia et al., 2020). However, it is essential that companies identify their stakeholders and their relevance (Mitchell et al., 1997) to meet their expectations. It is necessary to deepen, through qualitative research, the existence of stakeholder maps identified by companies.</p>
<p>It was possible to verify the recognition by scientists of the necessary organizational orientation towards the well-being of employees (Pérez et al., 2018). Being shown that CSR is significantly related to the psychological empowerment of the employee. (Gigol, 2020;Khusanova et al., 2019). Due to the positive effect between the trust generated by corporate CSR policies on the job satisfaction of workers (Clipa et al., 2019). Must promote sustainable labor relations in organizations (Jenny et al., 2020). Therefore, we confirm that CSR in companies is a potential health initiative, which can reduce stress in employees and achieve greater motivation and commitment. So we urge organizations to take the risk of offering more meaningful and less stressful work that would allow employees to perform their tasks without harm to their Being necessary to investigate the strategies of labor well-being of the organizations, focused on improving the health and quality of life of the employees.</p>
<p>The next step would be applying empirically this theoretical frame- is not corrected, the results can lead to misleading conclusions due to false correlations among key variables of interest (Ullah et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Panel data allows to introduce lagged values of the dependent variables in order to control dynamic endogeneity (Ullah et al., 2018). When conducting the co-occurrence analysis to identify the main research topics, it is observed that the investigations in both the <rs xml:id="12966499" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966500" type="software">Scopus</rs> cases are strongly interrelated, which answers the research questions of this manuscript.</p>
<p>In short, gaps have been found that indicate weaknesses in management, and limitations in integration from a stakeholder approach to CSR, since it has only just begun to develop CSR policies aimed at the social (Ibarnia et al., 2020). Therefore, the support of governments in terms of CSR principles and policies is essential to strengthen business management within the framework of compliance with the SDGs.</p>
<p>In this line of argument, the manuscript helps to elucidate the reason why CSR leads to positive results. We can affirm that the increase in talent retention and employee satisfaction is due to greater employee engagement. Engagement can be improved, among other channels, with the implementation of adequate CSR by company leaders. Consequently, the effectiveness and sustainability of companies revolve around CSR.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this work is related to the fact that, although two of the most important repositories of scientific publication have been used in the areas of sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities, <rs xml:id="12966501" type="software">Wos</rs> and <rs xml:id="12966502" type="software">Scopus</rs>, there are publications on the research topic, which are not found in them. In future works, the results could be taken into account by combining the data with those collected in other databases such as
