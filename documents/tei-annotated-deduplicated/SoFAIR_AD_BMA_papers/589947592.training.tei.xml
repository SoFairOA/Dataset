<p>Over the past 10 years, the concepts and objectives of circular economy have been increasingly detailed and become strategic issues of international, European, and national policies. However, the transition towards circular production models continues to be affected by several barriers and critical factors that make the transition difficult to achieve. The paper tries to design a relationship between sustainable production and lean production, highlighting the opportunity to invest in reverselogistics and how Industry 4.0 system represents a breeding ground for circular economy targets application. The aim of the current study is to examine the relationships among sustainable production, lean production, and Industry 4.0 in order to evidence the need to adopt a lean methodology and Industry 4.0 technologies in a sustainable development perspective for companies. Following a holistic vision, the authors summarize the production principles and formulas, which, although in parallel, lead to similar results and therefore represent the pillars of a competitive and sustainable business. In conclusion, exploring the circular economy principles and production chain model, challenges, opportunities, and future outlooks are formulated.</p>
<p>Pollution and the limited availability of natural resources to satisfy people's needs are causing increasingly alarming pressure upon the global ecosystem and, at the same time, dramatically determine different impacts on the costs of material and energy commodities and on the volatility of their market prices. Here emerges a critical condition to be managed by any companies involved in planning and programming of the materials, energies, and fuels flowing throughout its productive system. In this competitive business scenario, the question arises as to whether it is possible or even necessary to manage the adverse effects of consumption of unsustainable resources and production models?</p>
<p>The concept of sustainable production is not so new and dates back to quite some time by now. It was, indeed, Elkington (1994Elkington ( , 1998aElkington ( , 1998b)-one of the first scientists encouraging companies to reconsider their value creation activities in a multidimensional perspective, that integrates economic aspects, for example, profit, revenues, and economic returns on capital invested, that are a classic in the economic management of industries, with the environmental and social dimensions in an integrated framework called "triple bottom line" (TBL). Sustainability exists only when those three dimensions are holistically accomplished. In this sense, companies should carry out environmental life-cycle and socioeconomic assessments of their production systems, according to the TBL model. Doing so, this will allow them to improve the quality and sustainability of products they deliver and, in turn, of the downstream phases in which those products are utilized to produce more complex commodities, in an industrial symbiosis perspective. However, even today, companies have difficulty in having a clear and complete vision of the impact of their sustainable policies and strategies because there is no single and universal standard for calculating TBL performance (Helleno et al., 2017;Henao et al., 2019;Slaper &amp; Hall, 2011).</p>
<p>In the last decade, in March 2010, the European Commission presented its "Europe 2020" strategy, with the main aim of putting an end to the excessive exploitation of natural resources, and to the disparity in the availability of those resources in different geographical areas. "Europe 2020" was a 10-year strategic plan aimed at a structural transformation of the economic system and capable of facing the European economic crisis (European Commission, 2010).</p>
<p>Later, between September 25 and 27, 2015, the platform, "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development", was launched for the creation of a global action to favor sustainable development for people and the entire planet, while assuring the necessary prosperity conditions. This is also known as the "3P Agenda" and represents the document adopted by the Heads of State and Government, which establish the commitments for sustainable development to be achieved by 2030, identifying 17 goals (SDGs) and 169 related targets (United Nations, 2015).</p>
<p>In recent years, sustainable production has been strongly linked to circular economy (CE) principles that have taken a guiding role for the formulation of sustainable policies. According to Geng and Doberstein (2008), this concept brings together different strategies and approaches aimed at the following:</p>
<p>• increasing economic efficiency;</p>
<p>• adding value to businesses by maximizing energy, materials, and other resources;</p>
<p>• reducing the environmental impact of anthropic activities (in terms of exploitation of resources and emission of pollutants).</p>
<p>CE can be considered as an industrial economy that is oriented to sustainability (Ghisellini et al., 2016). Several key actions aimed at improving the economic and environmental performance of used resources are related to introducing CE on an industrial scale through adoption of closed loops for valorization of wastes and their recovery into material and energy commodities (Kalmykova et al., 2017).</p>
<p>In this sense, the research gives an attempt in expanding the lean production (LP) theory including environmental aspects and in contributing to highlighting the positive role of Industry 4.0 (I. 4.0) as an essential environment where redesign flows, processes, and targets.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of the present paper is to represent sustainable supply chain as a product of the simultaneous engagement of lean strategies and emerging technologies, using reverse logistics (RL) as a mean to achieve circularity and sustainability. Indeed, I. 4.0 represents the manufacturing scenario where various sustainable production strategies are being developed.</p>
<p>Hence, in this scenario, we introduce the research question Q1:</p>
<p>How to rethink the production model in a circular economy-oriented perspective at micro level, also compliant with the goals of the UN Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2015)?</p>
<p>This study was conducted to explore CE principles in a way to point out a practical business-oriented strategy that helps implement sustainable production paths.</p>
<p>The study reports upon findings from a theoretical work designed to attempt formulating key questions that need to be addressed to drive production competitiveness and sustainability in a way that they face the current challenges of satisfying the needs and the demands for food of an ever-growing population.</p>
<p>The article is divided into six sections. After Section 1, there is an overview of the strategies and tools to achieve satisfactory levels of application of CE models. In Section 2, CE principles and sustainable production policy are addressed. Moreover, the focus has been set upon the LP theory and tools, as one valid methodological support for a new strategy of competitive eco-business. Section 3 highlights ways for RL to answer the urgent need to translate the CE principles into actions. As for conclusions, Sections 4 and 5 carry out challenges, opportunities, and future outlooks within the emerging I. 4.0 environment.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector plays multiple key roles, from introducing innovation in production process and in terms of new or improved products, to the change in knowledge, job skills, market/consumer behaviors, as well as in worldwide adoption and promotion of sustainable production strategies and practices (Shankar et al., 2017;Tan et al., 2011). The concept of sustainability-expressed in the production model-incorporates objectives such as the reduction of consumption of resources and energy, selection of production processes with low environmental impact, and the development of eco-friendly products (Govindan et al., 2015;Schrader &amp; Thøgersen, 2011).</p>
<p>In order to summarize the definitions elaborated by the notable scholars, a table has been built, in which definitions of circular economy, lean production, Industry 4.0, Reverse Logistics, and Sustainable Lean Production are gathered Table 1.</p>
<p>It is crucial to highlight that sustainable production promotes sustainability throughout supply chain and, through the launch of sustainable products, the development of a community of sustainability-oriented end users (Gupta, 2016;Gupta et al., 2016;Smith &amp; Ball, 2012) that could be representatives of a new socio-technical system, becoming the leading infrastructure to support a green interaction between people and technology (Geels, 2011). Governments around the world promote financial and tax initiatives to accelerate the transition towards sustainable production practices and, subsequently, to favor increase of global growth and competitiveness (Moktadir et al., 2018;Sheldon, 2014).</p>
<p>The CE notion embraces optimization of natural resources, reusing and recycling them in production processes, eco-design of products, waste minimization, and the extension of their end of life. LP paradigm is a management approach that focuses on the elimination of wastes and the improvement of production and quality. Taddeo et al., 2019 Industry 4.0 entails digital transformation of companies and end user market.</p>
<p>Sustainable lean production "Green" or sustainable supply chain operates in sociotechnical systems. To evaluate their positive impacts and sustainability transition, they need to be empirically assessed.</p>
<p>The implementation of sustainability in supply chain management plays a key role in keeping up with corporate competitiveness. Furthermore, the integration of a lean approach could contribute to the competitive advantage of companies.</p>
<p>Brandenburg &amp; Rebs, 2015</p>
<p>The implementation of sustainability principles in LP leads to an environmental improvement in enterprises process flows. SLP is the result of interaction between lean principles and sustainability paradigm.</p>
<p>A SLP featured as lean-green manufacturing is a new practice that lack a clear research definition. Despite this, there is unanimous consensus on the fact that a lean-green approach improves performances in the triple bottom line perspective simultaneously.</p>
<p>Reverse logistics RL succeeds in achieving the minimization of waste through eco-effectiveness and "cradle to cradle" design of products.</p>
<p>In RL, waste is reintroduced into the same or another production cycle as a second raw material to create regenerative and circular systems. Indeed, promoting industrial-scale sustainability has become a central goal for national governments worldwide. In this regard, managers are facing the one big challenge to expand the concept of CE to productive company networks, so contributing to creating efficient interconnection models within a symbiotic industrial ecosystem and optimizing the market supply with a sustainable orientation of economies of scale (Simboli et al., 2015).</p>
<p>It is essential to consider that policies supporting the development of industrial sustainability must necessarily combine certain aspects of sustainable production that relate to different European Therefore, the implementation of adequate governmental policies plays a strategic role as a support to eco-innovation, promoting continuous pro-active collaborations between industrial companies (Aquilani et al., 2018).</p>
<p>In the last decade, the new vision of sustainability is represented and developed through the "CE" (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). Starting from the concept of closed loop, based upon the "cradle-to-cradle" approach, Andersen (2007) proposed the first scientific study to attempt defining the CE, through an analysis of the main principles and approaches that integrate environmental economics and sustainability. Specifically, from the policy maker's point of view, the first environmental policies that formally introduced the CE on a national scale were the Japanese and Chinese ones (Flynn et al., 2019). Then, it was the European Union's turn with countries like Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom setting relevant initiatives, policies, and guidelines to introduce the CE principles on the productive and societal system (McDowall et al., 2017;Reike et al., 2018).</p>
<p>In At the same time, I. 4.0 incorporates and enhances sustainability performance (Ghobakhloo, 2020).</p>
<p>The approaches adopted by I. 4.0 allow the linkage between sustainable production and CE, demonstrating a certain complementarity; indeed, I. 4.0 could be considered as a synergic environment essential F I G U R E 1 Matrix combining circular economy principles, taken from the "Circular Economy Action Plan", elaborated by European Commission, 2010, Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. and features of the environment I. 4.0, with features of the environment I. 4.0, gathered from the literature considered in the study. Source: authors' elaboration. The only strong negative correlation is placed between an increase of economic efficiency and the reduction of complexity in technological process flows because complexity is still viewed as a "measure of uncertainty" due to the fact that it has to manage a high number of data and variables in companies and its reduction represents a challenge for them (Mourtzis et al., 2019) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] to achieve holistic, integrated sustainability in production systems.</p>
<p>Many studies in literature have indicated CE and I. 4.0 as the future of the organization (Kristoffersen et al., 2020;Yadav et al., 2020;Zhong et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Furthermore, their interaction is catching the attention of different topics from strategic management to technological and operations management. The reason lays in the fact that companies need to redesign their business model focused on their sustainable development (Centobelli et al., 2020). In this regard, such a closed-loop production systems can be improved through the implementation of In this regard, some researchers have compared these loops with manufacturing metabolism (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c;McDonough &amp; Braungart, 2002). Moreover, thanks to Kirchherr et al. (2017), a clear definition of CE exists today and that is Hence, CE can be considered as generating economic, environmental, and societal benefits that results from adopting recovery, reuse, recycling, sharing, and collaboration practices that redefine the corporate business model (Moktadir et al., 2020). These results are In addition, CE model transition needs a legal framework support.</p>
<p>In this matter, the mandatory system plays a critical role in promoting circular bio-based models within a more sustainable business (Batista et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Finally, in CE assessment, there is still lack of standard methods (Kristensen &amp; Mosgaard, 2020;Sassanelli et al., 2019). Only few scholars have examined this topic, for example, Vinante et al. (2021), who has identified a large number of CE metrics at micro, meso, and macro level according to different sectors.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the transition from traditional, linear systems to CE-based sustainable production models (see Figure 2) is very difficult. If at the country level (macro) or in a general industrial system such as industrial parks (meso), it would be easier to find applications and relevant outcomes, but at the micro level, data lack, and a fragmented culture of sustainable production reduces the broad and general development that remains only as a best practice or a limited experience. According to Savaskan et al. (2004), the entire manufacturing sector should be reconfigured to focus, as much as possible, on reusing waste and process residues as a zero-burden resource for reprocessing to produce secondary raw materials, which then feed into the production of new goods (Angelis-Dimakis et al., 2016;Jia et al., 2020;Svensson, 2007). At the same time, it should have the ability to avoid rebound effects (see, e.g., Hertwich, 2008), which can have counterproductive effects for the whole process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as clarified by Geissdoerfer et al. (2017), the main beneficiaries of CE activities are the same economic actors who, as supply chain partners and system implementers, receive benefits and have returns from their investments.</p>
<p>The main contribution that CE can make to the strategic transition towards a sustainable production model covers the entire life cycle of products, which then become waste after use and are recycled to feed the same or different life cycles. The positive effect of this innovative approach is the increase in material circulation, that is, the relationship between secondary raw materials derived from waste and used materials. European countries that lead the ranking in terms of this indicator are as follows: the Netherlands (29.9%), France (18.6%), Belgium (17.8%), and United Kingdom (17.8%), followed by Italy (17.7%) (Circular Economy Network, ENEA, 2020). Despite the strategies implemented, the results obtained so far are still unsatisfactory and require significant efforts to improve performance both as single country and together as the whole European system.</p>
<p>A transition towards a CE model in the industrial sector would imply the application of appropriate sustainable production principles that focus on:</p>
<p>• increasing productivity through efficient usage of raw materials, by-products, waste, and energy;</p>
<p>• reducing emissions of pollutants from industrial processes.</p>
<p>Hence, it is understood that the holistic application of the environmental, economic, social, and technological principles of a CE model would represent the essential element to pursue sustainable development in the Industry. The selection of a management model, especially in the manufacturing sector, becomes a strategic factor in the transition towards a CEoriented business model. Indeed, the difficulty is due to the complexity of the manufacturing sector, which also needs to acquire the guidelines deriving from the sustainable development goals and consistently the CE principles.</p>
<p>Womack and Jones (1996) introduced a method-the LP, which proved to be particularly efficient and effective in the interpretation and management of processes and operations. LP contains, in short, five basic elements, namely, value, value flow, flow, pull, and perfection. In this sense, the authors also take into account the principles of production management, for example, elimination of waste, satisfying customer needs, focusing on activities that generate value and value flows, striving for perfection, guaranteeing reliability at all phases of production (Womack &amp; Jones, 1990), and guaranteeing continuous improvement (Kaizen) in all processes (Salem et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Recalling that CE aims at the following: (a) reducing waste, prices volatility, and the number of steps in the processes; (b) improving flow, transparency, flexibility, and control in processes; (c) satisfying customer needs through benchmarking and continuous improvement (Koskela, 1992), there is a clear awareness that LP principles have great potential to contribute to environmental well-being, and it is necessary to explore in detail the fundamental principle of lean management, which focuses on identifying and minimizing waste (Taddeo et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Lean management was introduced by Toyota's lean philosophy, which has evolved over time by adopting different application methods (Babalola et al., 2019;Koskela et al., 2002;Shingo, 1989).</p>
<p>On the other hand, lean supply chains have their origin in the just-in-time (JIT) philosophy that was first adopted by many American and European companies in the late 1980s and, then, performed at Toyota's Takaoka facility.</p>
<p>One of these approaches is an attempt to apply lean tools directly in the production environment (i.e., 5S, value stream mapping [VSM],</p>
<p>and just-in-time) (Tan et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Specifically, 5S, which stands for "order, straighten, standardize, polish, and sustain," is a lean tool that is usually adopted as a first step towards lean manufacturing by most companies (Chiarini, 2014;Salem et al., 2014). Furthermore, 5S focuses primarily on labeling and organizing material storage and inventory management; it is able to quickly identify spills, dangerous leaks and reduce air pollution (Bae &amp; Kim, 2008;Francis &amp; Thomas, 2020). VSM lean tool is used to understand waste and value in the production process. At the same time, it is possible to implement environmental assessment tools in order to understand the environmental impact.</p>
<p>In addition, the six-sigma approach has been adopted using cause and effect diagrams and Pareto diagrams, thus helping to take steps to mitigate and control costly activities in processes. Hence, it is assumed that it is necessary to incorporate lean, environmental tools, and six-sigma to evaluate and improve processes and to achieve better efficiency with less environmental impact. Traditionally, the lean approach does not directly identify opportunities for resources such as energy efficiency but is instead strategic for activities focused on eliminating waste and improving process flow time. This is the reason why a large number of SMEs are providing themselves with lean-digitized strategies (Ghobakhloo &amp; Fathi, 2019). Arroyo and Gonzalez (2016) suggest that the definition of waste within the lean boundary should be rethought to also incorporate social and environmental impacts. Therefore, it is worth exploring the potential of lean practices in the context of combating both resource and energy waste in all processes. A rethinking of the LP paradigm could be the start of a CE adoption strategy. In this sense, LP can therefore support a Sustainable Supply Chain in Muda (Defect)</p>
<p>Management, by being able to clearly and schematically represent bidirectional flows and highlight waste and wasteful activities.</p>
<p>Evidence from the production environment shows that resources and energy are considered to be a significant and expensive input for the flow of value and therefore unnecessary energy and material consumption must be considered as waste (Sciortino et al., 2009).</p>
<p>From this perspective, "energy waste" that incorporates underutilization, loss, dissipation as well as uneconomical energy use and transformation processes could be identified by the lean philosophy as the ninth waste, considering its potential for saving money and reducing polluting emissions (Baysan et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Therefore, the lean philosophy already allows to support ecodesign already at the design stage, thus promoting a circular production model that improves, through RL, the recyclability of a product that is increasingly sustainable, less energy-consuming, and based on secondary raw materials. Nonetheless, the lean-sustainable production concept is still a new business strategy, without tangible feedback on its practical implementation (Abualfaraa et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>In Figure 3, there is a built-up matrix in which LP strategies and I. 4.0 attributes are combined. Also here, it is shown a strong correlation between them. As a large number of authors argued (Rosin et al., 2019), I. 4.0 technologies are able to strengthen the efficiency of lean approaches, despite the lack of their empirical validation, for example, through real increase in profits for the organization.</p>
<p>This means that adopting lean strategy under the umbrella of CE principles, achieving the aims underlying new technologies, which can be summarized in improving efficiency, productivity, flexibility, transparency, and reducing complexity, is strongly enhanced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Figure 4, there is also a constructed matrix that summarizes the CE principles and LP strategies. This matrix emphasizes the existence of a strong, positive correlation between them. By interpreting these results, it can be said that both CE principles and LP strategies can be integrated into the same I. 4.0 environment to improve the competitiveness of organizations. In the figure, the only mild negative correlation concerns innovating and elimination of wastes. The reason lays in the fact that innovation should be considered not only sic et simpliciter as adopting emerging technologies and lean strategies but also as eco-innovation and eco-design of both technologies involved in the process flow, products, and packages (Sumrin et al., 2021). Innovation determines the elimination of wastes only if it is considered as eco-innovation and eco-design. Thus, this would imply recovering not only production wastes but also technological scraps. Therefore, achieving the elimination of wastes should involve the adoption of all forms of innovations (technologies, products, and services) that are able to reuse production waste as eco-designed smart new products (Gavrilescu et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The exploration of LP shows that it represents an advanced production strategy that guarantees improved productivity (Ohno, 1988;Resta et al., 2017). Recently, stakeholders involved in the value chain have been expecting greater integration of performance and competitiveness with environmental and social issues (Gupta, 2016;Martínez Le on &amp; Calvo-Amodio, 2017). LP in particular is increasingly used in F I G U R E 4 Matrix combining circular economy (CE) principles and lean production (LP) strategies. Source: authors' elaboration. In the Figure, the only mild negative correlation concerns innovating and elimination of wastes. The reason why the aforementioned correlation is mild negative is that innovation determines a complete elimination of wastes provided that it is considered not only sic et simpliciter as adopting emerging technologies and lean strategies but also as eco-innovation and eco-design of both technologies involved in the process flow, products, and packages [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] highly complex socio-technical systems characterized by high levels of uncertainty, diversity, and dynamic interactions, making them in fact already oriented towards the complexity of sustainability issues (Azadegan et al., 2013;Cilliers, 1999).</p>
<p>Internal effects are greater operational efficiency achieved through a reduction of costs and waste, whereas the external effects are related to brand and reputation enhancement that maintain loyalty to new market portions (Geldermann et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Sustainable production can be considered as a complex strategy that achieves the success only through the involvement of the entire supply chain. In this sense, in order to promote sustainability, there is a need for a strong ability to identify and pursue common and mutual benefits for producers, suppliers, and customers in an integrated and holistic perspective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is crucial the interaction between policymakers and companies. In fact, it can support or hinder transition towards the implementation of circular business models.</p>
<p>The activity of regulation of policymakers and international institutions can significantly influence and lead toward a CE transition.</p>
<p>In addition, they can have the power to get rid of the existing barriers to innovation and implementation of CE, through ad hoc actions for the market, society and for the adoption of the emerging technologies. Through this kind of collaboration, it could be feasible to reduction of waste, reuse of products, and the achievement of zero-waste goals.</p>
<p>Therefore, the role played by policymakers or international institutions has a high degree of importance. In fact, they can tip the balance leading the production model to a radical change. It would shift from a linear one, where natural resources are used for mass products to be disposed after use, to a "CE" model, where economic growth is boosted by RL.</p>
<p>Based on this statement, this is configured as a managerial problem. Adopting a lean approach as theoretical, methodological support can be useful for assessing the various contents and the areas covered by the supply chain management (SCM). Therefore, it would be noteworthy to highlight where principles of CE find a positive and pragmatic connection.</p>
<p>Indeed, thanks to SCM systems, which can be considered as the evolution of integrated company logistics, a strategic model based on the vertical integration of material management activities can be drawn as follows:</p>
<p>• the forecasting phase;</p>
<p>• the intermediate stages of the critical order process;</p>
<p>• the purchase activity;</p>
<p>• planning and programming;</p>
<p>• procurement and follow-up of production;</p>
<p>• storage of materials;</p>
<p>• the shipment, transport and delivery of the finished product to the market;</p>
<p>• the accounting of warehouse materials.</p>
<p>The SCM embeds eight business areas and relative processes:</p>
<p>1. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) including the identification of market objectives and targets and the development of engagement programs in collaboration with customers. The purpose of this process is to identify and acquire new customers in order to establish long-term loyalty relationships.</p>
<p>2. Customer Service Management including the exchange of information with customers about the product and the progress of orders.</p>
<p>To this end, many companies use information systems that, for example, allow the customer to modify their orders or check their status.</p>
<p>3. Demand Management providing reliable forecasts and reduces the variability of production installments, considering that the flow of materials and products is strongly correlated with the final demand.</p>
<p>4. Order fulfillment ensuring that deliveries to customers are accurate in terms of time, quality, and quantity.</p>
<p>5. Manufacturing Flow Management comprising the production of products requested by the customer. To this end, the company must be able to develop reliable predictions on the trend of market demand.</p>
<p>6. Procurement focusing on managing interactions with suppliers in order to create shared production process and new product development. Through RL, it is possible to recover important quantities of materials using circular flows. In the reverse cycle, in particular, the residue is reintroduced into the same or another production cycle as a second raw material (Howard et al., 2018).</p>
<p>According to Pushpamali et al. (2021), RL is perceived as an environmentally friendly practice in construction operations. In this study, in fact, it is highlighted that its implementation leads to a significant reduction of cost for materials in comparison with a purchase of new ones. The need for a quantitative analysis also addressed for future research. Therefore, it would be interesting carrying out empirical analysis based on case studies or statistical methods.</p>
<p>In order to access the opportunities deriving from the reverse cycles (closed circuits), it is necessary to strengthen the legislation, also through intersectoral agreements, promoting the key role of logistics also through symbiotic and inclusive production systems (Farooque et al., 2019). Comprehensively, the Council of Logistics Management (CLM)</p>
<p>defines RL as "a term often used to refer to the role of logistics in recycling, waste disposal and management of hazardous materials; a broader perspective includes a report on logistical activities carried out in the reduction of sources, recycling, replacement, reuse of materials and disposal". In summary, RL is considered more than a configuration of the logistics system to collect products from end users for recycling or renewal at recycling plants (Braungart et al., 2007).</p>
<p>According to Brandenburg and Rebs (2015), sustainable production encompasses the concepts of CE, RL, and sustainable supply chain in an integrated manner (see Figure 5) (Papachristos, 2014). As main result, the key success factor is the interdependence between technical and economic aspects and environmental responsibility (S aez-Martínez et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Based upon the previous paragraphs, sustainable production requires a throughout environmental assessment, applied to whole supply chain. In this sense, sustainable production can maximize resource efficiency in the entire industrial production system by minimizing negative environmental impact in each process (Macchi et al., 2020).</p>
<p>According to Ioppolo et al. (2014), LM contributes to the qualita- In detail, it is feasible through the following activities:</p>
<p>• dematerializing and de-energizing both production and finished products, enhancing services throughout its life;</p>
<p>• promoting the use of low environmental impact materials by reducing emissions and dispersion of toxic substances during and, especially, at the end of life;</p>
<p>• introducing the qualitative and quantitative measurement and analysis of consumption and associated environmental loads of resources and energy, with particular attention to the part coming from recovery as secondary raw materials derived from RL processes;</p>
<p>• investing in eco-design by promoting the use of recyclable materials and enhancing both "RL" actions and the use of renewable energy and resources, capable of extending the useful life of a product;</p>
<p>• strengthening a model of "functional economy" aimed at replacing products with services, increasing the efficiency of production and finished products. This is highlighted in Figure 6. By integrating the three pillars, LP strategy, CE principles, and I. 4.0 environment, through RL, it is possible to improve process flows in supply chains and give rise to "digital, sustainable products, and processes".</p>
<p>Such "digital sustainable products and processes" could meet the essential human needs by satisfying their requests. In fact, digital process flows would be more simplified and smarter. This would lead to a reduction of lead times and a delivery of products customized on consumer needs. Furthermore, this would imply more sustainable supply chains aiming at minimizing wastes and depletion of natural resources. In this sense, they would meet the goals of "functional economy" based on the optimization of the use (or function) of goods and services and thus the management of existing resources and energy (Stahel, 1997). Furthermore, the role of CE in these process flows would be that of a functional economy, where end-users pay for the use of products and not for their ownership (Urbinati et al., 2017). In this sense, products with extensive lifecycles, which can be easily dismantled and recovered at the end of their life as well as technology, become the vehicles to provide a function and optimize their use.</p>
<p>In addition, the integration of CE principles within the lean philosophy improves its overall environmental contribution. Following Lewandowski's (2016) Nevertheless, this paradigm shift in manufacturing companies is still far from being implemented, as most of the processes and products are not designed to integrate the principle of "flexibility and speed at customer request" into the CE.</p>
<p>Beside this, other weaknesses of the current analysis concern the fact that it is only a theoretical study that aims at integrating I.4.0, LP, and CE. Thus, it would need further empirical investigations. Furthermore, a strong weakness of the topic tackled in the present study could regard the difficulty in engaging all the stakeholders such as Governments, international institutions, and companies to advance the transition toward sustainable and digitalized process flows.</p>
<p>The innovative approach of I. 4.0 can face the challenge precisely in terms of RL. In fact, through the intelligent sharing of spaces tures throughout the organization (Sanders et al., 2016). In this advanced technological environment, through the extensive and pervasive use of AI, it is possible to accurately forecast customer requests and manage the entire supply chain from incoming logistics to production, outgoing logistics, marketing, sales, and assistance (Flint et al., 2005;Kagermann et al., 2013;Klumpp, 2017). In this sense, both scientific and industrial sectors must focus on finding optimal strategies that will adopt new digital technologies enabling the promotion of sustainable development principles as a competitive business strategy. This productive environment finds application in I. 4.0 and digital environment, where the supply chain can be flexible, smart, integrative, and responsive thanks to technology. Consequently, despite difficulties in collecting data, a quantitative analysis of the beneficial effects in terms of both environmental and social benefits from the integration of the three main pillars, I. 4.0, LP, and CE, would be desirable.</p>
<p>Smart technologies and the digital environment improve the potential of the entire manufacturing supply chain but require greater awareness of the enhanced paradigms of human-machine interaction.</p>
<p>In this regard, international and national programs are investing in long-term policies that support a transition towards sustainable production. Future research must better promote cooperation between all stakeholders involved in the production chain, giving strategic importance to those involved in recycling and recovery activities. In conclusion, the paper proposes an original point of view with a preliminary "fil rouge" drawing and integrating the possible relationship between lean manufacturing, CE, and I. 4.0 in order to stimulate productive discussion.</p>
