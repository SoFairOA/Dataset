<p>Meng et al. report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike DH69/V70 has arisen multiple times. The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity. The B.1.1.7 spike requires DH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.</p>
<p>Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7</p>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensinconverting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection (Zhou et al., 2020), and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Sungnak et al., 2020). Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations (Starr et al., 2020b;Thomson et al., 2020), raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vac-cine-induced immunity (Cele et al., 2021;Collier et al., 2021;Gupta, 2021;Madhi et al., 2021) and monoclonal antibody treatments (Starr et al., 2021). Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens (Greaney et al., 2021a(Greaney et al., , 2021b;;Starr et al., 2020a), and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates (Choi et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate. This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre-or asymptomatic phases Article prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response (He et al., 2020;Mlcochova et al., 2020). We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP) (Kemp et al., 2021). In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with DH69/ V70 (Bazykin et al., 2021). Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection (Choi et al., 2020) and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies (McCallum et al., 2021;McCarthy et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that DH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports (Motozono et al., 2021;Thomson et al., 2021). Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the DH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Functionally, we find that DH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F. The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions. We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein. We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells. Repair of the two amino acids not only leads to reduced B.1.1.7 spike incorporation into virions and impaired infectivity but also reduces cell-cell fusion kinetics back to WT levels.</p>
<p>The deletion H69/V70 is present in over 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences worldwide and has seen global expansion, particularly across much of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 1). DH69/V70 is observed in multiple global lineages (Figure 1A). Although variants with deletions in this region of spike are observed in GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017), the earliest unambiguous sequences that included the DH69/V70 were detected on a D614 background in January 2020 (United States and Thailand). The earliest DH69/V70 detected on a D614G background occurred in Sweden in April 2020. Prevalence of DH69/V70 has increased since August 2020 (Figure 1B). Further analysis of sequences revealed, first, that single deletion of H69 or V70 was uncommon and, second, that some lineages of DH69/V70 alone were present as well as DH69/V70 in the context of other mutations in spike, specifically those in the receptor binding motif (RBM; Figure 1). DH69/V70 is not a neutralizing antibody escape mechanism We hypothesized that DH69/V70 might confer reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. We first examined the protein structural context of DH69/V70 for clues regarding alterations in epitopes (Figures 2A and2B). In the absence of experimentally derived structural data for DH69/V70, the protein structure of the NTD possessing the double deletion was modeled in silico. The DH69/V70 was predicted to alter the conformation of a protruding loop comprising residues 69-76, pulling it in toward the NTD (Figure 2B). In the post-deletion structural model, the positions of the alpha carbons of residues on either side of the deleted residues, Ile68 and Ser71, were each predicted to occupy positions 2.9 A ˚from the positions of His69 and Val70 in the pre-deletion structure. Concurrently, the positions of Ser71, Gly72, Thr73, Asn74, and Gly75 are predicted to have changed by 6.5 A ˚, 6.7 A ˚, 6.0 A ˚, 6.2 A ˚, and 8 A ˚, respectively, with the overall effect of these residues moving inward, resulting in a less dramatically protruding loop. This predicted change in the surface of spike could be consistent with antibody evasion. To test this, we explored whether DH69/V70 conferred reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in sera from 15 recovered individuals (Figures 2C and2D). We performed serial dilutions of sera before mixing with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with spike proteins with and without DH69/V70 (with virus input normalized for infectivity). We plotted infection of target cells as a function of serum dilution (Figure 2D). All but two sera demonstrated clear titratable neutralization of WT and DH69/V70 virus. There was no overall change in susceptibility to serum neutralization for DH69/V70 relative to the WT (Figure 2C), but there was a proportion of individuals with slightly increased neutralization sensitivity of DH69/V70 (Figures 2C and2D). To further explore the role of DH69/V70 in inducing immune escape, we tested the binding of 12 NTD mAbs to the WT and DH69/V70 NTD by biolayer interferometry (Figures 2E-2G). All NTD mAbs showed less than a 2-fold decrease in binding to DH69/V70 compared with the WT. These data suggest that DH69/V70 does not represent an important antibody escape mechanism.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the deletion might, alternatively, enhance virus infectivity. In the absence of virus isolates, we used a lentiviral PV approach to test the effect of DH69/V70 on virus spike protein-mediated entry. D614G bearing Wuhan-1 spike-expressing DNA plasmid (WT) was co-transfected in HEK293T producer cells along with plasmids encoding a lentiviral capsid and genome for luciferase. Infectivity was adjusted for input reversetranscriptase activity; we observed a 2-fold increase in PV infectivity of DH69/V70 compared with the WT in HeLa cervical epithelial cells stably expressing human ACE2 (Figures 3A and 3B). We observed similar fold increases with DH69/V70 in a range of other target cells in the context of overexpression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 (HEK293T cells transiently transfected with ACE2, or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and A549 lung cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2; Rihn et al., 2021) or endogenous levels of receptors in Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells (Figure 3A).</p>
<p>Western blotting for S2 spike indicated a higher amount of cleaved spike in DH69/V70 bearing virions and in the HEK293T producer cell lysates. We also noted a corresponding reduction in uncleaved full-length (FL) spike (Figure 3C). Densitometric analysis of spike and p24 from western blots in multiple experiments showed almost a 2-fold increase in the spike:p24 ratio as well as an increased ratio in S2:FL cleavage for DH69/V70, indicating that increased spike incorporation into virions might explain the increase in infectivity (Figures 3D and3E). To verify that this increase in S from producer cells was not specific to HEK293T cells, we also transfected the human lung epithelial cell line H1299 (Zhang et al., 2020) with spike and lentiviral packaging plasmids. We again observed that viruses from these cells had 2-fold increased infectivity in target cells (Figure 3F). In addition, the increased total and cleaved S levels were recapitulated in the cell lysates and purified virions from these lung cells (Figures 3G and 3H). Therefore, we conclude that the increased S cleavage and its incorporation observed in producer cells and pseudotyped virions is a generalized phenomenon for DH69/ V70 S. To explore whether D614G was required for this enhanced spike cleavage and infectivity, we generated PVs bearing D614 spike with and without DH69/V70, followed by infection of HEK293T cells. We observed a similar 2-fold enhancement of infection and a proportional increase in spike incorporation as we did for D614G spike PVs (Figures S1A and S1B). Finally, to exclude the possibility that increased incorporation of S was specific for pseudotyped lentiviral particles, we generated coronavirus-like particles by co-transfection of WT or DH69/V70 S with SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as described previously (Swann et al., 2020;Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). Compared with levels of N, levels of cleaved S in coronavirus-like particles were again enhanced in the presence of the DH69/V70 (Figures S1C andS1D).</p>
<p>Enhanced infectivity of DH69/V70 spike is not correlated with cleavage or entry route SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells is thought to take place by two distinct routes following binding to ACE2 (Figure 4A). The first is an endosomal route where cathepsin is able to cleave spike with pH-dependent fusion in the endosome. The second route involves fusion at the plasma membrane with cleavage via the plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2. To determine the mechanism by which increased spike cleavage in the context of DH69/V70 might affect entry, we used an inhibitor of furin cleavage (CMK) and protease inhibitors specific to the endosomal (ED64D) and plasma membrane fusion (camostat) entry routes (Figure 4A). We first treated producer cells with CMK and found that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S DH69/V70 plasmid and that the spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions (Figure 4B). We found that CMK treatment, although reducing S1/S2 cleavage, did not decrease PV infection in a variety of target cells (Figure 4C), suggesting that the increased infectivity in DH69/V70 is not due to more efficient cleavage of spike. To confirm our findings, we generated a spike lacking the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) with or without DH69/ V70 and tested PV infectivity on HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We found that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site led to increased infectivity of the PV, as observed previously for mutated PBCS (Papa et al., 2021). As expected, deletion of the PBCS did not alter the enhancing effect of DH69/V70 on PV infectivity (Figure 4D).</p>
<p>The altered level of S1/S2 cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to its dependence on viral entry through membrane fusion or endocytosis in HEK293T and A549 cells (Peacock et al., 2020;Winstone et al., 2021). We therefore hypothesized that the increased spike cleavage of DH69/V70 S could influence the route of entry. To probe this, spike pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT spike, DH69/V70 spike, or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used to transduce HEK293T-ACE2 or HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations (Figure 4E). As expected, the VSV-G pseudotyped particles were not affected by addition of E64D or camostat. Consistent with previous observations, the WT PV utilized endocytosis in the absence of TMPRSS2 (Peacock et al., 2020), but where TMPRSS2 was expressed, plasma membrane fusion became the dominant route (Papa et al., 2021;Winstone et al., 2021). However, there were no differences between WT and DH69/V70 in relative utilization of the endosomal versus plasma membrane entry routes. We conclude that the enhanced spike cleavage, although notable in DH69/V70, does not appear to be responsible for the increased infectivity of DH69/V70 spike observed in these cell line-based experiments.</p>
<p>We next examined in greater detail the SARS-CoV-2 lineages where S mutations in the RBD were identified at high frequency and where DH69/V70 co-occurs. For example, N439K, an amino acid replacement reported to define variants increasing in numbers in Europe and other regions (Thomson et al., 2020; (E-G) Kinetics of binding to WT and DH69/V70 NTD of 12 NTD-specific mAbs. (legend continued on next page)</p>
<p>Figures 1 and 5A) now mostly co-occurs with DH69/V70. N439K appears to have reduced susceptibility to some convalescent sera as well as mAbs targeting the RBD while increasing affinity for ACE2 in vitro (Thomson et al., 2021). The first lineage possessing N439K (and not DH69/V70), B.1.141, is now extinct (Thomson et al., 2020). A second lineage with N439K, B.1.258, emerged later and subsequently acquired DH69/V70, leading to the initial rapid increase in the frequency of viruses possessing this deletion, spreading into Europe (Figure 1A; Brejova ´et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The second significant cluster with DH69/V70 and RBD mutants involves Y453F, another spike RBD mutation that increases binding affinity to ACE2 (Starr et al., 2020b), and has been found to be associated with mink-human infection (Munnink et al., 2021). Y453F has also been described as an escape mutation for mAb REGN10933, shows reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera (Baum et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2021), and is possibly a T cell escape mutation (Motozono et al., 2021). DH69/V70 was first detected in the Y453F background on August 24, 2020 and so far appears to be limited to Danish sequences (Figures 1 and5B), although an independent acquisition was recently reported along with DH69/V70 in an immunecompromised Russian individual with chronic infection (Bazykin et al., 2021).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that DH69/V70 might have arisen after Y453F and N439K to compensate for potential loss of infectivity, which has been reported previously for these RBD mutants (Motozono et al., 2021;Thomson et al., 2021). We therefore generated mutant spike plasmids bearing RBD mutations Y453F and N439K (Figure 5C) with and without DH69/V70 and performed infectivity assays in the lentiviral pseudotyping system. RBD mutations reduced infectivity of spike relative to the WT by around 2-fold (Figure 5D) and was partially rescued by DH69/V70. Based on observations of the effect of DH69/V70 on spike incorporation in the WT (Figure 3D), we predicted that the mechanism of increased infectivity for DH69/V70 in the context of RBD mutations might be similar. Analysis of virions from cell supernatants and cell lysates indeed showed an increased ratio of spike:p24 (Figures 5E and5F). As observed for the WT, we also observed increased cleaved S2:FL when DH69/V70 was present along with the RBD mutants in PVs (Figures 5E and5G). DH69/V70 is required for optimal B.1.1.7 Alpha variant spike S2 incorporation and infectivity A lineage containing DH69/V70 was first detected in the United Kingdom with the RBD mutation N501Y along with multiple other spike and other mutations (Figure 1; Figure S2). Sequences belonging to this lineage were subsequently called B.1.1.7 and classified as a variant of concern (VOC) due to a higher rate of transmission (Volz et al., 2021b). It was more recently named the Alpha variant by WHO. Subsequently B.1.1.7 has spread rapidly to over 100 countries, exemplifying a new chapter in the pandemic, with additional VOCs detected in other geographical locations. In addition to RBD N501Y and NTD DH69/V70, B.1.1.7 is defined by further S mutations across S2 (T716I, S982A, and D1118H) and S1 (DY144, A570D, and P681H) (Figure 6A; Rambaut et al., 2020). The available sequence data did not enable determination of whether the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 mutations N501Y and DH69/V70 arose as a result of an N501Y virus acquiring DH69/V70 or vice versa, although a United Kingdom Alpha variant B.1.1.7 sequence was identified with N501Y, A570D, DH69/V70, and D1118H (Figure S2).</p>
<p>To ascertain whether H69V70 is a target for neutralizing antibodies in the context of the Alpha variant B.1.1.7, we first tested 12 NTD-specific mAbs isolated from 4 individuals who recovered from WT SARS-CoV-2 infection with an in-vitro PV neutralization assay using WT SARS-CoV-2 S and the B.1.1.7 S or B.1.1.7 S with reversion of the H69/V70 deletions (B.1.1.7 H69/V70) PVs in VeroE6 target cells expressing TMPRSS2. We found that 7 of 12 NTD-specific mAbs (58%) showed a marked decrease or complete loss of neutralizing activity to B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7 H69/V70 (&gt;30-fold-change reduction), suggesting that, in a sizeable fraction of NTD antibodies, the H69/V70 deletion is not responsible for their loss of neutralizing activity (Figure S3). The remaining 5 mAbs showed a partial reduction (2-to 10-fold) in Alpha variant B.1.1.7 neutralization that was not rescued by reversion of the H69/V70 deletions.</p>
<p>Given our data on introduction of DH69/V70 into the WT (Figure 3), we hypothesized that DH69/V70 was selected in the evolution of Alpha variant B.1.1.7 to increase viral entry. We predicted that replacement of H69 and V70 would impair the infectivity of the B.1.1.7 PV and reduce total spike levels. To examine this, we compared the infectivity of the B.1.1.7 spike PV versus the B.1.1.7 PV with restored H69 and V70. We observed that B.1.1.7 infectivity was slightly lower than that of the WT (Figure 6B). As expected, we observed a significant reduction in infectivity for viruses where H69 and V70 had been re-inserted across a number of cell types, including H1299 expressing endogenous levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors (Figures 6B and6C). When we measured spike incorporation into virions, we found that the reduced infectivity of B.1.1.7 with replaced H69 V70 was associated with reduced spike:p24 and S2:FL ratios, as expected (Figures 6D-6G). pathology (Braga et al., 2021). We expressed B.1.1.7 spike or a B.1.1.7 with restored H69 and V70 together with the mCherry fluorescent protein in HEK293T cells and labeled Vero cells with a green fluorescent dye (Figure 7A). All spike constructs showed similar protein expression and achieved similar cell-cell fusion by 16 h. B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2-3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing. Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B-7D). We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on DH69/V70. S4C). We observed substantial variability in the region, resulting in frequent insertions or deletions (indels), with some viruses including SARS-CoV having 6-to 7-amino-acid deletions (Figure S4B). This is indicative of high structural plasticity in this protein region that could allow sarbecoviruses to alter their spike conformation. RaTG13 is the evolutionarily closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 for this region and, after RaTG13, is the cluster of 5 CoVs sampled in trafficked pangolins in the Guangxi province (Lam et al., 2020). Inspection of the 69/70 region in these virus sequences raises the interesting observation that one of the five viruses in the cluster, P2V, has amino acids 69H and 70L present, whereas the other four have a double amino acid deletion (Figures S4A-S4C). Given that SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the homologous HV insertion at these positions, one explanation is that the proximal common ancestor between SARS-CoV-2 and the Guangxi pangolin cluster had the insertion, which was then lost while circulating in the pangolin population, similar to observations with SARS-CoV-2 in humans. However, the fact that P2V was cultured in Vero E6 cells prior to sequencing (contrary to the other 4, sequenced directly from the pangolin sample) raises the possibility of this being an independent insertion, favored as a monkey cell line-specific adaptation. Interestingly, the double amino acid indel in the pangolin viruses is in frame, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the two almost identical bat viruses sequenced recently from Cambodian samples, RShSTT182 and RShSTT200 (Hul et al., 2021), possess an H69V70 insertion despite being more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 for this region of spike (Figures S4A-S4C). This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses. To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of DH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S DH69/V70 counterpart. We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the DH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D andS4E). This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of DH69/ V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.</p>
<p>We have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike DH69/V70. This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5). Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase (Harrison et al., 1998). Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures (Delarue et al., 1990;Ollis et al., 1985;Sousa et al., 1993), it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination (Reeder and Lang, 1994). A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops (Huston et al., 2021). These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of DH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion DY144 (Chi et al., 2020;McCarthy et al., 2020McCarthy et al., , 2021) (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs. DH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility (Volz et al., 2021a) and, possibly, pathogenicity (Davies et al., 2021).</p>
<p>We find that DH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD. In addition, we have shown that repair of DH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike. Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism. Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that DH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost (Motozono et al., 2021;Thomson et al., 2021). We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where DH69/V70 is present. The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used. Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the DH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters (Liu et al., 2021). Indeed, DH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage (Szemiel et al., 2021).</p>
<p>We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing DH69/ V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G). This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles. Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by DH69/V70. Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment. These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike DH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage. Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK (Papa et al., 2021). In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT (Lubinski et al., 2021). There may, however, be differences in vivo.</p>
<p>We explored the entry route of DH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion. DH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike. Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models (Peacock et al., 2020), cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances. In addition, Peacock et al. ( 2020) showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.</p>
<p>The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic (Davies et al., 2021) and more transmissible (Volz et al., 2021a). Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection (Kemp et al., 2021).</p>
<p>We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells (Brown et al., 2021) but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations (Liu et al., 2021). Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/ V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions. These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.</p>
<p>Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on DH69/V70. Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 (Bussani et al., 2020) and implicated in elevated viral replication (Braga et al., 2021). We speculate that the increased fusogenicity of B.1.1.7 spike may contribute to the higher mortality (Davies et al., 2021) and transmissibility of B.1.1.7 (Volz et al., 2021a).</p>
<p>Although we combined epidemiological, evolutionary, protein and RNA structure, and experimental data in our study, a limitation is that the experiments were conducted with PVs and coronavirus-like particles rather than replication-competent viruses. We also carried out experiments in cells overexpressing receptors, although the results were recapitulated in lung cell lines expressing endogenous levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.</p>
<p>Detection and surveillance of B.1.1.7 has been facilitated in the United Kingdom by the phenomenon of SGTF (S[pike] gene target failure) because of primers in the Thermo Fisher Scientific SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic qPCR assay used by a significant number of testing facilities. The S gene target (binding in the region of H69/V70) is one of three; therefore, a marker for the spread of B.1.1.7 has been tracked by loss of signal in the S gene target (Volz et al., 2021b). However, recent reports from the United States and central Europe caution against use of SGTF as a sole marker for B.1.1.7 detection because a significant DH69/ V70 lineage without other mutations in spike is circulating in the United States, and a B.1.258 lineage with N439K with DH69/V70 is circulating in Slovakia/Czech Republic (Brejova ét al., 2021;Larsen and Worobey, 2020). Such examples highlight the need for genome sequencing to accompany novel approaches to diagnostics for variants.</p>
<p>Given the emergence of multiple clusters of variants carrying RBD mutations and DH69/V70 , limitation of transmission takes on renewed urgency. As another example, a new VOC bearing DH69/V70 with E484K was recently identified (B.1.525). Comprehensive vaccination efforts should be accelerated to limit transmission and acquisition of further mutations, and future vaccines could include DH69/V70 to close this route for virus evolution, assuming that effective neutralizing antibodies to this region are generated. Fortunately, our experiments with RaTG13 demonstrate that DH69/V70 may not enhance the infectivity of other bat sarbecoviruses with zoonotic potential.</p>
<p>We found that a two-amino-acid deletion, DH69/V70, promotes SARS-CoV-2 spike incorporation into viral particles and increases infectivity by a mechanism that remains to be fully explained. This deletion has arisen multiple times and often after spike antibody escape mutations that reduce spike-mediated entry efficiency. Critically, B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncitium formation, and this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on DH69/V70. In addition, B.1.1.7 spike requires DH69/V70 for optimal infectivity, and we conclude that DH69/ V70 enables SARS-CoV-2 to tolerate multiple immune escape mutations while maintaining infectivity and fusogenicity.</p>

<p>HEK293T CRL-3216, Vero CCL-81 were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100mg/ml streptomycin. All cells are regularly tested and are mycoplasma free. H1299 cells were a kind gift from Simon Cook. Calu-3 cells were a kind gift from Paul Lehner, A549 A2T2 (Rihn et al., 2021) cells were a kind gift from Massimo Palmerini.</p>
<p>Plasmids encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 D614 with a C-terminal 19 amino acid deletion with D614G, were used as a template to produce variants lacking amino acids at position H69 and V70, as well as mutations N439K and Y453F. Mutations were introduced using Quickchange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) following the manufacturer's instructions. B.1.1.7 S expressing plasmid preparation was described previously by step wise mutagenesis (Collier et al., 2021). Viral vectors were prepared by transfection of 293T cells by using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega). 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of 11ul of Fugene HD, 1mg of pCDNAD19 spike-HA, 1ug of p8.91 HIV-1 gag-pol expression vector and 1.5mg of pCSFLW (expressing the firefly luciferase reporter gene with the HIV-1 packaging signal). Viral supernatant was collected at 48 and 72h after transfection, filtered through 0.45um filter and stored at À80 C as previously described. Infectivity was measured by luciferase detection in target 293T cells transfected with TMPRSS2 and ACE2.</p>
<p>Plasmids encoding the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 D614 (Wuhan) and RaTG13, in frame with a C -terminal Flag tag (Conceicao et al., 2020), were used as a template to produce variants lacking amino acids at position H69 and V70. The deletion was introduced using Quickchange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) following the manufacturer's instructions. Viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation; 25mL of crude preparation being purified on a 20% sucrose cushion at 2300rpm for 2 hr at 4 C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the viral pellet resuspended in 600 mL DMEM (10% FBS) and stored at À80 C. Infectivity was examined in HEK293 cells transfected with human ACE2, with RLUs normalized to RT activity present in the pseudotyped virus preparation by PERT assay. Western blots were performed on purified virus with anti-HIV1 p24, 1:1,000 (Abcam) or anti-FLAG, 1:2,000 (Sigma) antibodies used following SDS-PAGE and transfer.</p>
<p>The reverse transcriptase activity of virus preparations was determined by qPCR using a SYBR Green-based product-enhanced PCR assay (SG-PERT) as previously described (Vermeire et al., 2012). Briefly, 10-fold dilutions of virus supernatant were lysed in a 1:1 ratio in a 2x lysis solution (made up of 40% glycerol v/v 0.25% Trition X-100 v/v 100mM KCl, RNase inhibitor 0.8 U/ml, TrisHCL 100mM, buffered to pH7.4) for 10 minutes at room temperature.</p>
<p>12ml of each sample lysate was added to 13ml of a SYBR Green master mix (containing 0.5mM of MS2-RNA Fwd and Rev primers, 3.5pmol/ml of MS2-RNA, and 0.125U/ml of Ribolock RNase inhibitor and cycled in a QuantStudio. Relative amounts of reverse transcriptase activity were determined as the rate of transcription of bacteriophage MS2 RNA, with absolute RT activity calculated by comparing the relative amounts of RT to an RT standard of known activity.</p>
<p>Plasmids encoding codon-optimized (M)embrane, (E)nvelope and (N)ucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were a kind gift from Nevan Krogan (M, pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-M-2xStrep-IRES-Puro, Addgene #141386; E, pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-E-2xStrep-IRES-Puro, Addgene #141385; N, pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-N-2xStrep-IRES-Puro, Addgene #141391) (Gordon et al., 2020). For expression in 293T cells, M, E and N were each subcloned into a modified pmaxGFP (Lonza) vector as M/E/N-IRES-GFP. Plasmids encoding the (S)pike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with a C-terminal 19 amino acid deletion plus/minus the DH69/ V70 deletion are described above (pseudotype virus preparation).</p>
<p>Coronavirus-like particles were prepared essentially as previously described (Swann et al., 2020;Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). In brief, 4 310 6 293T cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) with a total of 4 mg DNA comprising 1 mg each of plasmids encoding S (WT or DH69/V70), M, E and N. Media was replaced after 16 h.</p>
<p>Supernatants containing coronavirus-like particles were harvested after 2 d, spun for 10 min at 2,000 g, then passed through a 0.45 mm filter. For each condition, 9 mL supernatant was layered on a 2 mL cushion of 20% sucrose in PBS and spun for 2 h at 100,000 g in a Type 70 Ti Beckman Coulter Ultracentrifuge Rotor. The pellet was washed once with PBS, then resuspended in 100 ml 2% SDS in PBS. After aspiration of supernatant, cells were washed twice in PBS, then lysed in 800 ml of 2% SDS in TBS with 500 units of Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated for 30 m at room temperature, then spun for 10 min at 13,000 g.</p>
<p>Resuspended pellets containing concentrated coronavirus-like particles were heated in Laemmli buffer with DTT at 95 C for 5 min. For each condition, 30 mL was loaded on a 4%-20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gel (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific), then heated in Laemmli buffer with DTT at 95 C for 5 min. For each condition, 20 mg protein was loaded on an identical gel. Proteins were transferred to 45 nm PDVF membranes and blocked with 5% milk in PBS-Tween 0.2%. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-S (Invitrogen, PA1-41165); anti-N (Novus Biologicals, NB100-56683) and anti-b-actin (Sigma, A5316).</p>
<p>CMK furin inhibitor experiments: 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Gag/pol, luciferase, and spike. Furin inhibitor CMK (Calbiochem) was added at either 5 M or 25 mM concentration three hours post transfection. The supernatants and cell lysates were collected after 48 hours for infectivity on target cells or for western blotting.</p>
<p>E64D and camostat experiments: ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transfected 293T cells were either E64D (Tocris) or camostat (Sigma-Aldrich) treated for 3 hours at each drug concentration before the addition of a comparable amount of input viruses pseudotyped with WT, H69/V70 deletion or VSV-G (approx. 1 million RLU). The cells were then left for 48 hours before addition of substrate for luciferase (Promega) and read on a Glomax plate reader (Promega). The RLU was normalized against the no-drug control which was set as 100%.</p>
<p>Cell fusion assay was carried out as previously described (Papa et al., 2021). Briefly, Vero cells and 293T cells were seeded at 80% confluency in a 24 multiwell plate. 293T cells were co-transfected with 1.5 mg of spike expression plasmids in pCDNA3 and 0.5 mg mCherry-N1 using Fugene 6 and following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Vero cells were treated with CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) (Thermo Scientific) for 20 minutes. 293T cells were then detached 5 hours post transfection, mixed together with the green-labeled Vero cells, and plated in a 12 multiwell plate. Cell-cell fusion was measured using an Incucyte and determined as the proportion of merged area to green area over time. Data were then analyzed using
<rs xml:id="12891364" type="software">Incucyte</rs> software analysis. Data were normalized to cells transfected only with mCherry protein and mixed with green labeled Vero cells. Graphs were generated using
<rs xml:id="12891365" type="software">Prism</rs>
<rs xml:id="12891366" type="version" corresp="12891365">8</rs> software.
</p>
<p>Cells were lysed and supernatants collected 18 hours post transfection. Purified virions were prepared by harvesting supernatants and passing through a 0.45 mm filter. Clarified supernatants were then loaded onto a thin layer of 8.4% optiprep density gradient medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for ultracentrifugation for 2 hours at 20,000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended for western blotting. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (Cell signaling) or were treated with Benzonase Nuclease (Millipore) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then run on 4%-12% Bis Tris gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes using an iBlot or semidry (Thermofisher and Biorad, respectively).</p>
<p>Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature with agitation, incubated in primary antibody (anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Thermofisher, PA1-41165), anti-GAPDH (proteintech) or anti-p24 (NIBSC)) diluted in 5% non-fat milk in PBST for 2 hours at 4 C with agitation, washed four times in PBST for 5 minutes at room temperature with agitation and incubated in secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP conjugate), anti-bactin HRP (Santa Cruz) diluted in 5% non-fat milk in PBST for 1 hour with agitation at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times in PBST for 5 minutes at room temperature and imaged directly using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).</p>

<p>This study did not generate new unique reagents.</p>
<p>Raw anonymized data are available from the lead contact without restriction.</p>
<p>The study was primarily a laboratory based study using pseudotyped virus (PV) with mutations generates by site directed mutagenesis. We tested infectivity in cell lines with a range of drug inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Sensitivity to antibodies in serum was tested using convalescent sera from recovered individuals collected as part of the Cambridge NIHR Bioresource. We also performed phylogenetic analyses of data available publicly in GISAID.</p>
<p>Ethical approval for use of serum samples. Controls with COVID-19 were enrolled to the NIHR BioResource Centre Cambridge under ethics review board (17/EE/0025).</p>
<p>All available full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database (https://gisaid.org/; Shu and McCauley, 2017) on 16 th February 2021. Low-quality sequences (&gt; 5% N regions) were removed, leaving a dataset of 491,395 sequences with a length of &gt; 29,000bp. Sequences were deduplicated and then filtered to find the mutations of interest. All sequences were realigned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain MN908947.3, using MAFFT v7.475 with automatic strategy selection and the-keeplength-addfragments options (Katoh and Standley, 2013) Serum pseudotype neutralization assay Spike pseudotype assays have been shown to have similar characteristics as neutralization testing using fully infectious wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (Schmidt et al., 2020).Virus neutralization assays were performed on 293T cell transiently transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase (Mlcochova et al., 2020). Pseudotyped virus was incubated with serial dilution of heat inactivated human serum samples or convalescent plasma in duplicate for 1h at 37 C. Virus and cell only controls were also included. Then, freshly trypsinized 293T ACE2/TMPRSS2 expressing cells were added to each well. Following 48h incubation in a 5% CO 2 environment at 37 C, the luminescence was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega). Case et al., 2020). Next, 3 contiguous overlapping fragments were fused by a first overlap PCR (step 2) using the utmost external primers of each set, resulting in 3 larger fragments with overlapping sequences. A final overlap PCR (step 3) was performed on the 3 large fragments using the utmost external primers to amplify the full-length S gene and the flanking sequences including the restriction sites KpnI and NotI. This fragment was digested and cloned into the expression plasmid phCMV1. For all PCR reactions the Q5 Hot Start High fidelity DNA polymerase was used (New England Biolabs Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions and adapting the elongation time to the size of the amplicon. After each PCR step the amplified regions were separated on agarose gel and purified using Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Merck KGaA).</p>
<p>Human mAbs were isolated from plasma cells or memory B cells of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 immune donors. Recombinant antibodies were expressed in ExpiCHO cells at 37 C and 8% CO2. Cells were transfected using ExpiFectamine. Transfected cells were supplemented 1 day after transfection with ExpiCHO Feed and ExpiFectamine CHO Enhancer. Cell culture supernatant was collected eight days after transfection and filtered through a 0.2 mm filter. Recombinant antibodies were affinity purified on an A ¨KTA xpress FPLC device using 5 mL HiTrap MabSelect PrismA columns followed by buffer exchange to Histidine buffer (20 mM Histidine, 8% sucrose, pH 6) using HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns.</p>
<p>Pseudovirus neutralization assay for testing NTD monoclonal antibodies MLV-based SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein-pseudotyped viruses were prepared as previously described (Pinto, 2020). HEK293T/ 17cells were cotransfected with a WT, B.1.1.7 or B.1.1.7 H69/V70 SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-encoding-plasmid, an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the MLV transfer vector encoding a luciferase reporter using X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured for 72 h at 37 C with 5% CO 2 before harvesting the supernatant. VeroE6 stably expressing human TMPRSS2 were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (100 I.U. penicillin/mL, 100 mg/mL), 8 mg/mL puromycin and plated into 96-well plates for 16-24 h. Pseudovirus with serial dilution of mAbs was incubated for 1 h at 37 C and then added to the wells after washing 2 times with DMEM. After 2-3 h DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin was added to the cells. Following 48-72 h of infection, Bio-Glo (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 15 min before reading luminescence with Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). Measurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression model to determine IC 50 values using

The 50% inhibitory dilution (EC 50 ) was defined as the serum dilution at which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus + cells) after subtraction of the background RLUs in the control groups with cells only. The EC 50 values were calculated with non-linear regression, log (inhibitor) versus normalized response using

The neutralization assay was positive if the serum achieved at least 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus in the neutralization assay. The neutralization result was negative if it failed to achieve 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution. Statistical tests are described in the figure legends along with the value of n, mean, and standard deviation/error. Data were normally distributed consistent with statistical methods used.
