        <p>t present, the widespread usage of wearable medical data collection and surveillance devices, including but not limited to the intelligent bracelet, blood glucose monitor and defibrillator, leads to massive amounts of private data being generated. In the meantime, the emergence of social platforms has facilitated the convenient dissemination of data, thereby boosting their accessibility. With this comes the increasing concern of users about the privacy and security of data. In addition, digital image with vivid, visual, and intuitive features has become one of the most popular multimedia data formats. In this context, preventing digital images from divulging user-privacy-related information becomes extremely challenging for cryptologists owing to their large data volume, high redundancy, and strong relevance.

        <p>The remarkable advances in compressive sensing technology have promoted a tremendous success in the privacy preservation field.

        <p>From a cryptographic point of view, the CS-based information acquisition system can be considered as a variant of symmetric cryptosystem to some extent (Zhu, 2022a). More specifically, it is known to all that a basic cryptosystem comprises five primary components, namely, plaintext, ciphertext, secret key, encryption and decryption processes. Moreover, these correspond precisely to original signal, measured signal, measurement matrix, sampling and reconstruction processes in the CS theory. However, note that the remarkable discrepancy between them is that the latter is an irreversible system. Afterward, it has gained unprecedented advancements in the information security field (Xue, 2021).From a cryptographic point of view, the CS-based information acquisition system can be considered as a variant of symmetric cryptosystem to some extent (Zhu, 2022a).

        <p>The research on applying CS technology to digital image encryption can be traced back to as early as around 2008. For example, Kumar et al. projected the plain image after linear transform operation onto a random Gaussian matrix to implement synchronized compression and encryption of data. Later, the original image is reconstructed with high probability at the decoding end by means of the modified basis pursuit approach (Kumar and Makur, 2009). Although there exist several shortcomings, such as high burden of key transmission and low image fidelity, it is admittedly a successful attempt. Moreover, the similar drawbacks are also present in (Huang and Sakurai, 2011). To tackle the first above-mentioned issue, scholars have successively introduced a variety of approaches to construct the deterministic measurement matrices, including chaotic measurement matrix (Sethi, 2022;Zhang, 2022), restricted structural random matrix (Canh and Jeon, 2021), expander-graphs-based measurement matrix (Jafarpour, 2009), and so on, thereby eliminating the constraint condition of transmitting whole stochastic measurement matrix that is viewed as a shared key. Regarding the second issue, (Xiao, 2021;Hua, 2021;Zhu, 2022b) coincidentally exploited the adaptive thresholding mechanism to ameliorate the sparsity of the transform domain coefficients which in turn enhances the fidelity of reconstructed image. In other aspects, (Fang, 2014) revealed that performing scrambling manipulation on 2-D sparse data before compressed sampling parallelly can significantly relax the constraint of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Whereafter, various CS models with distinctive features, such as 2-D CS (Yang, 2022), semi-tensor product CS (Niu, 2020) and Bayesian CS (Zhu, 2022a), were successively applied into privacy protection.The research on applying CS technology to digital image encryption can be traced back to as early as around 2008.

        <p>Besides its application level, some scholars have also comprehensively analyzed the security level of the CS technology. It has been mentioned in (Rachlin and Baron, 2008;Hossein, 2012) that although it cannot guarantee the absolute security of sampled data in terms of information theory, it can make the brute force attacks against key or ciphertext computationally infeasible. Furthermore, its compressed sampling process is a linear projection process in essence (Zhu, 2020), which means it is effortless for the illegitimate attacker to figure out a particular employed measurement matrix, when he/she holds sufficient plaintext-ciphertext pairs. To arrive at a higher secure level, the CS-based symmetric cryptosystems would require updating key frequently, even using the onetime-pad pattern. Apparently, it will instead contribute to the serious data disaster. More importantly, it is contrary to the design concept of the CS. At this moment, a feasible solution is to adopt the counter mechanism against the powerful chosenplaintext attacks (Hu, 2017).Besides its application level, some scholars have also comprehensively analyzed the security level of the CS technology.

        <p>In the previous paragraphs, we have reviewed minutely the CS technology applied to the privacy protection field from the aspects of application and security levels, respectively. Although, outstanding advances have been made after more than a decade of development, there remain certain issues that have been overlooked by us over the long-term. One of them is the demand for designing an adaptive sparse representation model. To be more specific, the existing CS-based encryption schemes all adopt static (or fixed) orthogonal bases to sparsely represent plain images, including but not limited to Fourier basis, wavelet basis, Gabor basis, and Contourlet basis. Nevertheless, it is well known that the sparsity of natural images with identical texture complexity is not consistent over distinct orthogonal bases. Undoubtedly, the selection of a sparse representation basis is crucial in the design of a security system, as it can significantly affect both the execution efficiency and the reconstruction quality. Inspired by this, we have carried out a series of experiments on image sparse representation proceed from data content itself. As a result, the contributing and innovative points of this work are threefold, summarized as follows:In the previous paragraphs, we have reviewed minutely the CS technology applied to the privacy protection field from the aspects of application and security levels, respectively.

(4) Comparison of quantitative security performance: In the preceding sub-sections, the proposed medical data encryption scheme is analyzed minutely from multiple perspectives of security, respectively. Next, we will quantitatively compare our scheme with the existing state-of-the-art schemes from the aspects of correlation coefficient, NPCR, UACI, and key space. Following the mainstream comparative approach, the image "Lena" with resolution of is selected as plain image to 512 512  be encrypted in the performed experiments and the adopted secret keys are consistent with those described in Section 6.1. Eventually, the numerical results are elaborated in Table II. Besides, it is worth noting that the simulation results of the comparison scheme are derived from references.</p>
        <p>By comparing the numerical values of the security performance metrics for all schemes separately, it is observed that the cipher image yielding from our scheme has a considerably lower level of correlation coefficient. Its NPCR and UACI values are more closely approximated to the expected values. Apart from that, our scheme possesses other superiorities, such as the single-round encryption mechanism to diminish the time expenditure and the compression-encryption architecture, thereby enhancing its transmission efficiency.By comparing the numerical values of the security performance metrics for all schemes separately, it is observed that the cipher image yielding from our scheme has a considerably lower level of correlation coefficient.

        <p>When considering together, it can be concluded that the proposed medical data cryptosystem can more effectively withstand a variety of commonly used attack paradigms, including statistical attack, differential attack, and exhaustive attack.When considering together, it can be concluded that the proposed medical data cryptosystem can more effectively withstand a variety of commonly used attack paradigms, including statistical attack, differential attack, and exhaustive attack.</p>
        <p>Besides its security, robustness is also an essential criterion for the performance of an algorithm, which is motivated by the realistic channel conditions. In general, we adopt three types of noise, namely, Salt &amp; Pepper Noise (SPN), Speckle Noise (SN) and Gaussian Noise (GN), as well as Data Cropping (DC) to simulate the channel noise and the data packet loss. Not surprisingly, we load each of these four emulated attacks with different normalization strengths onto cipher image. Later, the corresponding reconstructed images are presented in Fig. 13. Apparently, the decrypted images recovered from the contaminated cipher images are visually semantic and recognizable, indicating that the proposed scheme possesses a certain degree of immunity to these four attacks. Besides, it is worth taking a moment to clearly explain the influence of diffusion operation, the essential component of cryptosystem, on the robustness of an algorithm. The purpose of this component is to spread the elements of plaintext to the whole ciphertext as much as possible. In turn, the tampered ciphertext will affect the reconstructed plaintext to some extent. Given that medical image is of ultra-redundant and semantic properties, therefore reconstructed image will certainly contain a certain amount of raw plaintext information.Besides its security, robustness is also an essential criterion for the performance of an algorithm, which is motivated by the realistic channel conditions.

        <p>Finally, let us analyze the execution efficiency of the proposed encryption scheme. Given that there exist multiple factors affecting the encryption time, including but not limited to central processor, simulation platform and parallel computing, we first evaluate the percentage of each part of the encryption scheme to the total manipulation time, as depicted in Fig. 14. Secondly, its time complexity is calculated. As can be seen in Fig. 14, the time cost for solving the chaotic trajectories of the proposed PDE-ReLU-MHNN model accounts for more than 89% of the total manipulation time. In the practical application scenarios, the cipher flows can be prestored into the random-access memory of medical devices to economize on time over-head and computational resources. Inversely, the time expenditure for the other parts is comparatively lower.Finally, let us analyze the execution efficiency of the proposed encryption scheme.

        <p>In this paper, we proposed a novel adaptive sparse basis compressive sensing model by leveraging SVD approach for medical image manipulation, aimed at addressing users' concerns regarding the security of their personal medical data. The proposed data encryption scheme involves three phases. First, we exploit the hyperchaotic property of the newly designed PDE-ReLU-MHNN model to construct unpredictable cipher flows and random seeds for generating a hardwarefriendly measurement matrix. Afterward, with the assistance of the hashing algorithm, the plain medical image is adaptively compressed through the ASB-CS model. Next, the bidirectional nonlinear diffusion manipulation is applied on the compressed image to yield an unrecognizable cipher image. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed data encryption scheme is evaluated from multiple perspectives, including reconstruction performance, security, robustness, and execution efficiency. Moreover, the comparative results indicate that our scheme is comparable to existing state-of-the-art schemes. In future research, we intend to investigate a convenient approach for transferring the sparse representation matrix to alleviate the transmission burden.In this paper, we proposed a novel adaptive sparse basis compressive sensing model by leveraging SVD approach for medical image manipulation, aimed at addressing users' concerns regarding the security of their personal medical data.
