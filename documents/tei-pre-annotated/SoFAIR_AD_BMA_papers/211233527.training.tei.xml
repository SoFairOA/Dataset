        <p>In India, Land records can be defined as a generic expression that may include records such as, the Records of Rights (RoRs), tenancy and crop inspection register, mutation register, disputed cases register, etc. Land Records also include geographical information of each parcel of land with its boundary, size, soil-type of the land; and economic information related to irrigation and crops (Bal. Meghana, 2017). Land Titling is a form of land reform in which individuals and families are given formal property rights for land which they have previously occupied informally, or used on the basis of customary land tenure.In India, Land records can be defined as a generic expression that may include records such as, the Records of Rights (RoRs), tenancy and crop inspection register, mutation register, disputed cases register, etc. Land Records also include geographical information of each parcel of land with its boundary, size, soil-type of the land; and economic information related to irrigation and crops (Bal.

        <p>The National Land Record Modernization Programme (NLRMP) was launched by Government of India in August 2008 with aim to develop a modern, comprehensive and transparent land records management system in the country which ensures guaranteed conclusive Land Titling of the immovable properties (http://dolr.nic.in). The programme was later revamped and reintroduced as Digital India-Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP) in the year 2014 to establish a modern and efficient land records management system in the country. This requires real time updated land records for maintenance of conclusive Land Titling system with title guarantee (Vinay et al, 2019).The National Land Record Modernization Programme (NLRMP) was launched by Government of India in August 2008 with aim to develop a modern, comprehensive and transparent land records management system in the country which ensures guaranteed conclusive Land Titling of the immovable properties (http://dolr.nic.in).

        <p>Most of the States have successfully implemented the digitization of the existing Land Records and computerization of property registration offices. However, these computerized systems work in standalone mode and there is a lack of trustworthy eco-system for managing transactions and updating the records. The need of trusted and efficient ecosystem can be addressed by using Blockchain based system. In this paper, the issues related to implementation of a Blockchain based system for maintaining and integrating various sub systems like land records, registration, banks, survey, settlements and courts are described for implementation by the States.

        <p>Land Record Management has gone through several reforms like Zamindari Abolition Act (confiscating land from land lords i.e. Zamindars), Land Ceiling Act (to redistribute surplus land to the landless), tribal ownership rights etc. after independence. The land is State subject hence the procedure of land records management differs from State to State. Records-of-Rights (RoR) are maintained in Tehsil/Mandal (sub-district administrative unit) office and are not updated frequently. As land records maintenance involves land related details, maps plan and land registration, the records maintenance is done by three State Departments/agencies i.e. Land Records Department, Survey Department and Registration Departments in the States. As each department works in its own standalone manner, records updated in one Department makes it outdated for the other Department. Transactions of land are recorded but the ownership titles remain presumptive. This gives scope for fraudulent transactions such as double sale, sale by non-owners, unknown buyers (benami), back-dated transactions and so on. About 40 percent of disputes in various courts are related to illegal encroachments, title disputes etc. Land/property can be transferred from one party to another through sale/purchase, land acquisition, inheritance, court orders, bank mortgage as detailed below.Land Record Management has gone through several reforms like Zamindari Abolition Act (confiscating land from land lords i.e. Zamindars), Land Ceiling Act (to redistribute surplus land to the landless), tribal ownership rights etc. after independence.

        <p>In India, ownership updation mainly happens through sale transaction which is done through registration of deeds. The registration systems are generally classified into two major categories i.e. Deed registration and Title registration (Aggarwal, 2018). In 'Deed Registration', a written conveyance deed is executed between the parties and is registered at registrar office. This registered deed is the proof of transaction in the property and serves for the purpose of maintaining land records. The Transfer of Property Act 1882 gives the right to transfer or selling of an immovable property through registered document. One can get the transaction registered but land title is not guaranteed. The ownership is established through a registered sale deed and some other documents like property tax receipts, survey documents, RoR documents etc.In India, ownership updation mainly happens through sale transaction which is done through registration of deeds.

        <p>Land Acquisition is another process wherein agricultural and/or non-agricultural lands are acquired by the Government for various developmental activities such as village/town extension, construction and/or development of roads, culverts, reservoirs, canals, military camps, railways and industries. The Land Acquisition Act 1894 governs the process of acquisition of land in public interest, which is a central act. The land privately owned and occupied by the citizens and non-governmental organizations are subjected to acquisition. The Land Records System helps in finding the land owners and types &amp; extent of land and Land Acquisition System helps in speedy land acquisition and settlement of the dues and disputes. After the notification of the land and acquisition of the land, the title and ownership gets updated in the respective land registers (known as Khasra and Khatoni in majority of States).Land Acquisition is another process wherein agricultural and/or non-agricultural lands are acquired by the Government for various developmental activities such as village/town extension, construction and/or development of roads, culverts, reservoirs, canals, military camps, railways and industries.

        <p>• The existing land records available in the country are not clear, poorly administered and often do not reflect the ground reality. The maintenance and availability of information of land records are few of the critical challenges faced by the Government. The major factors behind such inadequate systems are their derivation from the ancient 'zamindari' system. Additionally, the current legal framework of India does not ensure guarantee of ownership. This information is updated and stored by different Departments at the district or village level. The data among these Departments is not synchronized regularly which creates discrepancies in the records and often the information on the documents mismatches with the ground position. The poor handling of the processes of land transaction and record keeping affects the management of land markets in the country (Aggarwal, 2018).• The existing land records available in the country are not clear, poorly administered and often do not reflect the ground reality.

        <p>Any particular property has few elements like khatano (owner account number), khata owner (owner name), owner's father, address, khasrano (parcel ID), total area, buyer, buyer father and area to buy. So new class is being created known as addNewProperty. When the property is registered for the first time in its records is pushed into the block with hash. Next,when the owner sells his property then, it takes the details of the buyer and how much (area) he/she wants to buy. The same information is stored it with current hash along with the previous hash. If iii) Its immutable nature makes it hard to modify anything at later stage: The immutable nature of transactions in Blockchain Technology makes a fear in the minds of the employees and they (revenue functionaries) tend to continue with the existing computerized systems rather than adopting the new technology.Any particular property has few elements like khatano (owner account number), khata owner (owner name), owner's father, address, khasrano (parcel ID), total area, buyer, buyer father and area to buy.

        <p>iv) There would be an issue of key management especially in private Blockchain: The Government PKI infrastructure and eSign mechanism (http://cca.gov.in) is not associated in key management in case of public Blockchain implementations yet. In case of private Blockchain there is no guidelines, till now regarding the usage of keys or key management from Government of India. There are instances of closure of the existing PKI infrastructures because of cyber attacks and security lapses.iv) There would be an issue of key management especially in private Blockchain: The Government PKI infrastructure and eSign mechanism (http://cca.gov.in) is not associated in key management in case of public Blockchain implementations yet.

        <p>v) There are no regulatory standards that govern application across jurisdiction. There are no regulations on how the transactions should be written: The minimum set of attributes required for recording a transaction is not fixed by any regulatory body in India. So for a implementation of a Blockchain Technology there should be identified, minimum set of attributes by a implementor State for each sectors. Decisions like the number of Blockchains that can be maintained needs to finalized by an approving or recommending organization. May be theme wise Blockchains can be maintained. In present land records maintenance eco-system we are maintaining single Blockchain for all the transactions. The infrastructure requirements get increased in case there is a need to maintain number of Blockchains based on themes.v) There are no regulatory standards that govern application across jurisdiction.

        <p>vii) The initial cost of set up of massive network for the implementation of Blockchain requires high initial cost: The establishments of a network with required bandwidth to maintain the nodes is a big task. In India the network availability is still very low. Further, the databases for land records are still maintained at District Levels/Taluk levels in many States. The updation of land records data is still carried out in the Taluk level officers where the Tehsildar is the custodian of the basic registers.vii) The initial cost of set up of massive network for the implementation of Blockchain requires high initial cost: The establishments of a network with required bandwidth to maintain the nodes is a big task.

        <p>viii) A successful Blockchain network that consists of huge records of ledger may suffer from latency issues: The need of network and the interactions of the nodes with the traditional database servers are required for the complete knowledge about the transactions and the various entities associated with the transactions. There is a need of high-end servers not only to cater to the exiting load but also the extra connections required for replication of the transactions to all the participating nodes. Further the layout nodes and its efficient implementations are yet to be explored and become difficult in case of non-availability of implementations. For example, in private Blockchain implementations, one can create multiple channels to facilitate a group of nodes and isolate them from the others to meet the business requirements. The multiple channels have to be incorporated with multiple smart contracts. The judicious use of business rules and smart contracts are highly essential for a successful implementation of the Blockchain.viii) A successful Blockchain network that consists of huge records of ledger may suffer from latency issues: The need of network and the interactions of the nodes with the traditional database servers are required for the complete knowledge about the transactions and the various entities associated with the transactions.

        <p>In India, maintenance of land records and it's regular updation has been a challenging task. The citizens even lack confidence in the existing systems prevalent in the States.

        <p>The Blockchain Technology gives us chance to fix many of these problems and provides cascading benefits. The solutions suggested in this paper incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as: an immutable history of transactional records, so no one can ever doubt the authenticity; records are permanently linked to the system so no one can ever tamper with or forge a record of their own; and these records can be seen by any party, at any time. It is powerful and validating.The Blockchain Technology gives us chance to fix many of these problems and provides cascading benefits.

        <p>The introduction of Blockchain Technology for land ownership and land registration process will bring clarity in ownership, valuation and reduce fraudulent transactions. This will also lead to better land management and conveyancing and enhance the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. Blockchain Technology will also facilitate achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Hughes et al. 2019). The correct and secured land records will strengthen the SDG goals including Peace Justice and strong institutions, as institutions will be effective and more accountable as the land transactions will be non-repudiable and open to all.The introduction of Blockchain Technology for land ownership and land registration process will bring clarity in ownership, valuation and reduce fraudulent transactions.

        <p>The paper suggests leveraging the inherent benefits of the Blockchain, with a focus on smart contracts. The system will capture and permanently record each transaction done either through sale of a property, inheritance, court orders, land acquisition etc. This means you achieve near real-time updated records with accurate traceability and transparency into the state of the property records. This will create a single source of truth of ownership status and history of a property transaction. The buyer will be assured that the land being bought is the correct plot, and that the seller is unequivocally the owner, reducing the potential of forgery and disputes, as well as the costs and time involved, for any given transaction and paving way to implement conclusive Land Titling system with title guarantee in the country.The paper suggests leveraging the inherent benefits of the Blockchain, with a focus on smart contracts.

        <p>without involving any third party like banks in between. The decentralized distributed structures make it possible to distribute trust among all the nodes involved in the transaction. All nodes download and store the copy of each single transaction made in the network. The 'proof of work' algorithm makes the complete process secured and hence tampering and hacking is less likely to be occurred. Contracts can be encoded on any Blockchain, but Ethereum is most favored as it gives unlimited processing capability.
