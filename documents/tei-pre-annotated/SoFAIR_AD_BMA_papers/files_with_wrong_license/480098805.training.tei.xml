        <p>The aim of this paper is to investigate whether banks adopt Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices to reduce reputational damage due to financial penalties and whether the adoption of ESG factors can reduce the probability to receive sanctions. This study extends a previous research (Guerello et al., North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 2018, 48, 591-612) by including ESG scores as determinant of the probability to be sanctioned. The econometric analyses in this paper are based on a sample of 13 Italian banks for the years 2008-2018 and includes ESG scores provided by both Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg. The research shows that ESG score and the probability of sanctions are positively related.The aim of this paper is to investigate whether banks adopt Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices to reduce reputational damage due to financial penalties and whether the adoption of ESG factors can reduce the probability to receive sanctions.

        <p>However, a careful analysis of causal directions clarifies the meaning of such positive relationship: receiving financial penalties is detrimental for banks reputations, therefore it's necessary for banks to improve their reputation through the adoption of ESG practices.However, a careful analysis of causal directions clarifies the meaning of such positive relationship: receiving financial penalties is detrimental for banks reputations, therefore it's necessary for banks to improve their reputation through the adoption of ESG practices.</p>
        <p>In recent years, banks, financial markets, and public authorities showed a growing attention for sustainable finance. In this view, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)activities are currently included in the business models of an increasing number of financial intermediaries.In recent years, banks, financial markets, and public authorities showed a growing attention for sustainable finance. In this view, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)activities are currently included in the business models of an increasing number of financial intermediaries.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the perceived relevance of financial sustainability is mainly due to the commitment of the European Commission to boost the integration of ESG parameters into all aspects of the financial system. For example, among the initiatives put in place by the Commission, the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance and the High-Level Expert Group have been recently established with the aim to assist the EU sustainable regulatory program. In particular, the Technical Expert Group pursues the objective to support the European Commission in developing (a) an EU taxonomy for environmentally sustainable activities (European Commission, 2018), (b) an EU Green Bond Standard in order to guarantee the comparison and the transparency of the Green Bonds, (c) methodologies for EU climate benchmarks and (d) guidelines to improve corporate disclosure on climate related information. On the other side, the High Level Expert Group on sustainable finance is a task force composed by 20 senior experts with the mandate to assist the European Commission in steering the public and private capital to more sustainable investments and to classify the steps that supervisory authorities and institutions should take to ensure the stability of the system from environmental risks. In addition, the European Commission recently published the "Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth" to strengthen ESG companies' disclosure and to define a clearer taxonomy of sustainable activities.In Europe, the perceived relevance of financial sustainability is mainly due to the commitment of the European Commission to boost the integration of ESG parameters into all aspects of the financial system.

        <p>The adoption of ESG factors among financial intermediaries is also driven by the fact that all the initiatives introduced by the European Commission will be soon shared by supervisory authorities and will radically change banks' activity. For example, according to the European Banking Authority (2019), banks will soon integrate ESG parameters in their risk processes and credit policies in order to face transitional and physical risks intended respectively as (a) the financial impact due to climate changes and (b) the potential financial loss that can result from the process of adaption toward more environmentally sustainable practices (i.e., market sentiment, technological process) (European Central Bank, 2020;Signorini, 2019).The adoption of ESG factors among financial intermediaries is also driven by the fact that all the initiatives introduced by the European Commission will be soon shared by supervisory authorities and will radically change banks' activity.

        <p>These considerations suggest that this new approach will probably affect the current prudential framework and therefore ESG activities will become strategic for both banks and public authorities. Furthermore, it is widely believed that financial intermediaries should not be considered only as producers of financial values, but also as drivers of a more sustainable development (Wilson, 1999), for which the inclusion of ESG factors in their activities seems to be necessary.These considerations suggest that this new approach will probably affect the current prudential framework and therefore ESG activities will become strategic for both banks and public authorities.

        <p>It should be noted that among the causes of the development of ESG practices among financial intermediaries, the financial crisis played a crucial role. Indeed, the crisis has severely affected the banking system and consequently credit institutions have begun to adopt these practices not honestly but with the aim to mainly re-store their confidence between customers.It should be noted that among the causes of the development of ESG practices among financial intermediaries, the financial crisis played a crucial role.

        <p>Taking into account these considerationsand considering the fact that ESG activities are widely recognized by academic literature (see, among others, Gangi, Daniele, and Varrone (2020), Lin, Zeng, Wang, Zou, and Ma (2016), Gallardo-Vázquez, Valdez-Juarez, and Castuera-Diaz (2019), Dell'Atti, Trotta, Iannuzzi, and Demaria (2017)) among the numerous variables that can affect reputationour aim is to analyse how the adoption of ESG practices impacts on banks' probability of sanctions and to explore the relationship between ESG and reputation on Italian sanctioned banks. In that regard, we aim to investigate if the adoption of ESG practices can reduce compliance risk through its reputational effects. Indeed, compliance risk is defined as "the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, codes of conduct and standards of good practice" and therefore as the union of both reputational and financial components (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), 2003).Taking into account these considerationsand considering the fact that ESG activities are widely recognized by academic literature (see, among others, Gangi, Daniele, and Varrone (2020), Lin, Zeng, Wang, Zou, and Ma (2016), Gallardo-Vázquez, Valdez-Juarez, and Castuera-Diaz (2019), Dell'Atti, Trotta, Iannuzzi, and Demaria (2017)) among the numerous variables that can affect reputationour aim is to analyse how the adoption of ESG practices impacts on banks' probability of sanctions and to explore the relationship between ESG and reputation on Italian sanctioned banks.

        <p>In this paper we assess the impact of ESG activities on the probability for an Italian bank to incur into a sanction. A similar approach has been followed by Guerello, Murè, Rovo, and Spallone (2018) whose focus is on the impact of balance sheet items and accounting ratios on the probability to be sanctioned. In order to disentangle the relationship between ESG and probability to be sanctioned, we obviously need to control for variables other than ESG that affect such a probability. Therefore, we heavily rely on the analysis in Guerello et al. (2018) and in that we use their selection of accounting ratios and balance sheet items as a starting point for variables selection in our econometric analysis.In this paper we assess the impact of ESG activities on the probability for an Italian bank to incur into a sanction.

        <p>As for our knowledge, nobody studied the relationship between sanctions and ESG activities, notwithstanding the fact that both sanctions and ESG activities determine reputational effects. As for ESG, literature can be divided in four streams of work.As for our knowledge, nobody studied the relationship between sanctions and ESG activities, notwithstanding the fact that both sanctions and ESG activities determine reputational effects.

        <p>The first workflow analyses the link between corporate risk and ESG factors: for example, Gangi, Meles, D'Angelo, and Daniele (2018) explore the relationship between environmental engagement and corporate risk on a sample of 142 banks and verify that banks that are more sensitive to environmental issues are also less risky while Sassen, Hinze, and Hardeck (2016) investigate the impact of corporate social performanceintended as ESGon risk firm. In particular, analyzing idiosyncratic, systemic, and total risk, they find that aggregated ESG score decreases total and idiosyncratic risk while social factor decreases all the three categories of risk. Di Tommaso and Thorton (2020) identify that (a) ESG score is usually associated to a modest reduction in risk taking and that (b) the impact of the ESG depends mainly on board's characteristic while Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) verify through meta-analysis verify that corporate social performance reduces financial risk.The first workflow analyses the link between corporate risk and ESG factors: for example, Gangi, Meles, D'Angelo, and Daniele (2018) explore the relationship between environmental engagement and corporate risk on a sample of 142 banks and verify that banks that are more sensitive to environmental issues are also less risky while Sassen, Hinze, and Hardeck (2016) investigate the impact of corporate social performanceintended as ESGon risk firm.

        <p>The second field of work investigates the relationship between ESG factors and corporate performance. On this aspect, Xie, Nozawa, Yagi, Fujii, and Shunaukw (2018) investigate the relationship between corporate efficiency and corporate sustainability in order to determine whether the adoption of the three ESG factors can increase corporate profitability or not; Friede, Busch, and Bassen (2015) through a study which combined the results of more than 2000 empirical studies conclude that 90% of academic studies found a non-negative and stable relationship between corporate financial performance and ESG; Esteban-Sanchez, de la Cuesta-Gonzalez, and Paredes-Gazquez (2017)The second field of work investigates the relationship between ESG factors and corporate performance.

        <p>The third workflow examines the impact of ESG factors on market performance and on portfolio strategies: Verheyden, Eccles, and Feiner (2016) find that ESG screening increases risk-adjusted returns and likewise Sherwood and Pollard (2017) demonstrate that the integration of ESG markets equities in institutional portfolios could provide higher returns for investors. Deng and Cheng (2019) on a sample of Chinese listed companiesdemonstrate a positive relationship between enterprise's ESG indices and its stock market performance.The third workflow examines the impact of ESG factors on market performance and on portfolio strategies: Verheyden, Eccles, and Feiner (2016) find that ESG screening increases risk-adjusted returns and likewise Sherwood and Pollard (2017) demonstrate that the integration of ESG markets equities in institutional portfolios could provide higher returns for investors.

        <p>The last stream of work is focused on the divergence of ESG ratings and measures, and on the need to uniform and standardize this framework across jurisdictions (Berg, Kolbel, &amp; Rigobon, 2019;Eccles &amp; Stroehle, 2018;Escrig-Olmedo, Rivera-Lirio, Munoz-Torres, &amp; Fernandez-Izquierdo, 2017;Huber et al., 2017). In this context, it is worth mentioning an additional stream of work which studies the impact of climate change on banks' activity. In that regard, several studies also confirm that climate change can have a relevant impact on credit management (Georgopoulou et al., 2014) and that a standardized prudential framework is necessary to mitigate the potential effects on financial stability (Nieto, 2019). Moreover, some researches state that climate changes can affect not only banks' activity, but also financial stability objectives of central banks (Batten, Sowerbutts, &amp; Tanaka, 2016;Campiglio et al., 2018;Monnin, 2018).The last stream of work is focused on the divergence of ESG ratings and measures, and on the need to uniform and standardize this framework across jurisdictions (Berg, Kolbel, &amp; Rigobon, 2019;Eccles &amp; Stroehle, 2018;Escrig-Olmedo, Rivera-Lirio, Munoz-Torres, &amp; Fernandez-Izquierdo, 2017;Huber et al., 2017).

        <p>Regarding sanctions, most of the literature has investigated the relationship between financial penalties and banks' performance in terms of efficiency and productivity (Danisewicz, McGowan, Onali, &amp; Schaeck, 2018;Guerello et al., 2018;Koster &amp; Pelster, 2017;Murè, Pesic, &amp; Lo, 2011), while others have examined the role of financial penalties from a macroeconomic point of view, and in particular their impact on banks' failures (Delis, Staikouras, &amp; Tsoumas, 2017) and on liquidity and credit channels (Deli, Delis, Hasan, &amp; Liu, 2016). As for governance, Cotugno, D'Amato, Gallo, and Stefanelli (2017) proves that financial penalties increase board's member expertise. It is worth mentioning a relevant study conducted by Utz (2019) in which the author studies the reliability of ESG assessment in predicting corporate scandals on a sample of international firms ESG ratings are useless in predicting these accidents.Regarding sanctions, most of the literature has investigated the relationship between financial penalties and banks' performance in terms of efficiency and productivity (Danisewicz, McGowan, Onali, &amp; Schaeck, 2018;Guerello et al., 2018;Koster &amp; Pelster, 2017;Murè, Pesic, &amp; Lo, 2011), while others have examined the role of financial penalties from a macroeconomic point of view, and in particular their impact on banks' failures (Delis, Staikouras, &amp; Tsoumas, 2017) and on liquidity and credit channels (Deli, Delis, Hasan, &amp; Liu, 2016).

        <p>As regarding reputation, several studies have been conducted on the potential relationship between reputation and ethical practices, but as for our knowledge nobody investigated the relationship between ESG, sanctions and reputation: Gangi et al.

The first oneafter a literature review which reveals that the relationship between corporate social responsibility and corporate reputation has been mainly investigated from empirical sideprovides a conceptual analysis to identify how academic literature explains the relationship between CSR and organizational reputation, while the second one explore the relationship between the two variables through value theory and find that value priorities are crucial for CSR activities and corporate reputation. Focusing the attention on banking sector, Dell 'Atti et al. (2017) confirm a positive relationship between banking reputation and social scores and conclude that sustainable practices are able to strength banks' reputation and similarly Forcadell and Aracil (2017) demonstrate the positive effect of CSR reputation on a sample of banks listed Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Closing, Trotta and Cavallaro (2012) examine that reputation is relevant for the banking sector because financial services and operations are mainly based on trust relationship.As regarding reputation, several studies have been conducted on the potential relationship between reputation and ethical practices, but as for our knowledge nobody investigated the relationship between ESG, sanctions and reputation: Gangi et al.

        <p>Figure 1 It is worth to remark that the overall level of the ESG score exhibits an increasing trend in the same years of the increasing trend in sanctions. In particular, the two variables tend to increase when penalties are less attributable to a recession and, therefore, are less likely attributable to worsening general condition. Thus, from an aggregate perspective, it could be conjectured that in the initial years of the sample, that is, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, sanctions are related to systemic shocks and therefore do not signal bankspecific critical issues. On the contrary, in the last years sanctions represent symptoms of idiosyncratic bank-specific issues that are therefore signaled to market through penalties.

        <p>Thomson Reuters score that we used, it is generally true that controversies may affect ESG scores, also indirectly through their impact on other variables. In that case, the relationship between the latent variable "controversy/sanction" and the ESG score would apparently be negative. Therefore, the fact that we get a positive sign between sanctions and ESG is even more striking. In fact, a sanction lowers the ESG index of a bank. Thus, if no reputational effect existed, because of such an endogenous effect we would get a negative (and possibly significant) sign with no statistical explanatory power. Since we get a strong positive estimate, we can conjecture that the reputational effect (i.e., the causal effect from ESG to sanction) is larger than the direct effect.Thomson Reuters score that we used, it is generally true that controversies may affect ESG scores, also indirectly through their impact on other variables.

Since we get a strong positive estimate, we can conjecture that the reputational effect (i.e., the causal effect from ESG to sanction) is larger than the direct effect.</p>
        <p>In order to overcome potential issues related to endogeneity, we fit a model for the relationship between the probability of sanctions and ESG scores by using lagged values of ESG scores as instruments for ESG at current time. In fact, lagged values are correlated with ESG scores at current time, while they cannot be directly indirectly affected by sanctions occurring in the future.In order to overcome potential issues related to endogeneity, we fit a model for the relationship between the probability of sanctions and ESG scores by using lagged values of ESG scores as instruments for ESG at current time.

        <p>The model is structurally similar to the one fitted in the previous section, despite the estimator is quite different. In fact, in order to take into account the effect of the instrument, we adopted a pooled probit maximum likelihood estimator by correcting standard errors for intra-group correlation. Moreover, given the reduction in the number of available observations due to the utilization of lags as instruments, we had to reduce the number of coefficients to be estimated in order to keep an adequate ratio between observations and required degrees of freedom. The set of regressors used in the pooled IV probit estimation is described in Table 4. Such groups of regressors are a subset of those used in the main estimations in the previous section. Some of them have been excluded on a statistical significance basis, while still keeping an adequate representations of the main operational areas of a bank.The model is structurally similar to the one fitted in the previous section, despite the estimator is quite different.

        <p>We get similar results with the IV model in terms of significance and sign of the ESG regressor. Moreover, the Wald test for exogeneity of specification in column (7) (i.e., the one with the lowest values of the information criteria) reports a statistic equal to 1.15 distributed as a chi-squared with one degree of freedom, thus implying a p-value of .28. p-values for the same test related to specifications in ( 8) and ( 9) are, respectively, .24 and .13, Therefore, the null hypothesis of exogeneity cannot be rejected by a reasonable level of significance, T A B L E 4 Pooled IV probit estimator sanction, the causal relationship between ESG score and probability of a sanction can be explained through the need to re-build reputation after a penalty. In this case, the sanction (or the probability to be hit by a sanction, given that the market can possibly interpret publicly available signals as accounting items) induces a bank to a greater effort in order to get a higher ESG score.We get similar results with the IV model in terms of significance and sign of the ESG regressor.

        <p>It can be observed the z-bar tilde statistics rejects the null hypothesis of the probability of a sanction not to Granger-cause ESG scores with an extremely high statistical significance. The Z-bar statistics supports such a result, despite in short panels the former exhibits higher small-sample performances. Interestingly, the same test does not support the inverse causal relationship, that is, ESG Grangercausing the probability of a sanction, as shown in Table 6.It can be observed the z-bar tilde statistics rejects the null hypothesis of the probability of a sanction not to Granger-cause ESG scores with an extremely high statistical significance.

        <p>The econometric analysis of data, therefore, underpins the initial conjecture based on the covariation of aggregate ESG scores and number of sanctions in the recent years. In particular, when sanctions are inflicted many years later than the systemic shocks occurred during the financial crisis, they tend to signal bank-specific critical issues.The econometric analysis of data, therefore, underpins the initial conjecture based on the covariation of aggregate ESG scores and number of sanctions in the recent years.

        <p>Therefore, reputation building appears to be a plausible reason for the increase in the ESG overall score. In particular, a positive relationship between ESG and sanctions is documented at a bank-level. Nevertheless, despite the stability of the positive sign attached to ESG when penalties are the dependent variables, significance is low. One possible reason, along with the low number of observations, is that once the market recognizes that a bank is more likely to be sanctioned (or is actually sanctioned indeed), the bank itself tends to implement ESG-compliant strategies in order to recover from the implications of the bad signal. In fact, the estimated latent linear process determining the probability of a sanction is likely to cause (in accordance with Granger's definition of causality) the implementation of ESG strategies, with the purpose of reducing the stigma from potential or actual sanctions.Therefore, reputation building appears to be a plausible reason for the increase in the ESG overall score.

        <p>In Tables 7 and8 7 and8, it is apparent that ESG coefficients have a smaller magnitude than in the Thomson Reuters case and are almost generally not statistically significant. Moreover, their sign is not stable across specifications. Such differences with respect to the estimates obtained using Thomson Reuters scores can be related to the direct influence of sanctions and general regulatory issues included in the index. Once we instrument ESG by its past value, the coefficient turns steadily positive, despite not always significant, and with a relatively small magnitude. It should be remarked that the Wald tests (not reported) for exogeneity in two specifications out of three (namely those reported in columns ( 15) and ( 16) it Table 8 soundly reject the null hypotheses of exogeneity in the model, thus supporting the need for an adequate instrument in order to correctly assess the impact of ESG on the probability of sanctions.In Tables 7 and8 7 and8, it is apparent that ESG coefficients have a smaller magnitude than in the Thomson Reuters case and are almost generally not statistically significant.

        <p>The aim of our research was to analyse the impact of ESG score on banks' probability of sanction. Our choice is motivated by the commitment of international institutions and supervisory authorities to incentivize the phenomenon of sustainable finance (including the integration of ESG parameters) into all aspects of financial system. In this context, banks could play a crucial role in transferring financial resource toward social and environmental projects in order to contribute to sustainable and economic development. 2 The so-called "combined ESG score" by Thomson Reuters, instead, includes the rating on controversies and is not considered in our analyses.The aim of our research was to analyse the impact of ESG score on banks' probability of sanction.

        <p>In order to get a general idea of the phenomenon, aggregate ESG scores are provided as well. Aggregation occurred through simple averaging. In fact, all banks whose ESG score is available in our dataset can be thought of as "significant" in terms of systemic risk, which is a natural aggregation criterion for ESG because of its qualitative nature. Figures 2 and 3 show the dynamics of aggregate ESG scores from the two available sources. It can be observed that both of them show an increasing trend from 2015 on. A significant difference concerns the years from 2008 until 2011, where the Reuters score is rather stable, whereas the Bloomberg score (available from 2009) sharply decreases.In order to get a general idea of the phenomenon, aggregate ESG scores are provided as well.
