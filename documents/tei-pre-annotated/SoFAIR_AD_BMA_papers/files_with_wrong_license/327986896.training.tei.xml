        <p>Potential benefits have made remanufacturing attractive over the last decade. Nevertheless, the complexity and uncertainties associated with the process of managing returned products make remanufacturing challenging. Since this process involves enormous decision-making practices, various methods/techniques have been developed. This review is to specify the current challenges and opportunities for decision-making in remanufacturing. To achieve this, we perform a systematic review over decision-making in remanufacturing by classifying decisions into different managerial levels and areas. Adopting a systematic approach which provides a repeatable, transparent and scientific process, 241 key articles have been identified following a multi-stage review process. Our review indicates that most studies focuses on strategic-level (48%) and tactical-level (34%) with only 5% focusing on operational-level and the rest on two levels (13%). Regarding decision-making methods, most studies propose mathematical models (60%) followed by analytical models (31%). Furthermore, only 36% of the studies address uncertainties in which stochastic approach is mostly applied. A total of 21 knowledge gaps are highlighted to direct future research work.Potential benefits have made remanufacturing attractive over the last decade.

        <p>Remanufacturing is a process in which returned products (or cores/returns) are disassembled, all parts are inspected, repairable parts are fixed, the rest are replaced with new ones, and finally reassembled and tested to restore them into like-new condition (Thierry et al., 1995). It is the only recovery activity which provides the same quality, performance and warranty as the brand-new products (Ijomah, 2009). Remanufacturing has attracted widespread attention due to its potential benefits. Specifically, the economic benefits come from the cost savings (up to 50%) due to the reduction in energy (up to 60%) and material cost (up to 70%) (Jiang et al., 2016b). This cost advantage enables companies to offer remanufactured products at up to 40% lower prices than the new ones with nearly 20% profit margins (Ilgin &amp; Gupta, 2016).Remanufacturing is a process in which returned products (or cores/returns) are disassembled, all parts are inspected, repairable parts are fixed, the rest are replaced with new ones, and finally reassembled and tested to restore them into like-new condition (Thierry et al., 1995).

        <p>Compared with traditional manufacturing, remanufacturing is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainties associated with the process of managing returned products (Denizel et al., 2010;Guide, 2000;Inderfurth, 2005). Researchers have developed various decision-making methods as traditional ones may not be applicable to address the tangled characteristics of returned products. This research is urged due to a lack of a systematic review over decision-making in remanufacturing. The two most recent systematic reviews are Morgan &amp; Gagnon (2013) and Priyono et al. (2016). The former focuses on remanufacturing scheduling while the latter concentrates on disassembly in remanufacturing. However, a more comprehensive review of remanufacturing is needed beyond its scheduling and disassembly decisions. Ilgin &amp; Gupta (2010) examine environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery without considering remanufacturing. Goodall et al. (2014) review tools and techniques used to evaluate remanufacturing feasibility but do not specify at what managerial levels/areas these tools and techniques can be implemented. Souza (2008;2013) and Bostel et al. (2005) review the managerial decisions in closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) and reverse logistics (RL) network but they do not adopt a systematic approach, thus the finding reliability may be reduced (Tranfield et al., 2003).

In Stage 2, quality assessment was conducted following citation metrics and journal ranking (Crossan &amp; Apaydin, 2010). The former was used to evaluate studies dated before 2019 and the latter for studies dated 2019. Google citation metrics were used to assess studies pre-2019, and high-impact studies were defined as having at least five citations per year (Crossan &amp; Apaydin, 2010). "Highest CiteScore percentile" provided by Scopus was used to assess studies dated 2019 which may have low citation metrics. The title and summary of the studies were reviewed in Stage 3 for further screening.

        <p>Given the nature of managerial decisions in remanufacturing and their overall impact on businesses, it is useful to classify them into three levels: strategic, tactical and operational (Anthony, 1965;Schmidt &amp; Wilhelm, 2000). Decisions at each level were then grouped by various management areas as shown in Figure 2 following Bostel et al. (2005) and Souza (2008;2013) who performed the same classification to reverse logistics and CLSC decisions respectively.Given the nature of managerial decisions in remanufacturing and their overall impact on businesses, it is useful to classify them into three levels: strategic, tactical and operational (Anthony, 1965;Schmidt &amp; Wilhelm, 2000).

        <p>[Figure 2][Figure 2]</p>
        <p>Strategic-level decisions involve the determination and alteration of organisations' objectives (Anthony, 1965) which are made by the top management with long-lasting impact (2-5 years or beyond) (Schmidt &amp; Wilhelm, 2000). Such decisions are engagement in remanufacturing, product design, network design, supply chain (SC) coordination, collection strategy and marketing management.Strategic-level decisions involve the determination and alteration of organisations' objectives (Anthony, 1965) which are made by the top management with long-lasting impact (2-5 years or beyond) (Schmidt &amp; Wilhelm, 2000).

        <p>Given the benefits of remanufacturing and increasing environmental awareness, companies must consider their degree of involvement in remanufacturing practices. Research on engagement decisions in remanufacturing can be classified into four groups (Table 1): (i) critical drivers of original equipment manufacturers' (OEMs') decisions towards in-house remanufacturing; (ii) barriers towards remanufacturing in developing countries; and (iii) economic viability and technical feasibility of remanufacturing; and (iv) optimal timing of implementing in-house remanufacturing.Given the benefits of remanufacturing and increasing environmental awareness, companies must consider their degree of involvement in remanufacturing practices.

        <p>Our review suggests that both key drivers towards in-house remanufacturing and barriers towards remanufacturing vary among different countries and industries. For instance, technical concerns are the principal drivers for Chinese automotive parts companies (Abdulrahman et al., 2015) while drivers for American OEMs are operational assets, intellectual property and frequency (Martin et al., 2010). For automotive parts remanufacturing, the barrier is lack of fund for remanufacturing technology in China (Xia et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2014) while it is the higher cost and lack of specific market for remanufactured products in India (Govindan et al., 2016). Table 1 reveals that automotive sector has attracted most attention because it is: (i) one of the earliest industries engaged in remanufacturing (Seitz, 2007), (ii) the leading industry involving most of the remanufacturing companies and remanufactured components (Abdulrahman et al., 2015), and (iii) governed by the regulatory directives on the collection and processing of end-of-life (EOL) vehicles (Karakayali et al., 2007).Our review suggests that both key drivers towards in-house remanufacturing and barriers towards remanufacturing vary among different countries and industries.

        <p>[Table 1][Table 1]</p>
        <p>One of the barriers to remanufacturing is improper product design (Govindan et al., 2016) which affects the remanufacturing profitability (Kwak &amp; Kim, 2015;Wu, 2012b;2013).One of the barriers to remanufacturing is improper product design (Govindan et al., 2016) which affects the remanufacturing profitability (Kwak &amp; Kim, 2015;Wu, 2012b;2013).</p>
        <p>OEMs' product design decisions must consider both the pre-life and end-of-life stages of the product to maximise overall profit along the whole product life-cycle (Kwak &amp; Kim, 2015;Ma et al., 2014) and enhance the product remanufacturability (Yang et al., 2017). Nevertheless, OEMs may intend to prevent competition by increasing the remanufacturing cost for thirdparty remanufacturers (Subramanian et al., 2013;Wu, 2012b;2013).OEMs' product design decisions must consider both the pre-life and end-of-life stages of the product to maximise overall profit along the whole product life-cycle (Kwak &amp; Kim, 2015;Ma et al., 2014) and enhance the product remanufacturability (Yang et al., 2017).

        <p>Product design decisions are classified into four focuses (Table 2): (i) sustainable product design, (ii) product life-cycle approach of optimising product designs, (iii) component recovery options, and (iv) design for disassembly to reduce remanufacturing cost. Table 2 shows that the interest in product design from remanufacturing perspective has increased especially from its life-cycle aspects. From a methodological standpoint, three model types are noted: (i) conceptual and descriptive models mainly in the form of guidelines and roadmaps for sustainable product design studies, (ii) mathematical and analytical models for component and disassembly-based studies, and (iii) systematic models for studies with life-cycle perspective.Product design decisions are classified into four focuses (Table 2): (i) sustainable product design, (ii) product life-cycle approach of optimising product designs, (iii) component recovery options, and (iv) design for disassembly to reduce remanufacturing cost.

        <p>Designing an efficient SC network is crucial to meet demand considering the reciprocal flows between customers and manufacturers (Souza, 2013). Determining the locations and capacities of facilities, optimal transportation mode and distribution channel, are the primary network design decisions. Other studies are found to investigate joint location-inventory problems (Abdallah et al., 2012;Lieckens et al., 2013) and integrated SC design and planning problems (Mota et al., 2017).Designing an efficient SC network is crucial to meet demand considering the reciprocal flows between customers and manufacturers (Souza, 2013).

        <p>Network design models can be divided into two groups: (i) stochastic models addressing different types of real-world uncertainties, and (ii) deterministic models neglecting uncertainties. Table 3 shows that 61% of the models are deterministic for the sake of computational simplicity. However, ignoring uncertainties when designing network may be impractical or risky as it can endanger the business survival. On the contrary, the most addressed uncertainty among stochastic models is the demand for remanufactured products while the returns quality which helps determine the number of recoverable products is considered by very few studies. Regarding model objectives, most studies emphasise economic aspects, e.g. maximising the company profit (50%) or minimising the total system cost (32%), only a few studies have incorporated environmental and social aspects. Moreover, most models (86%) are single-objective.Network design models can be divided into two groups: (i) stochastic models addressing different types of real-world uncertainties, and (ii) deterministic models neglecting uncertainties.

        <p>SC coordination studies are divided into four focuses (Table 4). The first group investigates the impact of demand information sharing on the pricing and SC profit. The second group examines the use of contracts through correlating service level with pricing to increase SC profit. The third group addresses the trade-offs between pricing and remanufacturing effort when maximising SC profit. The final group examines the impact of different channel power structures (e.g., centralised; manufacturer-, retailer-, third-party-led decentralised; and Vertical Nash) on pricing and collection effort. Table 4 shows that game theory modelling is the most popular method (92%) to resolve conflicts in SC coordination (An et al., 2007). Other methods are equilibrium and benchmark models. Regarding model objectives, most studies (96%) consider profit maximisation. Maximisation of collection efficiency and market share have received limited attention while minimisation of environmental impact has not been examined yet. It reinforces that financial incentives are still the main drivers to SC coordination.SC coordination studies are divided into four focuses (Table 4).

        <p>Remanufacturers need to minimise the overall collection effort while keeping sufficient quantity of cores for meeting the remanufacturing demand. The choice of collection channels by comparing single and dual channels have been mostly investigated.Remanufacturers need to minimise the overall collection effort while keeping sufficient quantity of cores for meeting the remanufacturing demand.

        <p>The first stream addresses three single channels: (i) Re/manufacturer directly collects from customers (model M); (ii) Re/manufacturer persuades the retailer to collect from customers (model R); (iii) Re/manufacturer authorises the third-party to collect from customers (model 3P). The second stream examines dual channels involving two parties simultaneously:The first stream addresses three single channels: (i) Re/manufacturer directly collects from customers (model M); (ii) Re/manufacturer persuades the retailer to collect from customers (model R); (iii) Re/manufacturer authorises the third-party to collect from customers (model 3P).

        <p>Our review uncovers two major observations: (i) Dual channel is superior to single channel because collective effort can increase SC profit with higher collection rates and economies of scale (Hong et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2013;Yi et al., 2016), and (ii) Model R is the optimal collection channel for remanufacturer due to cost savings associated with collection investment (Hong et al., 2015;Savaskan et al., 2004;Savaskan &amp; Van Wassenhove, 2006).Our review uncovers two major observations: (i) Dual channel is superior to single channel because collective effort can increase SC profit with higher collection rates and economies of scale (Hong et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2013;Yi et al., 2016), and (ii) Model R is the optimal collection channel for remanufacturer due to cost savings associated with collection investment (Hong et al., 2015;Savaskan et al., 2004;Savaskan &amp; Van Wassenhove, 2006).</p>
        <p>Regardless of the channel structure (single or dual), the retailer's involvement is critical to optimise remanufacturer's collection effort (Zhao et al., 2017a). Table 5 shows that, apart from Esmaeili et al. (2016) who consider green costs, many studies examine collection effort by considering one or more of the following: wholesale price, retailer price, product return rate and transfer price.Regardless of the channel structure (single or dual), the retailer's involvement is critical to optimise remanufacturer's collection effort (Zhao et al., 2017a).

        <p>Various assumptions have been made in these studies which may reduce their real-life impact: (i) 81% of the studies assume that all SC members may share sensitive information such as cost, demand and return which shapes the competition, (ii) 63% of the studies assume deterministic demand for remanufactured products which can be formulated as a linear function of its retail price. However, such demand can be non-linear and sensitive to other factors such as marketing effort, customers' willingness-to-pay, etc. (Esmaeili et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2017), (iii) 75% of the studies assume that the quality of the returned products is homogeneous, i.e. each has the same remanufacturing cost which enables researchers to compare only the quantity of used products from different channels (Karakayali et al., 2007). Such comparison may not be meaningful as the quality of returned products varies significantly in real practice (Denizel et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2017a), and (iv) 69% of the studies assume new and remanufactured products of the same category can be sold in the same market at the same price.Various assumptions have been made in these studies which may reduce their real-life impact: (i) 81% of the studies assume that all SC members may share sensitive information such as cost, demand and return which shapes the competition, (ii) 63% of the studies assume deterministic demand for remanufactured products which can be formulated as a linear function of its retail price.

        <p>This assumption is valid for only specific categories such as single-use cameras and toner cartridges (Atasu et al., 2013;Liu et al., 2017). For other categories, new products are differentiated from the remanufactured ones which are generally perceived by customers as inferior, thus lower willingness-to-pay (Atasu et al., 2010).This assumption is valid for only specific categories such as single-use cameras and toner cartridges (Atasu et al., 2013;Liu et al., 2017).

        <p>OEMs' pricing strategies for new and remanufactured products have been examined from different perspectives. Some considers measuring consumers' willingness-to-switch to remanufactured products (Ovchinnikov, 2011); others examine trade-in related decisions (e.g., Xiao (2017)) and leasing duration (Robotis et al., 2012) for customers who want to replace their old products with new/remanufactured products. Some argue that OEMs can influence the pricing strategy of third-party remanufacturers in two ways: (i) Control the degree of disassemblability and interchangeability of OEMs' own products that affect the remanufacturing cost (Wu, 2012b;2013) and (ii) Prevent market cannibalisation by collecting their products from end users with incentives (Wu, 2015). Another stream argues that pricing for remanufactured products are interrelated with acquisition price of cores to balance the demand for remanufactured products and returns quantity (e.g., Bakal &amp; Akcali (2006)). It is worth noting that issues with market cannibalisation have been mostly examined while other forms of competition have been overlooked.OEMs' pricing strategies for new and remanufactured products have been examined from different perspectives.

        <p>Specifically, Govindan et al. (2017) have classified three approaches of addressing uncertainties as stochastic, fuzzy and robust. In stochastic case, probability distributions of uncertain (random) parameters are assumed to be known or estimated from historical data. In fuzzy case, random parameters are assumed to be fuzzy numbers which are normalised from fuzzy sets through membership functions (Demirli &amp; Yimer, 2008). In robust case, it is not necessary to know the probability distributions of random parameters, but the value intervals of the uncertain parameters (Govindan et al., 2017). The most commonly used approach to address uncertainties in remanufacturing is stochastic (84 studies) followed by fuzzy (6) and robust (1). This result suggests that uncertainties in remanufacturing decision-making are mostly modelled using stochastical approach. However, the choice of probability distributions is often selected for the ease of model simplicity and computation. This may create a gap between the model and the reality. Hence, fuzzy and robust approaches have been explored to close this gap.Specifically, Govindan et al.

        <p>A comprehensive investigation of decision-making in remanufacturing is presented to address three research questions by systematically reviewing 241 papers. Decision-making practices are first classified into strategic-, tactical-and operational-level decisions. Decisions, under each level, are then examined in different management areas to address RQ1.

        <p>As discussed in Section 2.3, operational-level decisions are vital to maximise remanufacturing outcomes while supporting strategic-and tactical-level decisions. Process planning, as one of the operational-level decisions, is challenging subject to uncertainty and availability of shop floor resources. These challenges diminish the effectiveness of a process plan during the scheduling phase (Lian et al., 2012). In manufacturing systems, integration of process planning and shop floor scheduling have been proven effective. Unlike conventional manufacturing, both processing route and time of returned products are uncertain in remanufacturing systems due to uncertain returns quality (Guide, 2000). Hence, existing approaches of integrating process planning and shop floor scheduling would be less effective and efficient. Therefore, an integrated approach considering the inherent uncertain characteristics of returned products is one of the important gaps. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to capture full usage pattern of returned products, hence, such uncertainties would be addressed by robust optimisation in case of limited historical data. Hence, one line of our future work will be developing a robust optimisation model for integrating process planning and scheduling with an aim to maximise the remanufacturing outcomes.As discussed in Section 2.3, operational-level decisions are vital to maximise remanufacturing outcomes while supporting strategic-and tactical-level decisions.

        <p>Although our review is comprehensive, there are some limitations. Firstly, this study might not cover all research work of decision-making in remanufacturing due to the use of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Secondly, some research gaps might be less industry-relevant as academic papers were mainly reviewed. Thirdly, the main findings of this study were derived from authors' analysis which might involve a certain degree of subjectivity. However, since a systematic approach was adopted, such subjectivity might be insignificant as compared to traditional literature review.Although our review is comprehensive, there are some limitations.
