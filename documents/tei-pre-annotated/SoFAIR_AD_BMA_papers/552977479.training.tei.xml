        <p>The main research question of the study is this: Is the firm embedded into ecology, society, and governance (ESG), or vice versa? Using the resource-based view as a theoretical lens, and stakeholder capitalism as a paradigm anchored in the Dashgupat Review, we demonstrate in a panel data over 26 years that at the firm level, the relationship between sustained competitive advantage and the ESG footprint is concave shaped, and the impact inequality multiple gaps of the ESG footprint are 4.75 times the providing capacity of the natural and business environment. To solve the common method variance, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity, system GMM is used as a method in a dataset of US manufacturing firms from 1992 to 2019. At the end, we argue that extant attributes of a resource base for sustained competitive advantage have an inherent flaw anchored in the resource-based view, as they ignore the "environmental, social, and governance (ESG) friendliness" attribute of a resource. Managers need to rethink the objective of their firms if they want to survive in the new ESG-friendly economy with stakeholder supremacy.The main research question of the study is this: Is the firm embedded into ecology, society, and governance (ESG), or vice versa?

        <p>ministries of finance and economy need to lead the way to enable the wider society to conduct proper decision-making with new success metrics, by reflecting on the premise that "humanity and global economy are embedded within nature, not vice versa." This is an alarming state of affairs if we want to have sustainable development and meet the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Guia Arraiano et al., 2017;Liute &amp; De Giacomo, 2021;Orazalin &amp; Mahmood, 2021).ministries of finance and economy need to lead the way to enable the wider society to conduct proper decision-making with new success metrics, by reflecting on the premise that "humanity and global economy are embedded within nature, not vice versa."

        <p>Humanity must be aware of reducing its demands on environmental, social, and governance-related (ESG) footprints and help sustain its supply capacity. All four Ps (politicians, plural sector, private sector, and public sector) must have a strong commitment to conservation and the restoration of ecosystems with a notion to drive a sustainable ecological footprint at individual and household levels. While Dasgupta (2021) provides a macroperspective of ecology, we delve into social and governance-related impact separate from the ecological impact at the firm level; out of the four Ps, our current study poses two research questions focused on the private sector: (1) What level of ecological, social, and governance footprint has the US manufacturing sector incurred while reaping good profitable growth? (2) Is the firm embedded into environment, sociology, and ecology, or vice versa? Daft (1983) defined firms' resources based on the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness. Any "assets, capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc." that serve the lofty goal of efficiency and effectiveness of the firm are called resources. Barney (1991) argued that not all physical capital, human capital, and organizational capital are important resources that serve the strategic purpose, and suggested the VRIN-O attributes of resources as the differentiating mechanism for sustained competitive advantage.Humanity must be aware of reducing its demands on environmental, social, and governance-related (ESG) footprints and help sustain its supply capacity.

        <p>Achieving a competitive advantage is a strategic approach that is being pursued in parallel by all competitors. Thus, the focus of the study is not on the structural or environmental changes, such as technology changes or creative destruction (Schumpeter, 1942), which may make current resources redundant or not important, and competitive advantage may be over. However, when a firm has a sustained competitive advantage, the strategic approach is to create value that is unique to that firm only, where imitation of the same is not possible (Barney, 1991;Barney et al., 2021;Bhandari et al., 2020). The focus of our study, thus, is on the firm's VRIN-O attributes and how this can create sustained competitive advantage.Achieving a competitive advantage is a strategic approach that is being pursued in parallel by all competitors.

        <p>Based on the assumption that resources are heterogeneous and immobile at the same time, this study follows VRIN-O attributes which are history-dependent, causally ambiguous, and socially complex-embedded into the idiosyncrasy of the firm. To achieve the lofty goal of sustained competitive advantage, the majority of firms have profit maximization as their objective at the cost of ESG degradation (Freeman et al., 2021). The firm's sustainability and ESG literature at firm level has been confronted by Porter and Kramer (2019) through the "shared value" concept. However, attempts to measure the "shared value" have not been very successful, even after Porter et al.'s (2011) contribution in this direction. Extant research applied survey data or archival proxies in strategic management in general terms, while the latter is predominant in highly cited contributions. However, according to Ketchen et al. (2013) such studies are "castles made of sand." Responding to the call, to avoid building these "castles made of sand," we use computer-aided text analysis (CATA) and a machine learning technique called natural language processing (NLP) to build our measure of ecological footprint, our outcome, or criterion variable. To mitigate the reliability, validity, and generalizability of extant measures, a rigorous methodological approach is taken.Based on the assumption that resources are heterogeneous and immobile at the same time, this study follows VRIN-O attributes which are history-dependent, causally ambiguous, and socially complex-embedded into the idiosyncrasy of the firm.

        <p>In a panel dataset of the US manufacturing sector between 1992 and 2019, panel regression using system GMM which handles common method variance, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity (CEU) shows that as a firm's profit rises over time, the ESG footprint has a concave-shaped relationship. This finding has major implications for both theory and practice. First, the current VRIN-O attributes of the firm's strategic resources are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the much-required new objective of the firm-together with profit, a firm needs to respect social development, ecological justice, and governance compliance. Thus, in the end, a refined version of the (ESG) resource-based view (ESG-RBV) has been proposed following the research call from Barney (2018) and Barney et al. (2021). Second, post-estimation analysis shows that the US manufacturing sector is overusing the ESG by 4.75 times the level it can serve and regenerate for sustainable development, as envisioned by the UN's sustainable development regime (SDG-R). Second, based on the overuse of 4.75 times the providing capacity of the ecological systems, the United States is on the verge of being at melting point. Thus, as suggested by Dasgupta (2021), policymakers, conscious CEOs, managers, the plural sector, and ecological activist must act urgently before it's too late and the regenerative capacity of the ESG becomes impossible to recover.In a panel dataset of the US manufacturing sector between 1992 and 2019, panel regression using system GMM which handles common method variance, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity (CEU) shows that as a firm's profit rises over time, the ESG footprint has a concave-shaped relationship.

        <p>Next, we explain the CATA with the NLP approach, and its value in assessing the ecological footprint through the large corpus of unstructured texts in the firms' annual reports filed in the US Securities and Exchange Commission. For the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the measure, we introduce human judgment as a triangulation. Further, using system GMM, we use panel regression to assess the impact of sustained competitive advantage on the text-based ecological footprint. In the end, we discuss major implications for the RBV, and strategic management at large, to further the use of NLP and CATA-based techniques.Next, we explain the CATA with the NLP approach, and its value in assessing the ecological footprint through the large corpus of unstructured texts in the firms' annual reports filed in the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

        <p>The Barnean and Freemanian schools of thought on stakeholder capitalism seek to achieve at the firm level that any human activity that leaves more ecological damage than nature can provide while regenerating itself is used as an ecological footprint (Dasgupta, 2021;Pascual et al., 2021). Following this definition, and based on the extant literature on the environment, social, and governance (ESG) aspects of the firm, which is driven by the stakeholder capitalism doctrine, the current study assesses the ecological footprint as "1-ESG."The Barnean and Freemanian schools of thought on stakeholder capitalism seek to achieve at the firm level that any human activity that leaves more ecological damage than nature can provide while regenerating itself is used as an ecological footprint (Dasgupta, 2021;Pascual et al., 2021).

        <p>The traditional objective of the firm was profit maximization-with ruthless short-term execution, quarterly share price, and related performance reward mechanisms for the CEOs and the top management alike. In the pursuit of excellence in profit maximization, it has now finally been realized that we are seeing the major symptoms of the ecological sickness that the planet is facing. Of course, the inequality regime (Piketty, 2021) has emerged due to the accumulation of the majority of the wealth in the Top 1 percentile of the population. While too much orientation towards public sector-driven economy resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union and allied countries, similar symptoms of too much liberalization and the free market economy without the proper control of the public sector have paralyzed the earth-and increased inequality in all aspects, including the impact inequality as suggested by Dasgupta (2021).The traditional objective of the firm was profit maximization-with ruthless short-term execution, quarterly share price, and related performance reward mechanisms for the CEOs and the top management alike.

        <p>While the extant understanding of how can we even put a price tag on nature is equally valid, unless and until, we have objective measures of the ESG, we will not know what level of effort is needed to safeguard against irreversible damage to the biodiversity. Similarly, the impact on a society with a proper ethical governance mechanism must be assessed, and this assessment must drive the objective of the firm, rather than the orthodox measure of a single unit of profit maximization.While the extant understanding of how can we even put a price tag on nature is equally valid, unless and until, we have objective measures of the ESG, we will not know what level of effort is needed to safeguard against irreversible damage to the biodiversity.

        <p>Our approach is an improved construct and measurement purpose, based on the preliminary attempts done by Porter et al. (2011) with a shared focus, sustainability, impact assessment, reputation, and compliance approach, to create and measure shared value and similar literature streams. As shown in the last row of Table A1, our focus is on the ecological footprint in contrast to extant measures for similar constructs. Porter and Kramer (2019) argued for the shared value creation, measurement, and validation which furthered the stream of research related to ESG. When the shared value concept is used, it is understood that the firm is having economic, societal, and environmental benefits as its objective. However, this approach suffers from the neglect of governance and compliance.Our approach is an improved construct and measurement purpose, based on the preliminary attempts done by Porter et al.

        <p>While compliance (Birnbaum, 2016) became another small stream of research, a connected and valid approach similar to ESG has not existed for long. Arguments for a firm sustainability approach (Delai &amp; Takahashi, 2011), an impact assessment approach (Social Impact Assessment, 1995), and a reputation approach (Hall &amp; Lee, 2014) have been used as a lens to understand the new objective of the firm anchored in stakeholder capitalism. To cover the governance gap, and not to leave other smaller streams of research in societal and environmental approaches, current research assesses the ESG friendliness of a firm through a CATA-based novel measurement approach.While compliance (Birnbaum, 2016) became another small stream of research, a connected and valid approach similar to ESG has not existed for long.

        <p>While the extant research used secondary data and the index created by CSR initiatives, we built a comprehensive measure based on the annual report discourses. The brief comparison of all of these streams of research is tabulated in Table A1, with a clear contrast in its presentation. The first part is our unique approach, while the second part shows that the subsequent assessment methods have their own approaches and objectives. Porter et al. (2011) have a detailed discussion of these approaches, but our synthesis does not exclude the extant research in this area.While the extant research used secondary data and the index created by CSR initiatives, we built a comprehensive measure based on the annual report discourses.

        <p>In all extant constructs and measures, the assumption is that ecology and sociology are embedded into business and economics. However, we have proposed to reverse this assumption with an idea that the environmental, social, and governance impact assessment and protection is the main objective of the firm, and the firm is embedded into the sociology and ecology of the biosphere. We would like to emphasize that our measurement assesses the net ecological impact so that the firm can assess the providing or regenerative capacity of the ESG. This assessment is then helpful for managers, policymakers, and researchers, alike.In all extant constructs and measures, the assumption is that ecology and sociology are embedded into business and economics.

        <p>The unique advantage that cannot be duplicated by competitors is called sustained competitive advantage (Bhandari et al., 2020;Barney, 1991). This is possible if a firm has VRIN-O resource attributes when focusing on the internal strengths and weaknesses to achieve efficiency and effectiveness. The success of the RBV since 1991 triggered an assessment of the contribution to strategic management from this stream of literature (Barney et al., 2021) which argues that there are three avenues for further research-creating synergy effect across theories, a focused approach on the RBV itself, and developing the strategic resource concept further.The unique advantage that cannot be duplicated by competitors is called sustained competitive advantage (Bhandari et al., 2020;Barney, 1991).

        <p>Not only the originator Barney himself, but Freeman et al. (2021) also urged researchers to merge stakeholder theory and the resourcebased view in their research. Despite its popularity, the RBV seems yet incomplete, while there is room for bringing sustainability, people, cooperation, and normativity at the same time. Academy of Management Conference has initiated a symposium in building a formal modeling approach to the RBV, pointing out the need for formal models that are reasonably better, and will have a remedial response to the criticisms that the RBV is predominantly verbal in nature, which attracted further criticism of its formal structure (Boysen et al., 2020). As rightly demanded by stakeholder theory and the formal modeling approach, the proponents of the business ecosystem are arguing that a new approach is needed to understanding the antecedents of the value of the resource and capability. Thus, RBV must be strengthened from the business ecosystem perspective where interorganizational cooperation becomes very important (Gueler &amp; Schneider, 2021). These demand an understanding not only of the business ecosystem but also the natural ecosystem, as the firm is being provided with every resource it needs by the biosphere, but almost without a price tag.Not only the originator Barney himself, but Freeman et al.

        <p>While the RBV's originator and Freeman et al. are calling for the revival of the research agenda, the looming crisis of biodiversity degradation (Dasgupta, 2021) raises concerns not only at the macrolevel but at the firm level as well. Profit maximization as the objective of the firm (Friedman, 1970) puts the planet in this situation. Therefore, the current level of providing and regenerative capacity of the ecology at the macrolevel has been exceeded by 1.6 times. This demands further assessment of the ecological footprint at the firm level.While the RBV's originator and Freeman et al. are calling for the revival of the research agenda, the looming crisis of biodiversity degradation (Dasgupta, 2021) raises concerns not only at the macrolevel but at the firm level as well.

        <p>The argument posed by Dasgupta (2021) has generated enough debate in both aisles of economic thought.

        <p>The current study takes this granular approach to the US manufacturing firms and argues that their ecological footprint is above the limit the ecology can provide for. Assessment of the same for theoretical and practical implications is still needed, and the current study joins in with this new emerging literature at the firm level.The current study takes this granular approach to the US manufacturing firms and argues that their ecological footprint is above the limit the ecology can provide for.

        <p>In a sustainable world, the ratio between sustained competitive advantage and the providing capacity of the ESG or biodiversity must not cross "1." This implies that all the profit growth the firms are reaping must be thought through from the ecological perspectives with the 4Ps in mind-people, planet, profit, and the plural sector. If the 4Psbased objective of the firm is pursued, the ratio between sustained competitive advantage and ecological footprint will be 1, in the equilibrium condition. Until then, the biosphere and biodiversity keep the regeneration capacity intact. Beyond that, it will have alarming effects, as seen in climate change, droughts, floods, degradation of flora and fauna, and the mass extinction of species (Dasgupta, 2021). However, the current study expects that the ratio between sustained competitive advantage and the firm's ecological footprint is way high, mitigating the same is a must, and this relationship is concave, not linear. Marx's transformation of production value into production price perspective, and the sustained competitive advantage of the firm based on the VRIN-O attributes of strategic resources with idiosyncratic resource endowment and deployment, suffer from not accounting for the market factors (Dassler, 2020). While this is a problematic issue in the RBV, looking from the demand and supply perspective of biodiversity is still under-researched at the firm level.In a sustainable world, the ratio between sustained competitive advantage and the providing capacity of the ESG or biodiversity must not cross "1."

        <p>The limits to growth suggested by Dasgupta (2021) provide a strong basis for our theorizing and hypothesizing that when profit keeps on growing, its ecological footprint takes a concave shapesuggesting that if the objective of the firm is to maximize only profit, the cost in terms of social degradation and ecological failure is increasing rapidly. The reasons for such a phenomenon are obvious, as the providing capacity of the biosphere and resource base of the planet is in danger if we focus only on profit maximization. While Friedman's doctrine argued that the only corporate social responsibility of the firm is to maximize profit, this notion leads firms to ignore the social and ecological degradation they are causing.The limits to growth suggested by Dasgupta (2021) provide a strong basis for our theorizing and hypothesizing that when profit keeps on growing, its ecological footprint takes a concave shapesuggesting that if the objective of the firm is to maximize only profit, the cost in terms of social degradation and ecological failure is increasing rapidly.

        <p>While pricing the priceless argument plagues the assessment of the resource endowment of nature, it is important to measure the natural capital (Dasgupta, 2021;Polasky &amp; Daily, 2021) to understand the gaps and devise an instrument to tackle the degradation of the same, so that environmental justice at the local and global level is possible (Martínez-Alier, 1997). Thus, the emergence of a new paradigm around ESG and its related footprint argues that the objective of the firm needs to be modified. So far, profit has been the outcome variable, suggesting that ecology and society are embedded into the firm. Thus, we reiterate the reversal of the equation and suggest that the firm is embedded in the ecology and society at large, and we must use an ecological-sociological footprint as an outcome variable. Thus, the current study argues that at the firm level, sustained competitive advantage and the ecological footprint have a concave-shaped relationship.While pricing the priceless argument plagues the assessment of the resource endowment of nature, it is important to measure the natural capital (Dasgupta, 2021;Polasky &amp; Daily, 2021) to understand the gaps and devise an instrument to tackle the degradation of the same, so that environmental justice at the local and global level is possible (Martínez-Alier, 1997).

        <p>For this study, we collected data from 1992 to 2019, 27 years altogether. Data for hypothesis testing were collected using the following steps. First, most yearly filings for companies with a SIC code between 3500 and 3600 were obtained from the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) database (www.sec.gov), giving us 1208 companies and 37,690 filings. Next, 10-K405 and 10-KSB filings were removed from the data, as these are filed by very small companies not included in our analysis. This decreased the number of companies to 930 and the number of filings to 6148. Next, the financial data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon service and connected to the annual reports. The connection was made using a multistep verification procedure. The Thomson Reuters database does not recognize the CIK code the SEC uses for company identification. Thus, we used the Python programming language (Van Rossum, 1995) to transform the CIK code to the ticker symbol for each company, which was then connected to the financial data. In this verification procedure, we used the SEC database, the Thomson Reuters Database, and the PermID service (www.permid.org) offered by Thomson Reuters. This process allowed us to reliably connect the annual reports and the financial data for 571 companies and 6088 10-K filings.For this study, we collected data from 1992 to 2019, 27 years altogether.

        <p>For example, in the vector space of a GloVe model, semantically similar words are close. Thus, the GloVe vector space has exactly the structure we needed in our application. We calculated the Euclidean distance of words in the GloVe vector space and selected words whose distance from the manually chosen keywords was smallest to search for similar words. We used the

Specifically, we implemented the GloVe 300-dimensional word vector model in our application. It is trained using the Wikipedia 2014 dump, which includes all the articles on Wikipedia in 2014, and the Gigaword 5 corpus, a comprehensive archive of newswire text data.

        <p>For every measurement technique, reliability and validity are of utmost importance. If the reliability and validity cannot be established, the linkage between the construct and the measures is broken. To avoid this pitfall, we did manual coding for 15 randomly selected companies (Uotila et al., 2009). The definition of ESG was given to the coders rather than the keywords used in the CATA analysis. The inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960) of the classification, with two coders resulted at 0.62. The correlation between CATA-based measurement and manual coding was 0.54. Thus, CATA and manual coding can be inferred to have similar indication and reliability, and validity with the CATA model. As suggested by Krippendorff (1980, p. 122) a keyword in context (KWIC) analysis was conducted to improve the CATA measures and their validity. Spurious words were blocked from the analysis.For every measurement technique, reliability and validity are of utmost importance.

        <p>The novelty of the GMM lies in its capacity to handle common method variance (CMV), endogeneity (E), and unobserved heterogeneity (U), the CEU problem (Bhandari et al., 2020). First, to tackle CMV, the independent and dependent variables were measured from different sources combined with the lagging of the independent variable by 1 year; this year's impact of the independent variable is realized only the following year. Second, endogeneity was handled through the lagged values of predetermined variables and year dummies as instruments. Third, to cater to the unobserved heterogeneity, a lagged-dependent variable (ecological footprint per employee) was used as a control in the system generalized method of moments (GMM) and the specification (Wooldridge, 2009).

        <p>A summary of the construct means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values, and correlations matrix is shown in the Table A2. Winsorization at 1% level for all continuous variables was used. The ecological footprint per employee has a mean value of 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.64. Similarly, another key variable of interest is profit per employee with a mean value of 1.42 and standard deviation of 0.37. Explorative innovation and exploitative innovation have a mean value of 0.18 and 1.99, respectively, and standard deviation of 0.13 and 1.27. Apart from these important data, the minimum and maximum range of each variables is reported in Table A2. Similarly, the correlation table shows reasonably low correlations.

During the early stage of profitmaking, it seems that the firm's ESG footprint is low, but as and when the profit performance goes higher and higher, the ESG footprint skyrockets. This demands a proper reflection of the firm's underlying assumptions behind the resource attributes, and the traditional assumption that ecology and society are embedded into the firm must be reversed-that is, the firm is embedded into society and ecology. With high respect to Adam Smith, the father of economics, we beg to differ on this notion of a deliberate, self-interest, maximization approach by a firm, as demonstrated by our findings that the narrow self-interest of a firm degenerated the ecological and social fabrics alike. Extant research argues that the VRIN-O attributes of a resource give a firm a sustainable 2 competitive advantage.

The goods and service providing capacity of the biodiversity in the US manufacturing sector is already suffering 4.75 times the overload, which will trigger many changes in biodiversity and biosphere alike.While Dasgupta (2021) provided macrolevel analysis, our study focused at the firm level, and in one country, but is of the highest importance from the ecological footprint-related issues.

        <p>Thus, the private sector can take the lead role in recognizing this as a major crisis in biodiversity, and reorient the objective function of the firm from a traditional profit-only perspective to one which involves the new "profit, societal impact, and ecological impact." In the latter approach, "the firm is embedded in the biodiversity or ESG," not vice versa, as assumed by the traditional RBV.Thus, the private sector can take the lead role in recognizing this as a major crisis in biodiversity, and reorient the objective function of the firm from a traditional profit-only perspective to one which involves the new "profit, societal impact, and ecological impact."

        <p>In this study, we examined the relationship between sustained competitive advantage and ecological footprint using computer-aided text analysis (CATA) and a machine learning technique called natural language processing (NLP). We developed a new measure of ecological footprint at the firm level by leveraging a widely used CATA and NLP technique to unstructured text from annual reports of the US manufacturing sector from 1992 to 2019. To validate the measure created by us, we followed a novel method to utilize human interpretation of CATA-based outputs. For better causal insights by handling common method variance, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity (CEU), we demonstrated how this new measure is related with a sustained competitive advantage from the resource-based view lens.In this study, we examined the relationship between sustained competitive advantage and ecological footprint using computer-aided text analysis (CATA) and a machine learning technique called natural language processing (NLP).

        <p>A refined (ecological) resource-based view (eco-RBV) is proposed as a theoretical contribution, while the new approach to measuring ecological footprint is our empirical and methodological contribution.A refined (ecological) resource-based view (eco-RBV) is proposed as a theoretical contribution, while the new approach to measuring ecological footprint is our empirical and methodological contribution.</p>
        <p>Social science has adapted machine learning, NLP, and CATA successfully, and a recent contribution in Strategic Management Journal (Choi et al., 2021) suggests that the modern methods are better predictors with accuracy and efficiency. While topic modeling is also gaining ground, CATA has been established since 2009 (Uotila et al., 2009) in strategic management discourse. The predominant research method in social science surveys and suffers from common method variance problems. Similarly, cross-sectional studies are normally pursued due to retrospective bias and role changes in the firm over time. However, with the CATA model, we can run longitudinal analysis which helps in avoiding unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity. Analytical methods like system GMM handle these methodological black holes in its specification itself, with a lagged-dependent variable as control and use of instruments in the GMM function. Thus, the future of CATA and NLP-based measurement models seems promising.Social science has adapted machine learning, NLP, and CATA successfully, and a recent contribution in Strategic Management Journal (Choi et al., 2021) suggests that the modern methods are better predictors with accuracy and efficiency.

        <p>The findings have major implications for sustainable economic growth that helps managers to make a conscious choice in defining the attributes of the resources in use. If a firm's resource attributes do not include "eco-friendliness," that resource is of no value for the firm.The findings have major implications for sustainable economic growth that helps managers to make a conscious choice in defining the attributes of the resources in use.

        <p>While we are reviewing the current trend in ecological, social, and governance-related policy changes, BBC (2021) broadcasts headline news on major climate change-related policy changes by the EU for the whole bloc, with an audacious goal of reaching carbon neutral status by 2050. Based on the 4.75 multiple of overuse of the ecological, social, and governance footprint, achieving this goal within the timeframe needs sweeping changes in R&amp;D, innovation, competition, and financial and economic instruments and investments. While Dasgupta (2021) argued for efficient use of technology and innovation to serve this transformation, we are yet hesitant to quantify and assess the same at the firm level, as development of the measurement instrument and its validation is further due.While we are reviewing the current trend in ecological, social, and governance-related policy changes, BBC (2021) broadcasts headline news on major climate change-related policy changes by the EU for the whole bloc, with an audacious goal of reaching carbon neutral status by 2050.

        <p>Using the resource-based view as the theoretical lens, we argued that VRIN-O attributes of a resource base have an inherent flaw, as they ignore "eco-friendliness." For this, we proposed the revised RBV framework where eco-friendliness becomes one of the major attributes of a resource base. Following the Dasgupta (2021) approach at the firm level, we were able to assess this gap to be in the range of 4.75. Similarly, the sustained competitive advantage has a concave-shaped relationship with the ecological footprint. Departing from the traditional measurement techniques, we used machine learning, NLP, and CATA approaches to count keywords from the annual reports to understand the ESG discourse. To solve the common method variance, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity, system GMM was used as an analysis method. Managers and policymakers may have the first assessment of the gaps in the ecological footprint in order for their firms to become environmentally friendly.Using the resource-based view as the theoretical lens, we argued that VRIN-O attributes of a resource base have an inherent flaw, as they ignore "eco-friendliness."

        <p>Further research in understanding the impact of technology in solving the current ecological breakdown is due, as measures to assess this impact have not yet been developed. Also, Spash and Hache (2021) critiqued Dasgupta's (2021) approach which could be a good research agenda at the firm level. While RBV argued for resource endowment and deployment angle (Barney, 1991;Bhandari et al., 2020), further research in understanding the impact of such a resource base, and the market factors at the same time, would make the model more comprehensive, through Marx's transformation of production value into production prices (Dassler, 2020).Further research in understanding the impact of technology in solving the current ecological breakdown is due, as measures to assess this impact have not yet been developed.
