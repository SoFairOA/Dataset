        <p>Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Two factors of board composition receive attention as they strongly relate to sustainability issues: gender diversity and board independence. The aim of this study is to test whether the presence of a critical mass of women in boardrooms correlates with firm ESG performance. In addition, we aim to study whether women receiving appointment as executive rather than nonexecutive directors may positively influence ESG performance. Using a sample of Italian companies listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario during 2003-2019, the empirical results show that a critical mass of at least three female directors is necessary to improve ESG performance and that executive women directors represent a crucial component of board mechanisms, in terms of aligning the needs of stakeholders, since they increase ESG performance. Because the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value, we support the idea that female directors in strategic positions in the boardroom may benefit ESG performance. Thus, we support the idea of increasing women's presence on corporate boards and across executive leadership as a measure and a signal of how firms can respond to ESG challenges.Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.

        <p>monitoring and advising functions primarily by adjusting the respective proportions of inside and outside directors (Kim et al., 2014;Nielsen &amp; Huse, 2010). On a closer look, the role and effectiveness of women on corporate boards have garnered increased attention (García-Lara et al., 2017;Kim &amp; Starks, 2016), as board gender diversity due to its strong relation to sustainability issues (Amorelli &amp; García-Sánchez, 2020, 2021;Kyaw et al., 2022). Therefore, exploring further not only differences in gender but also in associated roles in governance is advisable, to reach a better understanding of the consequences for an ESG scenario. Recently, ESG issues and climate change have increased in popularity (Amel-Zadeh &amp; Serafeim, 2018;Huang, 2021;Sullivan &amp; Gouldson, 2017). On the one hand, the vast 'ESG movement' leads some scholars to argue that both aspects constitute the new battleground for competitive advantage and, on the other hand, firms begin to rethink and reshape their business model and purposes in a greener and more responsible way (Cornell &amp; Shapiro, 2021;Klettner et al., 2014;Rao &amp; Tilt, 2016;Rivera et al., 2022).monitoring and advising functions primarily by adjusting the respective proportions of inside and outside directors (Kim et al., 2014;Nielsen &amp; Huse, 2010).

        <p>Studies of corporate governance practices that address ESG and climate change still await thorough qualification and investigation (Buchetti et al., 2022;Galbreath, 2018;Naciti et al., 2022;Senadheera et al., 2022). From this point of view, various scholars are seeking to identify and analyse the main drivers that may encourage companies to develop sustainability activities. The extant research in this domain follows two branches: an 'out-in' approach and a strategic 'insideout' approach (Dienes et al., 2016). The present research aligns with this second scholarly stream, and a significant portion of this research considers corporate governance a driver of CSR activities (de Villiers et al., 2011;Dwekat et al., 2022;Kock et al., 2012), focusing attention, especially, on board composition (Cucari et al., 2018;Lynall et al., 2003;Post et al., 2011;Velte, 2016). However, it is neither theoretically nor empirically clear which of the two major board roles-advisory or monitoring-better suits female directors (Zalata et al., 2019), especially in ESG performance, and we contribute to filling this gap. Notably, we contribute to the literature on ESG performance by investigating the effect of female board representation from two 'angles on the same view'.Studies of corporate governance practices that address ESG and climate change still await thorough qualification and investigation (Buchetti et al., 2022;Galbreath, 2018;Naciti et al., 2022;Senadheera et al., 2022).

        <p>First, following critical mass theory, prior research has stressed the need for an increased number of women (Dobija et al., 2022;Slomka-Golebiowska et al., 2022;Torchia et al., 2011) in boardrooms, suggesting that reaching a minimum critical number enhances the ability to pursue positive outcomes, particularly in terms of disclosure (Fernandez-Feijoo et al., 2014). We thus test different minorities of women directors (one woman, two women and at least three women) to find the cut-off point of critical mass for positively affecting firm ESG performance (De Masi et al., 2021).First, following critical mass theory, prior research has stressed the need for an increased number of women (Dobija et al., 2022;Slomka-Golebiowska et al., 2022;Torchia et al., 2011) in boardrooms, suggesting that reaching a minimum critical number enhances the ability to pursue positive outcomes, particularly in terms of disclosure (Fernandez-Feijoo et al., 2014).

        <p>Second, following the trade-off perspective on board capabilities, prior research has analysed the impact of women on boards from the perspective of its correlation with the nature of the task they perform (Nielsen &amp; Huse, 2010;Rubino et al., 2021). Generally, this literature suggests outside directors contribute primarily to the monitoring function because they are independent of management. Inside directors contribute primarily to the advising function because they have more firm-specific knowledge, crucial to alleviating problems arising from information asymmetry between the board and management (Duchin et al., 2010;Linck et al., 2008). Thus, we test whether women appointed as executive/inside rather than nonexecutive/outside directors may positively influence ESG performance.Second, following the trade-off perspective on board capabilities, prior research has analysed the impact of women on boards from the perspective of its correlation with the nature of the task they perform (Nielsen &amp; Huse, 2010;Rubino et al., 2021).

        <p>To investigate our research questions, we covered a sample of Italian companies listed at the Mercato Telematico Azionario for the years 2003 through 2019. According to Seierstad et al. (2017), several EU countries have introduced specific laws adopting quotas to increase the number of women on corporate boards. The specific regulation in Italy-setting thresholds for the percentage of women on boards using a long year (2012)-makes the Italian context particularly interesting. In fact, Italy was one of the EU countries that introduced the gender board quota early on (Slomka-Golebiowska et al., 2022).To investigate our research questions, we covered a sample of Italian companies listed at the Mercato Telematico Azionario for the years 2003 through 2019.

        <p>Starting from very low-level female board representation, Italian public companies achieved one of the highest proportions of women on boards in Europe in 2015 (European Commission, 2018;Seierstad, 2016).Starting from very low-level female board representation, Italian public companies achieved one of the highest proportions of women on boards in Europe in 2015 (European Commission, 2018;Seierstad, 2016).</p>
        <p>Our results show that when women participate on the board as inside directors, they positively affect ESG performance, whereas when they are nominated as independent directors, their role risks becoming mere 'window dressing', with no positive effects for firm sustainability. In this way, we contribute to the literature on board diversity and nonfinancial performance, covering a very long period of analysis (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019). In addition, by answering our research questions, our paper contributes to several important areas of the literature. First, we respond to the call of Cuadrado-Ballesteros et al. (2017) for research studying more specific characteristics than the mere relationship between gender and CSR. Therefore, analysing the female board member's directorial role (inside/outside), we contribute to the literature on the role of women on the board by shedding light on the conditions under which women on boards can influence ESG disclosure. In this regard, we contribute to the literature by asking what roles best suit women directors, specifically focusing on advisory and monitoring roles (Cambrea et al., 2019;Zalata et al., 2019), in the sustainability context. Finally, we contribute to shedding light on the scarce literature regarding board composition and ESG in Italy.Our results show that when women participate on the board as inside directors, they positively affect ESG performance, whereas when they are nominated as independent directors, their role risks becoming mere 'window dressing', with no positive effects for firm sustainability.

        <p>The implementation of a strategy depends on proper deployment of the organisation's resources and capabilities (Husted &amp; Allen, 2007;Minutolo et al., 2019). In this context, the literature suggests that the board of directors (BoD) plays a main role, representing the basic and most relevant corporate governance mechanism as well as being ultimately responsible for the long-term success of the company (Klettner et al., 2014;Stiles, 2001;Wheelen et al., 2017).The implementation of a strategy depends on proper deployment of the organisation's resources and capabilities (Husted &amp; Allen, 2007;Minutolo et al., 2019).

        <p>In this context, the most debated issue concerns whether and to what extent boards must rely on outside and/or 'diverse' (in terms of gender) directors to assist them in elaborating and reviewing corporate strategy (Gani &amp; Jermias, 2006;Rao &amp; Tilt, 2016). Therefore, the importance of the BoD is primarily studied through the lenses of independence and diversity. Previous research examining the effect of demographic diversity on firm outcomes (Harrison &amp; Klein, 2007;Miller &amp; del Carmen Triana, 2009) has included gender diversity as a proxy for other heterogeneity constructs (Kirsch, 2018). That is, female directors differ from their male counterparts in specific ways that will influence how they monitor managers and the resources they bring to board deliberations (Hillman &amp; Dalziel, 2003).In this context, the most debated issue concerns whether and to what extent boards must rely on outside and/or 'diverse' (in terms of gender) directors to assist them in elaborating and reviewing corporate strategy (Gani &amp; Jermias, 2006;Rao &amp; Tilt, 2016).

        <p>Existing research presents three theoretical perspectives that suggest greater gender diversity may have a positive effect on board effectiveness and long-term performance: agency theory, resource dependency and gender role theory (Terjesen et al., 2016(Terjesen et al., , 2009)). Furthermore, two additional perspectives may better explain the relation of gender diversity to board effectiveness, namely, informationprocessing and decision-making perspective (Van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007) and social categorisation theory (Brewer, 2007;Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004).Existing research presents three theoretical perspectives that suggest greater gender diversity may have a positive effect on board effectiveness and long-term performance: agency theory, resource dependency and gender role theory (Terjesen et al., 2016(Terjesen et al., , 2009)).

        <p>According to Francoeur et al. (2008), the agency theory perspective suggests that female directors often bring fresh perspective on complex issues, successfully supporting strategy formulation and problem-solving. Other contributions found that women are more likely to ask questions (Bilimoria &amp; Wheeler, 2000) and generally support higher ethical standards for their companies (Pan &amp; Sparks, 2012). In addition, the quality of board meetings may benefit from the presence of female directors; female directors generally prepare more for board meetings (Pathan &amp; Faff, 2013) and attend more board reunions (Adams &amp; Ferreira, 2009).According to Francoeur et al.

        <p>The resource dependence theory represents the second perspective, as women on boards lead to more valuable resources (Terjesen et al., 2016). Other contributions point out that females have more diverse networks than males (Ibarra, 1992). Directors with different characteristics influence corporate decision-making and performance through their differences in cognition, knowledge, experience and other aspects. From the cognitive perspective, the diversified nature of board members produces a differentiated cognitive structure that could improve the decision-making quality that faces irregular problems (Johnson et al., 2013).The resource dependence theory represents the second perspective, as women on boards lead to more valuable resources (Terjesen et al., 2016).

        <p>The third perspective, which Eagly (1987) pioneered as 'gender role theory', asserts that 'an individual's gender determines his/her behavior and its effectiveness with respect to influence' (Terjesen et al., 2016, p. 6). It indicates how male and female directors normatively prescribe behaviour with respect to communication. Specifically, women are more likely to assume more feminine roles, such as sympathy and gentility (Eagly, 1987). On the other hand, men will more likely be assertive and aggressive. According to Rosener (1995), flexibility represents one of the main gender roles associated with females, which may lead to better ability to manage controversial or ambiguous situations. Gender roles are relevant for the board; directors must use communication tactics that are effectively influential (Terjesen et al., 2016).The third perspective, which Eagly (1987) pioneered as 'gender role theory', asserts that 'an individual's gender determines his/her behavior and its effectiveness with respect to influence' (Terjesen et al., 2016, p. 6).

        <p>Moreover, a further perspective that needs consideration refers to the information-processing and decision-making perspective (Van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007). Board gender diversity should lead to better firm outcomes. From this perspective, diversity allows greater access to different ideas, skills and points of view, fostering constructive debate and, thereby, stimulating creativity and more effective decision-making (Certo &amp; Semadeni, 2006;Heavey &amp; Simsek, 2013;Talke et al., 2010). This positive view of diversity as variety (Harrison &amp; Klein, 2007) also implies that diverse groups have greater cognitive resources (i.e. distinct experience, knowledge, abilities and skills) and, as such, should be better able to bring differing views, opinions and perspectives to problem-solving. Furthermore, board gender diversity could be valuable in helping to reduce 'groupthink'. Diversity often leads to discussion of conflicting points of view and creates friction, enhancing deliberation and reducing errors and conformity (Van Dick et al., 2008;Van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007). Therefore, more gender-diverse boards should analyse information more thoroughly before coming to a conclusion (Levi et al., 2014). According to Pucheta-Martínez et al. (2021), women directors play a relevant moderating role in corporate social and environmental disclosure as a sustainable development tool.Moreover, a further perspective that needs consideration refers to the information-processing and decision-making perspective (Van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007).

        <p>Finally, social categorisation theory (Brewer, 2007;Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004) posits that demographic diversity makes diverse teams potentially less effective because they are more difficult to coordinate. Majority-male groups could respond negatively to female directors in the decision-making process and negatively affect team outcomes. Gender diversity as separation (Harrison &amp; Klein, 2007) can reflect differences in beliefs, values and experiences of team members, potentially leading to social categorisation effects in the team.Finally, social categorisation theory (Brewer, 2007;Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004) posits that demographic diversity makes diverse teams potentially less effective because they are more difficult to coordinate.

        <p>From this perspective, differences and similarities are the basis for placing unlike and like into groups, resulting in potential discrimination between in-and out-groups (Brewer, 2007). People display a bias towards favouring and trusting in-group members more than outgroup members (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004). Thus, from this perspective, we would expect lower-level performance in firms with more genderdiverse boards.From this perspective, differences and similarities are the basis for placing unlike and like into groups, resulting in potential discrimination between in-and out-groups (Brewer, 2007).

        <p>Women are obviously different from male counterparts in several aspects (i.e. experience and values), and boards need several of their characteristics, such as their increased diversity of opinions and ability to improve the corporate image with stakeholder groups (Burgess &amp; Tharenou, 2002;Galbreath, 2018). Moreover, women famously enhance firms' reputation (Bear et al., 2010;Brammer et al., 2009) and add different perspectives, experiences and expertise to men's (Daily &amp; Dalton, 2003;Hillman et al., 2001), also because of their greater wisdom and diligence (Huse &amp; Grethe Solberg, 2006). Women directors contribute a more independent view to the board (Fondas, 2000), and they can change the strategic direction of the firm (Selby, 2000). These characteristics cause women directors to be positively related to CSR outcomes, and the literature consistently claims that a positive relationship exists between women directors and socially responsible activities (Ferrero-Ferrero et al., 2015;Post et al., 2011). Prior research argues that women directors improve strategic decision-making and play a fundamental role in establishing positive values, in terms such as reducing carbon emissions (Kassinis et al., 2016;Nuber &amp; Velte, 2021), especially when they are highly educated and pushing the firm to be more 'green' (Atif et al., 2020;De Silva &amp; Pownall, 2014).

        <p>In this regard, critical mass theory (Granovetter, 1978;Kanter, 1977Kanter, , 1987) ) argues that group subgroups' size affects interactions. According to this theory, only when the size of subgroups reaches a certain critical mass will they really be able to affect firm strategy. Prior studies have suggested that as a subgroup, women directors reach critical mass when boards of directors have at least three women (Erkut et al., 2008;Konrad et al., 2008), and only with that minimum threshold can they influence board dynamics and processes. For instance, Torchia et al. (2011) found that at least three women must be on the board to positively affect innovation. Very recently, Kyaw et al. (2022) confirmed that companies with at least three females on their BoD have better performance when it comes to emissions.In this regard, critical mass theory (Granovetter, 1978;Kanter, 1977Kanter, , 1987) ) argues that group subgroups' size affects interactions. According to this theory, only when the size of subgroups reaches a certain critical mass will they really be able to affect firm strategy.

        <p>Following prior research results, we thus expect that only when the number of women directors increases from 'tokens' to constituting a consistent part of the board will they be able to influence the level of firm environmental performance. Specifically, we expect that only boards that have reached a minimum threshold of three women board members will be able to affect environmental performance; with only one or two women, we expect their role to be more a form of tokenism, with no effects on firm sustainability. Therefore, we hypothesise the following: Hp 1a. There is no relationship between one woman director and the level of firm ESG performance.Following prior research results, we thus expect that only when the number of women directors increases from 'tokens' to constituting a consistent part of the board will they be able to influence the level of firm environmental performance.

        <p>Going beyond the mere participation of women directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major board member roles (advisory versus monitoring) women directors play best to achieve ESG performance. For example, according to Croci et al. (2020), the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value and firm resilience differently, and the gender composition of the board can improve the quality of monitoring activities (Campbell &amp; Mínguez-Vera, 2008). Indeed, from this point of view, scholars generally recognise two primary roles for boards (monitoring and advising) and the literature distinguishes between two corresponding types of directors (executive and nonexecutive directors). Executive directors, usually called 'insiders', are officers of the company who serve as board members (Cruz et al., 2019), often gaining their position through internal career progression (Burgess &amp; Tharenou, 2002). Insiders who 'are corporate executives and therefore tend to be closely involved in dayto-day corporate decisions' (Ibrahim &amp; Angelidis, 1995, p. 409) are more sensitive to the organisation's economic needs than philanthropic goals. On the other hand, the board chair or a nominating committee invites nonexecutive directors, also called 'outsiders' or 'independent directors' (Burgess &amp; Tharenou, 2002). Specifically, an outside director is 'a director who is not a present or former employee of the firm and whose only formal connection with the firm is his duties as a director' (Rosenstein &amp; Wyatt, 1990, p. 177). Independent directors function as a fundamental mechanism for ensuring that firms pursue not only shareholders' interests but also those of all stakeholders (García-Sánchez &amp; Martínez-Ferrero, 2017; Haniffa &amp; Cooke, 2005). The presence of independent directors is fundamental to increasing the efforts for longer-term-oriented strategies, such as CSR (Jo &amp; Harjoto, 2011). Therefore, boards with more independent directors can motivate companies to be more sustainably responsible (Khan, 2010), especially because their reputation directly links with the ethical responsibility of the firms that appoint them (Cabeza-García et al., 2018).Going beyond the mere participation of women directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major board member roles (advisory versus monitoring) women directors play best to achieve ESG performance.

        <p>To summarise, a common assumption is that inside directors are the primary source of firm-specific information that advising requires, while outside directors provide better monitoring because they are independent of management (Kim et al., 2014). Prior research has indeed shown that independent directors are fundamental for CSR disclosure (Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2009), bringing the firm to a higher degree of transparency (Amran et al., 2014). Outside directors have a greater corporate social responsiveness orientation than inside directors, who have a stronger orientation towards economic performance (Ibrahim &amp; Angelidis, 1995). Outside board members are also more likely than inside directors to be more sensitive to society's needs (Ibrahim &amp; Angelidis, 1995), and they have a key role in protecting more than only the shareholders' interests, thanks to their CSR orientation being stronger than insiders' (O'Neill et al., 1989). In sum, outside directors have a broader range of experience and interests (Vance, 1983) and a greater social responsiveness (Zahra &amp; Stanton, 1988) than inside directors.To summarise, a common assumption is that inside directors are the primary source of firm-specific information that advising requires, while outside directors provide better monitoring because they are independent of management (Kim et al., 2014).

        <p>However, this study's objective is not to test whether board independence affects ESG. Rather, we aim to study whether women who serve as an executive rather than nonexecutive directors may have a positive influence on ESG performance. This idea relates to what roles best suit female directors, with a specific focus on advisory and monitoring roles. For this reason, we may assume that both inside and outside directors represent an important source of firm-specific information, and they have a leading role in decision-making processes.However, this study's objective is not to test whether board independence affects ESG.

        <p>Therefore, we argue that when women serve as executive (inside) directors, they will really be able to head firm strategy and transfer their values to the corporate culture. Furthermore, we also argue that when women are independent (outside) directors, they will more likely head firm strategy and communicate their values in the organisation, producing better performance. In sum, we expect that women directors involved as executive and independent directors will have the power to really provide their voice to the boardroom and the whole firm, with positive effects for environmental performance.Therefore, we argue that when women serve as executive (inside) directors, they will really be able to head firm strategy and transfer their values to the corporate culture.

Therefore, avoiding groupthink and analysing differing points of view are especially important to developing new and creative solutions to difficult tasks (Post et al., 2021) and, more generally, to increase public trust in business and drive economic growth.
