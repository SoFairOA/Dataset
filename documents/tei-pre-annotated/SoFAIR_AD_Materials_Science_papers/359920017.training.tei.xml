        <p>Graphene fragments spanning a wide range of size and shape were studied computationally using the Debye scattering equation. The calculated diffraction patterns were analyzed using the Scherrer equation to infer the fragment size, La. Comparison with the known fragment sizes reveals a strong affine relationship between La and the Scherrer quantity λ/(B cos θ). To preserve this relationship, we propose modifying the Scherrer equation to include an empirical additive constant. Our approach solves the well-known problem of size-dependence in the shape factor and yields a universal expression by defining La as the square-root of the fragment area. The relationship between observed diffraction peak positions and unit cell parameters is also discussed.Graphene fragments spanning a wide range of size and shape were studied computationally using the Debye scattering equation.

        <p>The most important parameter in the Scherrer equation is the quantity K, also known as the shape factor. In 1918, Scherrer [2] derived a general value of K=0.94, while the first derivation of a shape factor specific for carbon was by Warren in 1941 [3], who proposed using K=1.84 for L a . This value, which was calculated using rhombus-shaped fragments, remains in common use. Another widely-used shape factor is K=0.89, which was derived by WL Bragg [4] and first used for carbon L c values by Biscoe &amp; Warren [5]. In later work, Warren and Bodenstein [6] performed analysis on circular fragments and proposed K=1.77 for L a . The choice of K was again revisited in 2004 by Iwashita et al. [7] who performed inter-laboratory tests and suggested a single universal value of K=1 for all crystallite directions. In a separate article, Warren and Bodenstein [8] also reported a further complexity whereby the L a shape-factor is sizedependent, varying from 1.1 up to 2.0. This leads to a circular argument whereby K depends on L a , which in turn depends on K. This problem was recently examined by Fujimoto [9], Dopita et al. [10] who used the Debye scattering equation [11] to study stacked graphitic layers of varying size and shape. Both studies noted a significant size-dependence for small fragments with L a 100 Å.The most important parameter in the Scherrer equation is the quantity K, also known as the shape factor.

        <p>In this work we revisit the Scherrer equation using a large set of graphene fragments of varying shape and size. Using the Debye scattering equation and an intuitive area-based definition of L a , we identify a strong affine correlation between L a and the quantity λ/(B cos θ) defined in Eq. 1. Based on this observation, we introduce a modified Scherrer equation which includes a small additive constant. This new form eliminates almost all of the size-dependence, is independent of the diffraction peak, and works equally well for a variety of regular polygons.In this work we revisit the Scherrer equation using a large set of graphene fragments of varying shape and size.

        <p>This form is easy to interpret: for a square fragment L a is just the side length, while for other regular shapes a simple relationship can be determined. For example, a circle of diameter D has L a = D × √ π/2 ≈ 0.89D while a 60 • rhombus of side-length D has L a = D × (3/4) 1/4 ≈ 0.93D. Using these geometric factors, it is straightforward to convert common literature values of the Scherrer shape factor to their Eq. 3 equivalents: K=1.84 for a rhombus becomes 1.98, while K=1.77 for a circle becomes 2.00. Assuming a graphene lattice parameter of 2.46 Å, Eq. 3 can also be written in the equivalent form L a = 1.618 √ N where N is the number of atoms and L a is in ångströms. With this expression, fragments of arbitrary shape can be easily categorized without recourse to complicated definitions.This form is easy to interpret: for a square fragment L a is just the side length, while for other regular shapes a simple relationship can be determined.

        <p>Ideal graphene fragments of varying shape (circular, hexagonal, square, rhombus and elliptical; see Fig. 1) and size (L a ≈ 25-690 Å) were generated by tiling a two-dimensional unit cell of length 2.46 Å, internal angle 120 • , and containing two carbon atoms at fractional coordinates 1 3 , 2 3 and 2 3 , 1 3 .

With sufficiently narrow bins, the simplified Debye diffraction equation significantly reduces computation time with little loss in diffraction intensity accuracy. Diffraction patterns were generated using Eq. 6 over a Q range of 1-20 Å-1 with a step size of 0.0005 Å-1 and bin intervals of 0.01 Å. Further reduction of the bin intervals had no substantive effect on the peak width or intensity. These patterns were converted to a conventional 2θ axis by setting λ = 0.7093 Å, the wavelength of molybdenum Kα radiation. This allows for the analysis of the ( 21) and (30) diffraction peaks, which are not normally accessible using copper Kα radiation. An example diffraction pattern is given in Fig. 2. The ( 10), ( 11), (21), and (30) diffraction peaks of the graphene fragments were analysed to determine the factor λ/(B cos θ) in the Scherrer equation. The process for determining B and θ is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2. The value of θ is taken as the position of the peak maximum, while B is the full-width-half-maximum relative to a background indicated by the dashed line. The background was determined for each peak of interest, and was set as a straight line from the two appropriate minima to the left and right of the peak.

        <p>The results that form the basis of our analysis are summarized in Fig. 3. Solid circles indicate data calculated from the diffraction patterns, while the lines are straightline regression fits to data for each peak; for clarity, data for the (30) peak is not shown. The correlation in all 24 data sets is excellent and the linearity extends to the limit of the data at L a ≈ 690 Å. Mathematically, this indicates that L a and λ/(B cos θ) are well-described by an affine (y = mx + c) relation. The values of m and c for all peak and shape combinations are summarized in Table I. The uncertainties are of order 0.01 for m and 1 Å for c. Importantly, the data indicates that there is a statistically significant non-zero y-intercept for all shapes and peaks, with c varying between -10 and -25 Å. The Table also shows that the gradient is close to two for most situations, with only the irregular shapes showing any appreciable deviation.The results that form the basis of our analysis are summarized in Fig. 3.

        <p>The constant c in the affine relationship provides an elegant explanation for why multiple studies have observed a size-dependence in the shape factor. Specifically, the variation in K with L a observed by Warren &amp; Bodenstein [8] and others [9,10] can be reproduced by fitting the data in Fig. 3 with Eq. 1 to explicitly solve for K for each value of L a . In the absence of the parameter c, the shape factor K neccessarily varies with L a as shown in Fig. 4, which shows the variation in K with L a for the circle and rhombus; K is of order unity for small values of L a , and increases monotonically to a value of approximately two for large fragments. This is precisely the variation seen in the literature and is a consequence of the affine parameter c having a negative value. Also shown in Fig. 4 are the asymptotic limits for the two wellknown literature values of K (1.77 for a circle and 1.84 for a rhombus). In both cases K has been converted to its equivalent values according to our definition of L a in Eq. 3. For large values of L a , our analysis reproduces the literature results, confirming the validity of our simulated diffraction approach. The merit of our area-based definition of L a is demonstrated in Fig. 5. Here we replot the data in Fig. 3, this time grouping by peak. It can be seen that the data for the regular polygons and the low-eccentricity ellipse effectively lie on a universal line, with only the highly eccentric ellipse showing any significant deviation. Data for the rhombus (not shown) lies midway between these two groups. The (21) and (30) peaks exhibit the exact same behaviour, showing that these trends are not specific to any particular layer shape or peak. Close inspection of Table I reveals the same trends seen in Fig. 5 in the form of clustering of m and c for each peak. Prior to selecting Eq. 3 as our definition of L a , we also explored an alternative form, L a = 4 × area/perimeter, which is conceptually similar to the definition for circles by Warren &amp; Bodenstein [6]. Although we still observed an affine rela- tionship for all shapes and peaks, there was considerable spread in the m and c values, and the data for different shapes did not coincide on a universal line.The constant c in the affine relationship provides an elegant explanation for why multiple studies have observed a size-dependence in the shape factor.

        <p>The universal behaviour for regular shapes seen in Fig. 5 can be usefully understood by comparing the eccentricity to the average gradient for each shape as computed using the data for the four peaks in Table I. The data in Fig. 6 shows that a average gradient of two applies for a wide range of shapes. Only for the rhombus and the more eccentric ellipse does the gradient begin to deviate, and even then, the trend is monotonic. As noted earlier, the literature values of K=1.84 for the rhombus and K=1.77 for the circle are equivalent to 1.98 and 2.00 with our area-based definition.

        <p>where K =2 and c is a constant to be determined. Fitting simultaneously to the three regular polygons (circle, hexagon, square) yields a value of -16 Å, similar to the values of c in Table I. While one could conceive of a Scherrer equation with values of K and c specific to each peak, from a practical point of view it is preferable to use K =2 and c=-16 Å for all situations. To quantify the error that this introduces, we reanalyzed our data using Eq. 7 and compared each predicted value of L a to the actual value for the fragment. The percentage error for each shape and size is shown in Fig. 7(a) for the (10) peak. Even though the values of K and c are not optimized to any particular peak or shape, the error introduced by Eq. 7 is never greater than 15%, and for large fragments with uniform shape is typically only a few percent.where K =2 and c is a constant to be determined.

        <p>To put these numbers into perspective, the sizedependence implicit in the conventional Scherrer equation introduces an effective uncertainty of nearly 100% due to the variation of K between 1.1 and 2.0. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in the literature regarding the appropriate choice of K, to which is added an ambiguous definition of L a . As shown by Warren &amp; Bodenstein [8], the choice of diffraction peak can also alter K by around 30%. All of these problems are resolved with our area-based definition of L a together with the use of an additive constant in the Scherrer equation. While we don't have a physical explanation for why this modi-fication is so successful, the empirical support for such a term is strong. Due to the negative additive constant, our proposed modification will necessarily fail for extremely small values of λ/(B cos θ). The onset of breakdown can be seen in Fig. 7(a) where the affine relationship begins to change for the smallest L a values of 25 Å and below this value we do not recommend the use of our coefficients. In practice, we do not expect this lower limit to be a significant issue, as genuine graphitic structures with L a below 30 Å have not been found, and in the words of Ref. [14], "will probably never be".To put these numbers into perspective, the sizedependence implicit in the conventional Scherrer equation introduces an effective uncertainty of nearly 100% due to the variation of K between 1.1 and 2.0.

        <p>In summary, we have studied 2D graphene fragments of various shapes and sizes by analysing simulated Xray diffraction patterns. The layer size of the graphene fragments varied between 25 and 690 Å and was defined as the square-root of the area. For all diffraction peaks over the entire size-range, a strong affine relationship was found between L a and the Scherrer quantity λ/(B cos θ). Deviations in the gradient correlate with an increase in the eccentricity of the fragment. To preserve this affine relationship, we modify the Scherrer equation to include an emprical additive constant. Fitting to the principal peaks of the regular shapes yields the expression L a = 2λ/(B cos θ) -16, where the layer size is in ångströms.In summary, we have studied 2D graphene fragments of various shapes and sizes by analysing simulated Xray diffraction patterns.

It also results in universal behaviour whereby data for regular shapes falls on a common line.Our analysis also provides an explanation for a sizedependency problem reported in the literature for the conventional Scherrer equation, which assumes c=0.

        <p>The simplicity of our computational approach suggests other areas where a similar approach can be applied. For example, it would be valuable to revisit the data of Fujimoto [9] and Dopita et al. [10] to test whether an affine relationship exists for L c in their stacked graphitic layer systems. It would also be straightforward to study curvature by bending the graphene layers cylindrically or by introducing pentagons and/or heptagons. Aside from carbon, there are also many other analogous 2D and layered-2D materials such as boron nitride, phosphorene, and MoS 2 , where a robust measure of L a would be valuable.The simplicity of our computational approach suggests other areas where a similar approach can be applied.

        <p>It has been shown by Warren [3], and noted by Fujimoto [9] and Dopita et al. [10], that the position of the peak maximum of an (hk) reflection and the position of the same reflection calculated from crystallographic parameters do not exactly coincide. Although this does not affect our calculations of L a in any meaningful way, the differences should be taken into account when calculating unit cell parameters, especially for small layer sizes. The shift in peak position can be represented by ∆(sin θ) = sin θ max. -sin θ cryst. = U λ L a + V (8) where λ is the wavelength, U and V are empirical parameters and the position of the peak maximum and crystallographic peak are given by sin θ max. and sin θ cryst. , respectively. Values of U and V for each of the shapes and reflections are listed in Table II, where L a in Eqn. 8 is calculated from the corresponding values in Table I.It has been shown by Warren [3], and noted by Fujimoto [9] and Dopita et al.

        <p>In an experimental setting the shape will not be known, and hence it is preferable to calculate the layer size using Eqn. 7 with K =2 and c=-16 Å. Fitting simultaneously to the (10), (11), and (21) peaks of the three regular polygons, yields U =0.156 and V =9.9 Å. These values allow for the accurate determination of unit cell parameters for carbons over a wide range of layer size. (11) peak maximum (solid line in inset) with respect to the position of the reflection calwith crystallographic parameters (dashed line in inset). All peaks and shapes show the same relationship. La was calculated from the diffraction data using Eqn. 7 with K =2 and c=-16 Å. The continuous line represents a fit through the data for the regular shapes.In an experimental setting the shape will not be known, and hence it is preferable to calculate the layer size using Eqn. 7 with K =2 and c=-16 Å.
