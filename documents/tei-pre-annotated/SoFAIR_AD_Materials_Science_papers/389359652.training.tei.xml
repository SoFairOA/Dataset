        <p>The functionalization of silica-coated, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, with an ironcontaining ionic liquid, allows for the synthesis of a Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim) [FeCl 4 ] system that can be employed as a magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst. Herein, we present the use of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim) [FeCl 4 ] for the glycolysis of PET into BHET under conventional heating. The catalyst achieved nearly 100% yield and selectivity over twelve consecutive reaction cycles at 180 °C and was efficiently recovered without tedious work-up or purification processes. Additional analyses revealed that the amount of catalyst lost after each cycle was negligible and no trace of Fe was found in the purified BHET product.The functionalization of silica-coated, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, with an ironcontaining ionic liquid, allows for the synthesis of a Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim) [FeCl 4 ] system that can be employed as a magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst.

        <p>Nowadays, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the fourth most manufactured plastic polymer, after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). The global PET production in 2014 amounted to some 42 million metric tons and it is predicted to increase to approximately 74 million metric tons by 2020. [1] However, its manufacture and use presents many problems, including the requirement of non-renewable fossil fuel precursors, the astonishing amount of waste generated, and the CO 2 emissions related to both the production and disposal of PET products. [2] Therefore, the recycling of postconsumer PET is essential to save energy and protect our environment. [3] Chemical recycling of PET waste involves the partial or total depolymerisation of this polymer into its monomers and oligomers, which can then be re-polymerised to yield recycled PET. [4] Common depolymerization routes employed for chemical recycling of PET are methanolysis, hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis, ammonolysis and hydrogenation, among others. [5] In this context, glycolysis is a very convenient method due to its simplicity and low cost, but the non-catalysed process is very slow. [6] This transformation has been described by the use of a wide range of catalysts, such as metal acetates, titanium phosphate, solid superacids, carbonates, sulfates, deep eutectic solvents, nanoparticles, and microbial agents. [7,8,9,10,11] In particular, ionic liquids (ILs) have been increasingly explored as catalysts for PET glycolysis since the first report in 2009. [12] In a subsequent publication, Zhang et al. described the use of halometallate-based ILs for the depolymerization of PET in ethylene glycol (EG). [13] These acidic ILs operate as bifunctional catalysts acting simultaneously as a Lewis acid and nucleophile, showing higher activities and selectivities than those observed by the use of simple metal salts or solely organic ILs. Despite their advantages, in terms of selectivity and yield, only a few examples have been described where catalyst recovery is achieved employing expensive techniques, such as vacuum distillation. [14,15,16,17] If the catalyst recycling problem was solved, for example by immobilization using inorganic supports, halometallate-based ILs could be applicable in industrial processes. In this context, surface functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) is an important and emerging area in the catalysis field. [18,19] Specifically, silica-coated magnetite nano-supports have attracted much attention due to their unique properties, such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, economic viability and simple preparation methods. [18] More importantly, retrieval of the NPs via magnetic separation provides an elegant alternative to cumbersome filtration, vacuum distillation, or centrifugation techniques in terms of time, energy and efficiency of catalyst retention. [20,21] Inspired by these works, we report a new, highly active, bifunctional catalytic system, Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] (mim: methylimidazolium), that provides nearly 100% selectivity and yield in the glycolysis of PET in EG at T&lt;180 °C. This thermally-stable, high-surface area nanocatalyst combines high activity with a facile magnetic recovery method and can be reused for up to 15 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case which describes the surface modification of nano-magnetite materials with paramagnetic ILs (MILs), opening the door to the design of new nanomaterials with a wide range of possible functional groups in the shell. The depolymerization of PET catalyzed by magnetic NPs has been described for metal oxide spinel, [22] Mn 3 O 4 [23] and γ-Fe 2 O 3 . [24] However, the obtained BHET has often low purity and the required temperatures are higher (260-300 °C) than those used for this novel nanocatalyst.Nowadays, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the fourth most manufactured plastic polymer, after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS).

        <p>For the catalytic experiments, 15 mg of catalyst, 100 mg of PET and 1 mL of EG, were placed in a 10 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser.

        <p>The nanostructured catalyst 2 has been extensively characterized by TGA, XRPD, TEM, EDX, HR-TEM, XPS, and magnetic measurements. TGA revealed that 2 is thermally stable up to 250 °C (Figure S1, Supporting Information), confirming the durability of the system at temperatures employed in the catalytic experiments. XRPD analysis (Figure S2, Supporting Information) showed the presence of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and indicated that the mean NP diameter to be 9.2 nm. In addition, the XRPD spectrum of 2 presents a broad peak between 15 and 25° (2θ) that corresponds to the amorphous SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] shells. [28] TEM analysis revealed the presence of well-dispersed and approximately-spherical nanoparticles with an average size ca. 11 ± 1 nm (Figures S6-S11, Supporting Information). Moreover, HR-TEM images (Figure 1) showed crystalline nanoparticles compatible with the characteristic face centered cubic (fcc) pattern for Fe 3 O 4 crystals viewed along with the [311] axis with predominant lattice fringe distance of 0.253 nm (core) covered by an amorphous layer of SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] of ranging between 0.5-2.0 nm in thickness. The observed thickness of the silica (Figure 1b) also depends on the angle that the particle is imaged at. For example, tilting of the TEM sample holder through 20° in the x-axis showed that the apparent thickness could decrease by approximately 20% (See figure S12, Supporting Information). XPS measurements confirmed the presence of the imidazolium cation in the shell (Figure 2a). The Fe 2p 3/2 signal (Figure 2c) was deconvoluted into two components associated to Fe 2+ (709.4 eV) and Fe 3+ (712.4 eV), which correspond to Fe 3 O 4 oxidation states [29] and are in agreement with XRPD and HRTEM results. The signal associated with FeCl 4 overlaps with a very intense Fe 3 O 4 NP core signal, but the Cl 2p signal suggested the presence of a thin FeCl 4 layer on the nanoparticle surface (Figure 2b). Indeed, EDX corroborated the presence of Fe, Cl, Si and O in the sample (Figure S14, Supporting Information). In addition, a STEM-EDX elemental map over a single Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] particle (Figures S15 andS16) showed the presence of Fe, Cl, Si and O in the shell, proving the presence of the iron-containing ionic liquid in the surface of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 . Elemental analysis gave a halometallate-based IL content of ca. 20.6% in 2, which is supported by TGA (ca. 17.3%, see figure S1, Supporting Information). The magnetic susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature (Figure S17a, Supporting Information) showed typical features of single domain nanoparticles with a broad size distribution due to random dipolar interactions. The magnetic analysis (Section 6, Supporting Information) proved that a spin glass (SG)-like, rather than superparamagnetic freezing, seems to be occurring within the sample. Moreover, the response of magnetization to the applied magnetic field (Figure S17b, Supporting Information) is characteristic of an assembly of NPs. Finally, the fitting of the M(H) curves with the numerical inversion method [30] (Figure S18, Supporting Information) provided a value for the average size of 9.3  (1) nm, in good agreement with XRPD and TEM data.The nanostructured catalyst 2 has been extensively characterized by TGA, XRPD, TEM, EDX, HR-TEM, XPS, and magnetic measurements.

Finally, the fitting of the M(H) curves with the numerical inversion method [30] (Figure S18, Supporting Information) provided a value for the average size of 9.3  (1) nm, in good agreement with XRPD and TEM data.</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] MNPs (2) was evaluated for the glycolysis of PET in EG under conventional heating conditions (for further details see section 2.4.1). We employed PET pellets purchased from Goodfellow Inc. (diameter 3-5 mm). The BHET product was obtained with high purity (Figures S20 andS21, Supporting Information) by crystallization in water at 4 °C (for further details see section 2.4.1). This was confirmed using a wide range of techniques, such as TGA, DSC, FT-IR, XRPD, ESI-MS, 1 H and 13 C NMR, and GC-MS (Section 8 and figures S22-S29, Supporting Information). Moreover, no traces of Fe were found in the purified product by scanning electron microscope (SEM), which proves the suitability of the described procedure to obtain highly pure BHET that can be employed in subsequent applications.The catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] MNPs (2) was evaluated for the glycolysis of PET in EG under conventional heating conditions (for further details see section 2.4.1).

        <p>The first set of experiments was carried out with a reaction temperature of 170 °C (160 °C inside the reaction flask). The conversion of PET and the yield of BHET product reached up to 63 and 59%, respectively (Figure 3). The comparison of these results with those observed for the analogous nonsupported halometallate-based IL (dimim) [FeCl 4 ] at the same temperature (99% conversion and 78% yield for 0.085 mmol catalyst and 125 mg PET) [31] indicates that the activity of 2 is lower. However, we have to bear in mind that the catalyst loading is a crucial factor in the glycolysis of PET [16] and the amount of catalytically active material is much lower in 2 (ca. 0.01 mmol of MIL in 15 mg of 2 employed for 100 mg PET), since the catalyst is present only in the shell of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @(mim)[FeCl 4 ] NPs. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the activity in the second cycle of catalyst recovery and reuse for (dimim)[FeCl 4 ] (from 99 to 5% yield) due to a gradual loss and/or decomposition of the catalyst as a consequence of the repeated washing cycles. [31] However, the nanocatalyst 2 was magnetically recyclable in 3 min (Figure 4, for further details see section 2.4.2), which represents an easy retrieval method compared to the tedious and expensive procedures mentioned previously. Indeed, the recovered nanocatalyst was reused for up to fifteen cycles at 160 °C showing good recycling performance (Figure 3). In addition, a variable activity was observed for the different cycles. At this temperature, unreacted or partly reacted polymer was adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface, which hinders the complete separation of the catalyst from substrate and products during the recycling process, and thus leads to a fluctuation in the results. This has been demonstrated by performing a TGA of the nanoparticles after reaction at 160 ºC (Figure S40), which shows a 16.4% of adsorbed organic material. The catalytic activity of 2, containing a Lewis acid and a nucleophile within the structure, was also compared with that observed for ILs supported on NPs.

        <p>(3) of 11  (1) nm were synthesized and characterized by XRPD, TEM and XPS (Figures S3, S13 and S19, Supporting Information). [27] Although 3 exhibits similar recycling behavior as 2, and can be reused up to 15 cycles (Figure S30, Supporting Information), the reaction showed lower activity (up to 40% conversion of PET and 36% yield of BHET), thus proving the importance of the halometallate complex in the catalytic process. The reaction mechanism in the glycolysis of PET catalysed by 2 is well aligned with that accepted for PET degradation mediated by imidazolium-based metal-containing ionic liquids, which is a Lewis acid catalytic process; [14,15,16] both the imidazolium cation and metal complex anion play a key synergic role through hydrogen-bonding interactions with EG and the ester groups of PET, [32] leading to enhanced activities and selectivities compared to those observed for purely organic imidazolium-based ILs. [13,31] The reaction temperature is a critical factor in the glycolysis of PET catalyzed by ILs where higher temperatures favor the formation of BHET. [12] As 2 is stable up to 220 °C, another set of glycolysis reactions with the same experimental setting were carried out at 190 °C (180 °C inside the reaction flask). Interestingly, the activity of 2 improved significantly and, as can be seen in figure 5, quantitative conversions of PET and yields of BHET product were obtained. Conversely, the analogous non-supported iron-containing IL (dimim)[FeCl 4 ] only gave 80% conversion and 50% yield under the same reaction conditions.

        <p>Furthermore, the catalytic system remained active in the fifteenth cycle of recovery and reuse at 160 °C. Additional studies showed that the amount of catalyst lost after each cycle was minimal, proving the efficacy of the magnetic separation procedure. The absence of even trace amounts of Fe in the purified product further illustrates the benefits of the described methodology to obtain highly pure BHET for potential reuse.Furthermore, the catalytic system remained active in the fifteenth cycle of recovery and reuse at 160 °C.
