        <p>Organic long-persistent-luminescent (OLPL) materials demonstrating hour-long photoluminescence have practical advantages in applications owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the energy absorbed in these materials is typically stored in an intermediate charge-separated state that is unstable when exposed to oxygen, thus preventing persistent luminescence in air unless oxygen penetration is suppressed through crystallization. Moreover, OLPL materials usually require ultraviolet excitation.

        <p>Long-persistent luminescence (LPL) is a phenomenon in which emission continues for a long period after photoexcitation 1 . LPL emitters are used as glow-in-the-dark paints for clock faces and emergency lights. High-efficiency LPL materials are composed of metal-oxide microcrystals and small amounts of rare-earth ions that act as chargetrapping and emission sites 2,3 . In these inorganic LPL materials, holes or electrons generated by the photoexcitation of the metal-oxide crystal are accumulated in dopants that act as charge-trapping sites. Gradual charge recombination followed by thermal detrapping produces hour-long emissions 4,5,6 . Inorganic LPL materials are insoluble in any solvent, and require grinding into microparticles before dispersion into solvents or polymers for practical applications. Most inorganic LPL systems require ultraviolet to blue excitation light below 450 nm due to the limited metal-oxide absorption bands 7,8,9 .Long-persistent luminescence (LPL) is a phenomenon in which emission continues for a long period after photoexcitation 1 .

        <p>Current OLPL systems require inert gas conditions to exhibit LPL because LPL is quenched completely in air. These OLPL systems, which consist of an electron-donating and electron-accepting material, store absorbed energy into geminate pairs of air-unstable donor radical cations and acceptor radical anions. A donor-acceptor mixed crystal has been reported to exhibit OLPL in air due to oxygen diffusion being suppressed by crystallization 19 , but crystalline systems cannot take advantage of OLPL material properties, such as flexibility and processability. Air-stable amorphous OLPL systems will enable applications that are unique to organic materials, such as solution process coating and flexible polymer films. For practical applications of OLPL systems, the air stability needs to be improved without crystallization.Current OLPL systems require inert gas conditions to exhibit LPL because LPL is quenched completely in air.

        <p>Radical anions (n-type organic semiconductors) are more unstable than radical cations (p-type organic semiconductors) in air. The reported OLPL system can be considered as an n-type OLPL system due to the low donor concentration where only electrons can diffuse through acceptor molecules (Fig. 1a). The unstable radical anions can be ascribed to the high probability of a reaction with oxygen. A p-type OLPL system, in which radical cations diffuse (Fig. 1a), is expected to be more stable to oxygen. Air-stable organic transistors have been achieved by making the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level deeper than the reduction potential of oxygen (-3.5 eV) 21,22 .

        <p>In this article we report p-type OLPL systems made from cationic electron acceptors as a dopant and neutral electron donors as a host. These systems exhibit LPL in air. The addition of hole-trapping materials improved the performance sevenfold under nitrogen gas without changing the emission spectrum. In addition, the p-type OLPL system can be excited by a wavelength from 300 to 600 nm. By tuning the energy gap between the electron donor and acceptor, near-infrared (NIR) LPL emission is achieved. The development of such visible-light-active p-type OLPL systems that work in air will contribute to various future practical applications of OLPL systems.

When the redox potential was out of range of electrochemical measurement, the HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the optical gap calculated from the absorption edge (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1).In this article we report p-type OLPL systems made from cationic electron acceptors as a dopant and neutral electron donors as a host.

        <p>When the films were excited by 365 nm light, the TPP + /TPBi, TPP + /mCBP and MeOTPP + /mCBP films exhibited a long LPL emission in which the decay profiles followed a power-law decay (Fig. 2a) 38,39 . Because of the strong electron-accepting properties of TPP + , the mixed film exhibited an appreciable CT absorption over 500 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1). This power-law emission decay indicates the generation of intermediate charge-separated states and successive gradual bulk charge recombination, which led to LPL. The emission spectra of these films were attributed to the CT excited states between the donors and acceptors 16,17 .When the films were excited by 365 nm light, the TPP + /TPBi, TPP + /mCBP and MeOTPP + /mCBP films exhibited a long LPL emission in which the decay profiles followed a power-law decay (Fig. 2a) 38,39 .

        <p>The TPP + /TPBi, TPP + /mCBP and MeOTPP + /mCBP films form 1 CT excited states (Fig. 2b) and the 1 CT energy levels are lower than those of the locally excited states of donors and acceptors ( 3 LED and 3 LEA). Therefore, the LPL that was caused by the recombination of accumulated charges occurs from the CT states. Because the ΦPL of the CT excited states is low, the non-radiative deactivation pathway from the CT excited state to the ground state is also available. The TPP + /TPBi film exhibits a CT emission at 603 nm with a shoulder peak at ∼555 nm. The shoulder peak decreased with an increase in TPP + concentration because of the self-absorption of TPP radicals at 500-600 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5a) 17,40,41 and disappeared at the higher TPP + concentration due to the strong self-absorption of the TPP radical (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The TPP + /TPBi film showed the longest LPL duration of 1,830 s.

        <p>The TPP + /mCBP film exhibited a broad NIR emission at 731 nm from the smaller energy gap between the TPP + LUMO and mCBP HOMO. Because of the low ΦPL of the CT emission and low NIR sensitivity of the photodiode for detection, the LPL duration was 33 s. The MeOTPP + /mCBP films exhibited a CT emission at 624 nm with an LPL duration of 610 s. In contrast, the MeOTPP + /TPBi film did not form a CT excited state although the HOMO and LUMO levels were appropriate. The TPBi may not act as a donor because of the closed HOMO levels between them. Instead, this film exhibited the fluorescence and RTP of the MeOTPP + (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results indicate that the formation of the lowest 1 CT state is important for efficient LPL emission in ptype OLPL systems.The TPP + /mCBP film exhibited a broad NIR emission at 731 nm from the smaller energy gap between the TPP + LUMO and mCBP HOMO.

The LPL emission was observed at all excitation wavelengths, although the LPL duration decreased, which correlates with the absorption intensity (Supplementary Figs. 2c and6c). Unlike the emission lifetime from normal excited states, such as conventional fluorescence and phosphorescence, the duration of the LPL depends on the number of stored charges and varies with the excitation wavelength.

        <p>The LPL performance improved sevenfold with addition of hole-trapping material to the p-type OLPL system. Previously, we reported that the LPL duration could be enhanced by doping electron-trapping materials into an n-type OLPL system 13 . The dopants can receive electrons from the acceptor molecules because the LUMO of the dopant is lower than that of the acceptor. By tuning the appropriate LUMO level, the trapped electrons remained for more than one week 45 . In the p-type OLPL system, TCTA was doped into the TPP + /TPBi system as the HOMO level of the TCTA (-5.3 eV) was shallower than that of the TPBi (-6.0 eV) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). The PL and LPL spectra of the TPP + /TPBi/TCTA film with a 1:99:1 molar ratio (Fig. 3a) was nearly identical to that of the TPP + /TPBi film (Fig. 2b), except that the LPL duration time was significantly improved almost sevenfold, to 14,600 s (Fig. 3b). The TPBi/TCTA (99:1) film also exhibited no LPL because of the closed LUMO levels between them, although it formed a CT excited state (Supplementary Fig. 8).

        <p>This peak corresponds to the radical cation of TCTA in dichloromethane (DCM) under electrochemical oxidation, although a wavelength shift can be observed because of the polarization effect in the solid film (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the TPBi/TCTA film exhibited no absorption of the TCTA radical cation after photoexcitation (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the formation of the TCTA radical cations in the TPP + /TPBi/TCTA film indicates a hole diffusion from a TPBi radical cation to a TCTA molecule. The hole trapping was confirmed by the temperature dependence of the LPL duration 46 . Because hole detrapping is endothermic, the LPL intensity increased by raising the temperature in the TPP + /TPBi/TCTA film (Supplementary Fig. 9b). In contrast, the LPL duration of the TPP + /TPBi film decreased gradually with an increase in temperature because the nonradiative process was enhanced at high temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Thus, detrapping in the TPP + /TPBi/TCTA film for the LPL intensity overwhelmed the nonradiative process at the measured temperatures.This peak corresponds to the radical cation of TCTA in dichloromethane (DCM) under electrochemical oxidation, although a wavelength shift can be observed because of the polarization effect in the solid film (Fig. 3d).

        <p>To confirm the generality of the hole-trapping mechanism, several trap molecules with different HOMO levels (PPT, mCBP and α-NPD) were investigated (Supplementary Fig. 10). While the LPL emission spectra were the same for all systems, the emission duration varied significantly. These differences mainly depend on the HOMO levels, suggesting the LPL emission originates from the hole diffusion mechanism. Since the HOMOs of PPT (-5.9 eV) and mCBP (-5.7 eV) are comparable to that of TPBi (-6.0 eV), they do not act as effective traps because the holes can easily detrap at room temperature.To confirm the generality of the hole-trapping mechanism, several trap molecules with different HOMO levels (PPT, mCBP and α-NPD) were investigated (Supplementary Fig. 10).

        <p>Optical analysis of TPP + /TPBi, MeOTPP + /mCBP and TPP + /TPBi/TCTA films was carried out in air to confirm the LPL emission of the p-type OLPL systems because the LUMO levels of the TPP + (-4.0 eV) and MeOTPP + (-3.8 eV) are lower than the reduction potential of oxygen (-3.5 eV). Although the reported n-type OLPL system of m-MTDATA/PPT showed no LPL emission in air (Supplementary Fig. 9a), all p-type OLPL films exhibited LPL in air (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 11b). However, the observed LPL durations of all films in air were shorter than in nitrogen because the energy transfer from the triplet excited state of the emitters to the molecular oxygen with a triplet ground state (triplet quenching) cannot be prevented 47 . An irreversible reaction between TPP radical and oxygen is known 48 ; however, this reaction is considered to be slow in the solid state because the LPL intensity recovers considerably with evacuation (Supplementary Fig. 12). On the other hand, because of the irreversible reaction with oxygen, the emission intensity does not recover completely. The charge recombination in LPL emission generates 1 CT and 3 CT excited states 49 , and the 3 CT excited states are quenched by oxygen. In contrast, the emission spectra did not change because of the lack of 3 LE contribution (Fig. 4c,d). In addition to oxygen, water also can deactivate the radicals. To confirm the LPL quenching by water, the crushed TPP + /TPBi/TCTA sample was dispersed into water and excited at 365 nm (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Video 1). As a result, LPL was also observed in water. Due to the slow diffusion of water into the solid samples, the effect of quenching by water is very small.Optical analysis of TPP + /TPBi, MeOTPP + /mCBP and TPP + /TPBi/TCTA films was carried out in air to confirm the LPL emission of the p-type OLPL systems because the LUMO levels of the TPP + (-4.0 eV) and MeOTPP + (-3.8 eV) are lower than the reduction potential of oxygen (-3.5 eV).

        <p>These results indicate that the p-type OLPL system with deep HOMO levels can emit LPL in air but cannot prevent triplet quenching by oxygen. Future developments of lowoxygen-diffusion hosts or advanced encapsulation techniques to prevent oxygen are required to obtain efficient LPL emissions in air.These results indicate that the p-type OLPL system with deep HOMO levels can emit LPL in air but cannot prevent triplet quenching by oxygen.

        <p>We demonstrated p-type OLPL systems based on the cationic organic photoredox catalyst TPP + and MeOTPP + as acceptors. These systems can be excited by a wavelength from the ultraviolet range to 600 nm and exhibit a yellow-to-NIR LPL emission. The ptype OLPL with deeper HOMO and LUMO levels can prevent reaction with oxygen and exhibited LPL in air. The hole-trapping dopant enhanced the LPL duration strongly without changing the emission spectrum. The tunable absorption wavelength from 300 to 600 nm of OLPL systems provides a major advantage over inorganic materials, and the absorptions and emissions that were fitted to the biological window are expected to have future bioimaging applications. For efficient charge separation, the oxidized state of the donor and the reduced state of the acceptor must be stable. For the hole-trapping mechanism, the electron donor, acceptor and trap molecules need to have a cascading HOMO and LUMO relationship. The hole-trapping material requires an energy gap of about 0.5 eV shallower than the acceptor's HOMO level for efficient hole trapping. For efficient LPL emission, the CT excited state needs to be lower than that of the 3 LE. For the melt-cast process, the donor host needs to form good amorphous films. The p-type OLPLs can prevent reaction with oxygen in the excited state, making it possible to produce LPL films by a simple solution processing. However, because triplet quenching by oxygen cannot be prevented perfectly in amorphous films, low-oxygen-diffusion hosts or oxygen barrier materials are required for future practical applications. Future development of p-type OLPL made by polymers will enable printable and flexible film OLPL systems.We demonstrated p-type OLPL systems based on the cationic organic photoredox catalyst TPP + and MeOTPP + as acceptors.

        <p>Photoluminescence lifetime was measured using a streak camera system (C14832-110, Hamamatsu Photonics). Samples were photoexcited by 343-nm femtosecond (pulse width 190 fs, 1 kHz) laser (Pharos and HERO, Light Conversion). The phosphorescence lifetime of TPP + and MeOTPP + was obtained by time-resolved emission spectra at 77 K measured by spectrometers (PMA-12, Hamamatsu Photonics). Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were carried out using an electrochemical analyser (Model 610, BAS). Measurements were performed in dried and oxygen-free DMF or THF using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting electrolyte. A platinum wire was used as a counter electrode, with glassy carbon as a working electrode, and Ag/Ag + as a reference electrode. Redox potentials were referenced against ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc + ). Corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies were calculated from first reduction or oxidation peaks using an absolute value of -4.8 eV to vacuum for the Fc/Fc + redox potential 49 . The absorption spectra of the TPP + , TCTA and α-NPD radical species were measured by the in situ UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical technique. The UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer is UV-3600 Plus, SHIMADZU. TPP + , TCTA, and α-NPD radical cations were generated by electrical oxidation on the platinum mesh electrode surface in a DCM solution that contained 0.1 M TBAPF6 (BAE, 013510 SEC-C, Thin layer quartz glass spectroelectrochemical cell kit) using an electrochemical analyzer (BAS, Model 610E).
