        <p>Protective humoral immune responses require the formation of a functional antibody repertoire by B cells within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) such as the spleen, peripheral lymph nodes and tonsils.Protective humoral immune responses require the formation of a functional antibody repertoire by B cells within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) such as the spleen, peripheral lymph nodes and tonsils.</p>
        <p>After antigen encounter, activated B cells either differentiate into short-lived plasma cells or following cognate interaction with antigen-specific T cells can form germinal centres (GCs) (1). GCs are transient structures where B cells undergo iterative cycles of clonal expansion and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable regions of their immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light chain genes followed by affinitybased selection of antigen-specific clones. This dynamic process occurs in spatially distinct dark and light zones (DZ and LZ) under the regulation of a network of specialised T follicular helper cells, follicular dendritic cells and macrophages (2).After antigen encounter, activated B cells either differentiate into short-lived plasma cells or following cognate interaction with antigen-specific T cells can form germinal centres (GCs) (1).

        <p>B cells differentiate and exit the GC either as antibody-secreting plasmablasts committed to the plasma cell lineage or memory B cells (MBC), which are long-lived quiescent cells capable of being reactivated upon antigen re-exposure (3). Antibody effector functions are broadly determined by their isotype, which is specified by the constant domain genes in the IgH locus. During maturation B cells may undergo class switch recombination (CSR), which involves deletional recombination of IgM and IgD constant domain genes and expression of a different downstream constant domain gene (IgG1-4, IgA1-2, IgE) (4). Specific hierarchies in isotype switching patterns have been reported in peripheral blood (5).B cells differentiate and exit the GC either as antibody-secreting plasmablasts committed to the plasma cell lineage or memory B cells (MBC), which are long-lived quiescent cells capable of being reactivated upon antigen re-exposure (3).

        <p>Antibody repertoires and B cell-mediated immunity are therefore shaped by the combined influences of cell fate decisions, affinity maturation and CSR. B cells express their antibody immunoglobulin genes as part of a membrane-bound complex termed the B cell receptor (BCR). During maturation in GCs, antigen-binding and downstream signalling of the BCR is a primary determinant of B cell survival and differentiation (6,7). BCR activation thresholds and downstream signalling can differ due to isotype-specific differences in extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of immunoglobulin proteins forming the BCR (8)(9)(10). Thus, as well as shaping the effector functions of subsequent antibody repertoires, CSR may influence B cell survival or fate specification during affinity maturation. However, deconvolution of SHM, class switching and diverse cell states in the polyclonal context of human SLOs in vivo has proved a challenge (2).Antibody repertoires and B cell-mediated immunity are therefore shaped by the combined influences of cell fate decisions, affinity maturation and CSR.

        <p>To improve our understanding of the cellular, transcriptional and antibody repertoire dynamics during human B cell maturation in vivo, we performed unbiased single-cell transcriptomic and repertoire profiling of a widely studied model SLO, the human tonsil (https://www.tonsilimmune.org/). These integrated bulk and single-cell antibody repertoires paired with single-cell transcriptomics allowed us to define transcriptional B cell states, including a detailed exploration of MBC heterogeneity, reconstruct temporal gene expression dynamics and resolve unique functional capabilities of GC and MBCs linked to antibody class switching. This roadmap of human B cell maturation provides unprecedented resolution of the formation of B cell-mediated immunity and is a unique resource to study both normal and pathological B cell responses.To improve our understanding of the cellular, transcriptional and antibody repertoire dynamics during human B cell maturation in vivo, we performed unbiased single-cell transcriptomic and repertoire profiling of a widely studied model SLO, the human tonsil (https://www.tonsilimmune.org/).

        <p>The majority of high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing studies in human have examined peripheral blood B cell subsets, which significantly differ to dynamic repertoires in active SLOs. To provide a subclass-specific and quantitative analysis of the antibody repertoire landscape in human tonsils, we sequenced the antibody repertoires of four broadly defined tonsillar B cell subsets; naïve, GC, memory and plasmablasts using a unique molecular identifier-indexed protocol (Fig1A) (5). We analysed tonsillar B cells from both recurrent tonsillectomy and obstructive sleep apnoea patients and found good agreement between bulk FACS-sorted B cell repertoires and donor-matched unsorted single-cell antibody repertoires (FigS1, Fig2). As expected, naïve B cell repertoires were predominantly unswitched and unmutated. GC and MBCs comprised both switched and unswitched IgH sequences with elevated SHM and plasmablasts were nearly all switched and highly mutated (Fig1B-C).The majority of high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing studies in human have examined peripheral blood B cell subsets, which significantly differ to dynamic repertoires in active SLOs.

        <p>Higher IgH SHM frequencies within the GC typically reflect higher affinity BCRs and are proposed to bias GC B cells towards the plasmablast rather than the MBC fate (11,12). In keeping with this, plasmablast-derived repertoires in tonsil generally contained higher SHM frequencies than those of MBCs (Fig1C). However, by resolving for antibody subclass, we found that SHM levels were broadly similar between different mature B cell subsets, with the exception of IgD and increased in frequency along the immunoglobulin locus (Fig1D). Comparison of the clonal diversity of subclass-specific MBCs and plasmablasts revealed unswitched and IgA + MBCs were less clonally expanded (as evidenced by higher diversity) than plasmablasts of the same isotype, while IgG + MBCs and plasmablasts appeared to have clonally expanded to similar degrees (Fig1E). This is not likely explained by differences in SHM frequencies (Fig1D), but may reflect differences in their selection or cell fate specification linked with the outcome of CSR. Indeed, when we examined antibody subclass frequencies in these broadly defined B cell populations we found that as well as an increased propensity to retain IgM expression (Fig1B), MBCs were 3.3-or 7.3-fold more likely than plasmablasts to express IgA1 or IgA2 respectively, while plasmablasts were more likely to express IgG1 (Fig1F). Intriguingly, these enrichments were linked with specific B cell fates even for expanded clones spanning different subsets (Fig1G, FigS2).Higher IgH SHM frequencies within the GC typically reflect higher affinity BCRs and are proposed to bias GC B cells towards the plasmablast rather than the MBC fate (11,12).

        <p>To explore how these subset-specific class switching patterns might arise, we reconstructed phylogenies for 28,845 expanded clones and calculated the likelihood that specific CSR events had occurred between closely related B cells compared to that expected by chance (Fig1H), similar to analyses performed in peripheral blood B cells (5). MBC clonal lineages exhibited greater likelihoods for switching of isotype pairs closely located in linear space along the IgH locus, compared to plasmablast clones which demonstrated a more eclectic pattern of isotype switching (Fig1H). Of note, both the antibody subclass frequencies and reconstructed class switch hierarchies of MBCs closely resembled those of GC cells, consistent with models that propose a stochastic exit of MBCs from the GC (13,14), in contrast to active selection of the plasma cell fate. Together, these analyses provide evidence that antibody-based selection mechanisms differ for two major B cell fates and that this appears related to the outcomes of CSR earlier in maturation.To explore how these subset-specific class switching patterns might arise, we reconstructed phylogenies for 28,845 expanded clones and calculated the likelihood that specific CSR events had occurred between closely related B cells compared to that expected by chance (Fig1H), similar to analyses performed in peripheral blood B cells (5).

        <p>FACS-based strategies to study dynamic cell processes in human tissues may miss rare or unknown cell populations. Therefore, in parallel to our bulk antibody repertoires (Fig1), we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) paired with single-cell immunoglobulin VDJ sequencing (scVDJ-seq) for unsorted tonsillar immune cells from the same samples (Fig2A-B). After stringent quality control, we retained the transcriptomes of 32,607 cells (n=7; median of 3142 and mean of 4658 cells per donor) from which we identified 30 distinct cell populations (Fig2C-D, TableS1). Although our primary focus was understanding B cell maturation, we annotated 11 T cell and 7 non-lymphoid populations (Fig2C, S3A-D, TableS2-3) as a valuable resource to study these cells. Importantly, we did not identify any populations unique to recurrent tonsillitis or obstructive sleep apnoea patients (FigS3E).FACS-based strategies to study dynamic cell processes in human tissues may miss rare or unknown cell populations.

        <p>Tonsils are a model SLO capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity. We found that major tonsillar immune cell states were broadly conserved in other SLOs such as lymph nodes and spleen (FigS4), similar to other analyses (15), although we observed enrichment of GC-associated cell states in paediatric tonsils that likely reflect differences in donor ages (FigS4B-D). We also observed differences in antibody features (FigS4E-F) that may reflect tissue-specific difference in local cytokine environments. The broad conservation of cell states across different SLOs supports the use of tonsils as a model system to study systemic immunity and highlights the importance of profiling immunologically-active tissues to understand GC-dependent B cell maturation.Tonsils are a model SLO capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity.

        <p>We next examined B cell states within our single-cell transcriptomic atlas. To improve the power and accuracy of our single-cell antibody repertoire analyses, we integrated single-cell and bulk repertoires for each donor (Fig2E). We identified 12 distinct B cell populations based on unbiased clustering of gene expression (Fig2F, S5, Table S4) and quantified their antibody isotype frequencies (Fig2G, S6A), SHM levels (Fig2H, S6B), clonal diversity (Fig2I-J) and relationships with other B cell subsets (Fig2K-L). All populations were reproducibly observed across patients, regardless of tonsillitis history (Fig2M, S3E). We identified all major stages of B cell maturation in human tonsils, including naïve, activated, GC (including both LZ and non-proliferating DZ cells), MBCs, tissue-resident FCRL4 + MBCs, plasmablasts and a cycling population consisting mostly of DZ GC cells (Fig2H). We also annotated a class-switched, hypermutated and clonally-expanded GC B cell subset expressing plasmablast-specific transcription factors (PRDM1, XBP1) (Fig2F-J, S5), consistent with a pre-plasmablast (prePB) population reported recently in tonsillar GC B cells (FigS5C) (16). We found that prePB GC cells uniquely expressed several interesting gene markers, including signalling molecules like FRZB and BTNL9 (Fig2F, S5A), although the functional relevance of this is unknown.We next examined B cell states within our single-cell transcriptomic atlas.

        <p>Our unbiased analysis of B cell states revealed two additional populations of particular interest. First, we define a naïve "preGC" B cell state expressing unmutated IgM and IgD that transcriptionally share markers with both naïve and LZ GC populations (FigS5A-B), but have yet to acquire features consistent with B cell maturation in the GC such as CD27 and CD38 expression, hypermutated antibody genes or clonal expansion (Fig2F-J, S5B). Flow cytometry of several marker genes expressed by these cells (CD23 (FCER2), CD108 (SEMA7A) and CD58) confirmed the enrichment of a similar state in naïve B cell populations (FigS7). Secondly, we discover a transcriptionally distinct and clonally-expanded IgM + B cell population in the GC with elevated expression of genes associated with inhibitory BCR signalling, such as FCRL3, FCRL2, SAMSN1, and SIGLEC10 (Fig2D,F-J), that we refer to as FCRL3 high GC B cells. While these cells also expressed high levels of the proposed pre-MBC marker CCR6 (12), they typically had inconsistent expression of other recently defined pre-MBC markers (FigS5C) (16). As this cluster of unswitched cells was defined by very high FCRL2 and FCRL3 expression (Fig3F), we examined these markers by flow cytometry of tonsillar B cells and found a strong relationship between surface expression of FCRL3, but not FCRL2, and IgM expression in both GC and MBC populations (FigS8A-F). We also identified a rare population of FCRL3 high GC B cells by immunohistochemistry (FigS8G-H). Although the precise ontology of these cells remains unclear, scVDJ-based analyses found that FCRL3 high GC B cells are part of highly expanded GC-derived clones that contain both MBCs or plasmablasts (Fig2K-L, FigS9), indicating that they arise through productive GC reactions and are unlikely to be derived from a separate or committed lineage.Our unbiased analysis of B cell states revealed two additional populations of particular interest.

        <p>During activation, B cells acquire antigen, either in soluble form or displayed on the surface of follicular antigen-presenting cells (APCs), allowing them to migrate to the T cell zone where they can participate in GC reactions. We reasoned that our single-cell atlas of B cell maturation would contain a full spectrum of activation states and allow us to reconstruct temporal gene expression and antibody repertoire dynamics during B cell activation and formation of the GC response. Our scRNA-seq analysis identified a B cell cluster composed of both antigen-inexperienced naïve B cells and antigen-experienced MBCs (FigS10) that had elevated expression of activation marker genes (Fig3A) and high frequency of predicted cell-cell interactions with APCs (Fig3B). This activated B cell state appeared capable of communicating with both APCs and T cells through ICAM1-ITGAL1 (LFA-1) and/or IL6, respectively (Fig3C). Many of these predicted cell-cell interactions were also detected in preGC and LZ GC B cell states (Fig3C) before being lost in other GC B cell populations, suggesting that preGC B cells might exist as a transitional state between initial B cell activation and GC formation.During activation, B cells acquire antigen, either in soluble form or displayed on the surface of follicular antigen-presenting cells (APCs), allowing them to migrate to the T cell zone where they can participate in GC reactions.

        <p>To better understand the transcriptional dynamics of different B cell populations, particularly the preGC B cell state, we performed RNA velocity analysis (17,18) to model transcriptional kinetics of individual B cells and infer their directionality and relationship with other B cell populations. This confirmed that preGC cells exhibit a strong directionality towards the LZ GC state (Fig3D), fitting with their transcriptional relatedness (FigS5A) and independent partition-based graph analysis (FigS11).To better understand the transcriptional dynamics of different B cell populations, particularly the preGC B cell state, we performed RNA velocity analysis (17,18) to model transcriptional kinetics of individual B cells and infer their directionality and relationship with other B cell populations.

        <p>Velocity-based pseudotemporal ordering of naïve, activated, preGC and LZ GC B cells placed preGC cells between activated and LZ GC B cells and revealed the full continuum of gene expression from early activation events to bona fide GC B cells (Fig3E-F). This included the dynamic expression of key signalling molecules and transcription factors such as CD40, EBI3, MIF, BATF, BHLHE40 and MYC (FigS12A). Crucially, we found that the activated B cell cluster (including both activated naïve and MBC sub-populations) (FigS10) placed early in the trajectory and were enriched for an experimentallyderived gene signature associated with acute (1hr) B cell stimulation, while preGC B cells more closely resembled intermediate level B cell stimulation (3-6hr) (Fig3G) (19). This confirms that these B cells represent a secondary activation state following antigen encounter and before formation of GCs. Our reconstruction of B cell activation therefore provides a valuable framework to study these dynamic B cell states in vivo.Velocity-based pseudotemporal ordering of naïve, activated, preGC and LZ GC B cells placed preGC cells between activated and LZ GC B cells and revealed the full continuum of gene expression from early activation events to bona fide GC B cells (Fig3E-F).

        <p>While it was long held that CSR occurs exclusively within the GC, several studies in mice have demonstrated that CSR can occur prior to the GC response (20)(21)(22). However, the precise B cell state in which this occurs has proved elusive in humans. Our reconstruction of in vivo human B cell activation revealed a surprising enrichment of genes associated with CSR in preGC B cells (Fig3H-J), with similar or higher enrichment compared to LZ GC B cells which are canonically the site of CSR. One notable example was APEX1/APE1 which is required for CSR and was expressed mostly by non-GC B cells, with the exception of a small number of GC B cells (22) (FigS12B). Although expression levels of AICDA were low (Fig2H), our analysis of the preGC and LZ GC transition revealed other genes mechanistically linked with CSR (23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28), including those capable of binding switch region sequences within the IgH locus, interacting with CSR machinery or regulating AICDA/AICDA stability (Fig3K). Other genes of interest included miR155HG and transcription factors BATF and IRF4, known B cell-intrinsic regulators of GC formation in mice (29)(30)(31) and the poorly understood transcription factor BHLHE40 that is capable of binding to the major regulatory regions at the IgH locus (FigS13). Although we observed very few switched preGC B cells (Fig2G,3L) and did not observe any preGC B cells concurrently expressing multiple isotypes with identical VDJ sequences based on analysis of high-confidence scVDJ sequences, we found that expression of IgH germline transcripts (GLTs), which is essential for CSR to take place at the IgH locus, peaks in preGC cells (Fig3M). We could also detect some coding IGHG scRNA-seq expression in unswitched preGC B cells (FigS12C), although this appeared to be at too low a level in single cells to enable reconstruction of high-quality scVDJ contigs. Intriguingly, these observations in human tonsil are consistent with GLT transcription peaking and CSR occurring prior to GC formation in mouse models (22). This suggests the possibility that the preGC B cell state may be primed to undergo CSR before formation of the GC response, although our observations do not preclude CSR occurring within the GC as well.While it was long held that CSR occurs exclusively within the GC, several studies in mice have demonstrated that CSR can occur prior to the GC response (20)(21)(22).

        <p>CSR has the potential to influence the antibody-based selection of B cells within GC reactions as a consequence of differential signalling through the membrane-bound immunoglobulin BCR, but studying these dynamics is challenging in vivo.

        <p>Although GC B cells cycle between physically distinct light and dark zones we found that many GC B cells exist in a continuum between these two states (Fig4A-B), similar to previous studies (16,32), except for FCRL3 high and prePB cells that are transcriptionally distinct (Fig2F, 4C). These subpopulations of GC B cells also exhibit different class switching patterns, with prePB cells more frequently expressing class-switched isotypes and FCRL3 high GC cells retaining expression of IgM/IgD (Fig2G, 4D, S8). Intriguingly, expanded B cell clones containing FCRL3 high GC cells were almost exclusively IgM + (Fig4E, FigS9), suggesting that antibody class may be linked with a specific gene expression program and cell fate, or vice versa.Although GC B cells cycle between physically distinct light and dark zones we found that many GC B cells exist in a continuum between these two states (Fig4A-B), similar to previous studies (16,32), except for FCRL3 high and prePB cells that are transcriptionally distinct (Fig2F, 4C).

        <p>We next leveraged our paired single-cell VDJ and transcriptomic datasets to stratify all non-cycling GC B cells (and excluding prePB and FCRL3 high populations) based on their antibody SHM frequencies as a proxy for affinity (Fig4F). GC B cells with high SHM were significantly enriched with gene signatures of high affinity antigen-binding B cells (11), higher expression of the B cell maturation marker CD27 and larger clone sizes (Fig4F), reflecting increased expansion and maturation based on BCR affinity. We detected very few B cells expressing non-functional IgH sequences (Fig4F) and apoptotic cells failed to generate sufficiently high quality transcriptomic data or were removed due to elevated mitochondrial content. GC B cells with high or low SHM had many differences in gene expression (Fig4G, TableS5), consistent with high and low affinity binding events differentially regulating GC B cells (11). However, these SHM gene signatures were very similar to gene signatures for switched or unswitched GC B cells (Fig4G, TableS6), as predicted given lower average SHM frequencies of IgM + GC B cells (Fig1D).We next leveraged our paired single-cell VDJ and transcriptomic datasets to stratify all non-cycling GC B cells (and excluding prePB and FCRL3 high populations) based on their antibody SHM frequencies as a proxy for affinity (Fig4F).

        <p>To overcome the confounding influence of maturation state on examining isotype-specific gene expression, we compared GC B cells with matched SHM levels expressing different antibody classes. This revealed that switched GC B cells were enriched for genes required for cell survival, BCR signalling, antigen presentation, immune responses and metabolism, as well as other important signalling pathways (Fig4H-I, TableS7). Switched GC B cells also had evidence of increased signalling in response to T cell-derived cytokines such as IL4, TGFβ, IFNγ and CD40LG, or signalling through different toll-like receptors (TLR) (Fig4H), consistent with them receiving more T cell help.To overcome the confounding influence of maturation state on examining isotype-specific gene expression, we compared GC B cells with matched SHM levels expressing different antibody classes.

        <p>Several genes involved with GC confinement or B cell niche homing were up-regulated in IgG + and IgA + GC B cells, such as genes required for CXCL12-mediated migration to GCs (LCP1, MYO1E) (33,34) and GC confinement receptor P2RY8 (35), indicating that switched B cells may be more likely to remain in the GC for longer. This could explain their higher rates of SHM. Most gene expression differences were comparable between IgG + and IgA + B cells (Fig4I, S14) and we identified few significant or meaningful differences for subclass-specific B cells (FigS14, TableS8). One interesting exception was the specific expression of CLEC16A in IgA + GC B cells given that this gene is associated with a selective IgA immunodeficiency (36). Finally, we observed many differences in the expression of transcription factors between class-specific GC B cells (Fig4I). IgG + B cells expressed higher levels of BCL6, XBP1 and ID3 that may increase their ability to reside in the GC or differentiate to plasma cells, while IgM + cells had higher levels of BACH2 that represses plasma cell differentiation (11,(37)(38)(39). We also found differential expression of other factors (LMO2, TOX, BCL11A, CUX1), raising the question of their role in the unique transcriptional wiring of switched and unswitched B cells within the GC.Several genes involved with GC confinement or B cell niche homing were up-regulated in IgG + and IgA + GC B cells, such as genes required for CXCL12-mediated migration to GCs (LCP1, MYO1E) (33,34) and GC confinement receptor P2RY8 (35), indicating that switched B cells may be more likely to remain in the GC for longer.

        <p>Our single-cell resolution of the GC response allowed us to uncouple antibody affinity and class and dissect differential contributions of these two critical arms of the B cell repertoire in shaping B cell fate and function in the GC. These analyses suggest varying abilities of switched and unswitched B cells to survive and reside in the GC and establish that in addition to BCR affinity, antibody-based selection in the GC can be shaped by whether a B cell has undergone CSR.Our single-cell resolution of the GC response allowed us to uncouple antibody affinity and class and dissect differential contributions of these two critical arms of the B cell repertoire in shaping B cell fate and function in the GC.

        <p>Maturation state and antibody class were linked to specific gene expression by GC B cells, potentially through membrane-specific isoforms of immunoglobulin as part of the BCR. In contrast to plasmablasts, MBCs retain BCR expression of which the isotype may influence the phenotypic properties of different MBC subsets (40), the full diversity of which remains unknown. We therefore sought to better define the heterogeneity within the MBC pool in human tonsils and determine whether antibody class expression by MBCs might be linked with different functional abilities or subsets.Maturation state and antibody class were linked to specific gene expression by GC B cells, potentially through membrane-specific isoforms of immunoglobulin as part of the BCR.

        <p>A significant proportion of MBCs in paediatric human tonsils are unswitched (Fig1B, 2G). To examine potential differential gene expression across class-switched MBC subsets we generated paired singlecell transcriptomics and VDJ repertoires for all (n=2) or IgM-depleted (n=4) MBCs (Table S1). Dataset integration and quality control provided 21,595 high-quality MBC single-cell transcriptomes that we annotated with 11 clusters reflecting different MBC subsets and states (Fig5A-C), all of which lacked marker gene expression for naïve or GC B cells (FigS15A). In addition to tissue-resident FCRL4 + MBCs previously identified (Fig2) (41), we annotated two rare CR2/CD21 low MBC subsets that appeared to resemble atypical MBC populations described in varied tissues and disease states (42-44) (Fig5A-C, S15B). The CD21 low 2 cluster shared several features with atypical FCRL5 high MBCs (44), such as high expression of inhibitory receptors (CD22) and genes involved in antigen presentation (CIITA) (Fig5C).A significant proportion of MBCs in paediatric human tonsils are unswitched (Fig1B, 2G).

        <p>Otherwise, the majority of MBC diversity within human tonsils reflected differences in cellular state or activity rather than distinct cell types, such as heat shock protein (HSP)-related and IFN-related gene activity (Fig5A-C, S15C). We also identified multiple activation states (Activated1/2), including MBCs with similar gene expression to naïve preGC cells and an enrichment for CSR genes (Fig5C, S15D-E), that we label as preGC MBCs. We also identified an FCRL3 high MBC state similar to the FCRL3 high GC population (Fig5C, S15D) and similar MBC populations could also be detected in lymph nodes and spleen, albeit at varying frequencies (FigS15F). This suggests that these annotated MBC populations may be widely shared functional states spanning multiple B cell fates and organ systems.Otherwise, the majority of MBC diversity within human tonsils reflected differences in cellular state or activity rather than distinct cell types, such as heat shock protein (HSP)-related and IFN-related gene activity (Fig5A-C, S15C).

        <p>We next examined whether class-switched and unswitched MBCs exhibit different gene expression networks that might reflect unique functional abilities (45). We found little evidence that antibody class contributed towards the likelihood of an MBC to exist in a given state, with the exception of FCRL3 high MBCs which, similar to FCRL3 high GC cells, were predominantly IgM + by both scVDJ and flow cytometry analysis (Fig5A-B, S8, S16A). Intriguingly, an FCRL3 high MBC gene signature was enriched in IgM + cells across all MBC clusters (FigS16B), further supporting a close relationship between IgM expression and this cell state.We next examined whether class-switched and unswitched MBCs exhibit different gene expression networks that might reflect unique functional abilities (45).

        <p>Comparison of switched and unswitched MBCs with equivalent SHM levels, as MBCs expressing switched isotypes tend to have higher SHM frequencies (FigS16C), confirmed widespread gene expression differences that were independent of MBC subset or state (Fig5D-F). This indicates a specific transcriptional wiring of MBCs dependent upon their antibody class. Unswitched MBCs were broadly enriched for genes involved in cytokine-mediated signalling, activation, antigen presentation and migration (Fig5E-F), which may reflect the increased capacity of IgM + MBCs to re-initiate GC reactions as part of a recall memory response (45)(46)(47), an essential component of long-term B cellmediated immunity. Counterintuitively, IgM + MBCs were also enriched for anti-proliferative and apoptotic gene pathways (Fig5E), as well as many genes proposed to regulate or inhibit B cell activation, such as FCRLA, FCRL2, FCRL3, CBLB, CD72 and SIGLEC10 (48)(49)(50)(51)(52). This suggests a fine regulatory balance at the transcriptional level may control the activation threshold of unswitched MBCs.Comparison of switched and unswitched MBCs with equivalent SHM levels, as MBCs expressing switched isotypes tend to have higher SHM frequencies (FigS16C), confirmed widespread gene expression differences that were independent of MBC subset or state (Fig5D-F).

        <p>Unswitched MBCs expressed higher levels of POU2F2 (OCT2) and FOXP1 than class-switched MBCs (Fig5F), which coordinate the capacity of B cells to respond normally to antigen receptor signals and directly repress key regulators of plasma cell differentiation respectively (53,54). This is consistent with switched IgG + MBCs being more likely to differentiate into plasma cells, while unswitched IgM + MBCs are more likely to re-enter or form secondary GC responses to gain higher affinity (45)(46)(47). Indeed, unswitched MBCs in the preGC cluster were significantly enriched for gene signatures linked with GC entry and CSR compared to switched MBCs in the same cluster (Fig5G-H). This supports a model where unswitched MBCs are more likely to form secondary GC responses than switched MBCs, and that these unswitched MBCs are primed to undergo class switching during this process.Unswitched MBCs expressed higher levels of POU2F2 (OCT2) and FOXP1 than class-switched MBCs (Fig5F), which coordinate the capacity of B cells to respond normally to antigen receptor signals and directly repress key regulators of plasma cell differentiation respectively (53,54).

        <p>High affinity antibodies are generated in SLOs, but the dynamic nature of this response has presented significant challenges to understanding human B cell-mediated immunity in vivo. By combining bulk antibody repertoire analysis with single-cell transcriptomics we have generated a detailed resource of human B cell maturation and the GC reaction. This enabled us to explore diverse B cell states, reconstruct B cell activation dynamics, dissect the relationship between antibody class and functional capability of GC and MBC subsets, and reveal an unappreciated heterogeneity in tonsillar MBC population. These integrated analyses highlight how the outcome of CSR can influence B cell fate and function, and provide a detailed framework through which to view B cell-mediated immune responses.High affinity antibodies are generated in SLOs, but the dynamic nature of this response has presented significant challenges to understanding human B cell-mediated immunity in vivo.

        <p>The humoral immune response exhibits compartmentalisation that divides the gut-associated lymphoid tissue from blood-rich tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and lung (55). Tonsils are positioned in the upper airway and are highly exposed to antigen relative to encapsulated lymph nodes. Memory responses generated in tonsillar GCs seed the airway mucosa (56). Tonsils therefore form an important component of both systemic and mucosal immunity. Apart from known tonsillar-specific B cell populations such as tissue-resident FCRL4 + MBC and IgD + plasma cells (Fig2, S4), we found that B cell populations in the human tonsil are transcriptionally highly similar to those in lymph nodes, although we cannot exclude the possibility that functional differences or unique populations may exist between tissues. Nonetheless, tonsils provide a useful and largely representative model for studying the dynamic GC responses of SLOs. Although first histologically observed over a century ago, many questions remain about how B cells enter, experience and exit the GC reaction (1,2,7). Understanding the early events that facilitate GC entry by human B cells could provide new targets for adjuvants during vaccination or other immunotherapies. We mapped gene expression dynamics of the early stages of B cell activation that correspond to antigen-dependent signalling through the BCR and the subsequent transition to a transcriptionally-distinct preGC state, the latter of which is presumably under the regulation of cognate antigen-specific T helper cells. Recent spatial mapping of this specific preGC B cell state in the human lymph node has predicted that these cells are distinct from existing GCs (15), suggesting that they are likely forming new GC structures. This preGC state has many features suggesting it is primed to undergo class switching (Fig3), although we were not able to directly detect switch events themselves possibly due to the rarity of this occurrence. Alternatively, CSR may be linked with a rapid change from preGC to the LZ GC transcriptional state that is very dynamic and difficult to observe. Nonetheless, this B cell state appears to agree with observations in mouse models that B cells can undergo class switching before formation of GCs (20)(21)(22). If class switching is indeed capable of occurring before GC formation, this could then shape antibody-based selection dynamics in the GC (Fig4).The humoral immune response exhibits compartmentalisation that divides the gut-associated lymphoid tissue from blood-rich tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and lung (55).

        <p>Within the GC, B cell survival and selection is dependent on antigen binding to the BCR and its downstream signalling pathways (6). By using single-cell transcriptomics paired with BCR sequence analysis we uncouple antibody class, SHM frequency and B cell phenotype. We show that switched GC B cells, in contrast to IgM + cells, have gene expression patterns consistent with increased BCR signalling and a greater capacity to remain within the GC and acquire T cell help to undergo additional SHM and increase their affinity. If CSR does indeed occur prior to GC entry, as we and others suggest (20)(21)(22), these data support that the ability of a B cell to acquire high affinity is dictated by the outcome of a specific CSR "checkpoint" at the preGC stage. This would explain our observation that isotypematched MBCs have comparable SHM frequencies to plasmablasts, in contrast to the prevailing paradigm that higher affinity GC B cells preferentially differentiate towards the plasmablast fate whereas lower affinity clones seed the memory compartment (3,11,57). While we were not able to directly quantify antigen-specificity or antibody affinity given the highly polyclonal nature of tonsillar B cells, a recent study in mice found comparable antibody affinities between antigen-specific MBC and plasmablasts following influenza infection (58). The differences in affinity between these populations may instead be explained by the likelihood of whether they retained IgM expression prior to entering affinity maturation in the GC. This is also relevant during the secondary activation of MBCs, as IgM + MBCs appear more primed for CSR and GC entry, which may be important to provide a higher affinity secondary response. Finally, our discovery of a specific unswitched gene expression signature across different B cell states, exemplified by the FCRL3 high B cell state, raises interesting questions about how this unique transcriptional wiring is regulated and how it may contribute to their function. It will also be of interest to determine the relevance of the distinct lack of class switching across FCRL3 high containing clones, for example whether they arise as a consequence of prolonged antigen exposure and/or in response to particular antigens.Within the GC, B cell survival and selection is dependent on antigen binding to the BCR and its downstream signalling pathways (6).

        <p>Although the direct mechanisms shaping the class-specific gene expression differences remain to be elucidated, variations in the immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT), linker flexibility or glycosylation sites between IgM and other antibody isotypes may all contribute to differential BCR signalling (8)(9)(10). The enhanced BCR signalling capacity conferred by the ITT has been linked to the propensity of IgG+ memory B cells to differentiate into plasmablasts (46). Indeed, memory B cells were more enriched for IgA (which lacks an ITT) than PBs, although those IgA MBC clones were less clonally expanded than comparable PB clones. Although our study lacks spatial information about these different B cell populations, it is interesting to speculate that these repertoire-based differences between MBC and PBs might be linked to different spatial locations within tonsillar tissue that could be under greater or less influence of mucosal cytokines that drive IgA class switching. A limitation of our study, like others in human subjects, was that we could not compare multiple tissues in the same individual. We observed differences in isotype frequencies and SHM in tonsil compared to mesenteric lymph nodes which may relate to how different tissue environments shape the local antibody repertoire (e.g. pathogen exposure and cytokine production), but could also represent enrichment of antigen-experienced cells due to the relatively advanced age of lymph node patient donors. Of note, despite differences in the relative frequencies and clonal diversities of IgA and IgG in MBC versus plasmablasts in tonsillar repertoires, we did not identify many differences in gene expression between IgG + and IgA + B cells, or between subclass-specific B cells, which may reflect the need to increase the power of future studies to identify potentially subtle gene expression differences between the less abundant isotypes. While human tonsils are a useful tissue with which to examine active GC responses, it will be of interest to compare and contrast the class-specific gene expression differences we observe with those that might exist in other tissues in both health and disease to investigate how the local cellular and cytokine environment under the influence of different patterns of microbial exposure can influence antibody-based selection in different contexts or diseases states.Although the direct mechanisms shaping the class-specific gene expression differences remain to be elucidated, variations in the immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT), linker flexibility or glycosylation sites between IgM and other antibody isotypes may all contribute to differential BCR signalling (8)(9)(10).

        <p>Finally, our profiling of human tonsillar MBCs revealed diverse states reflecting different activation, signalling and functional potential. The upstream regulators of these different transcriptional states remains unclear from our analyses, but these unique gene expression patterns are likely to reflect the combined influence of extrinsic microenvironmental cues and cell intrinsic identity. We found that switched MBCs expressed genes consistent with being primed to undergo plasma cell differentiation whereas the more abundant unswitched MBC exhibited gene expression making them more likely to re-enter GC reactions. Given an emerging appreciation for heterogeneity within both human and mouse MBC populations (14) and building on evidence for functionally distinct MBC populations enriched for different FCRL expression patterns (41,44), some of which we observe here, our single-cell characterisation of different MBC populations and activation states provides a valuable dataset to interrogate the potential relevance for such diverse populations in mediating humoral immunity and immune-related disorders.Finally, our profiling of human tonsillar MBCs revealed diverse states reflecting different activation, signalling and functional potential.

Bulk and single-cell antibody repertoires were analysed together to examine subset-specific features of antibody repertoires and increase the power to identify clonally-related B cells in the single-cell VDJ-seq assay. Immune cell populations were identified by the unbiased clustering of scRNA-seq datasets and annotation with known and novel gene expression markers and antibody repertoire features for B cell subsets. Novel populations were examined further by flow cytometry. Pseudotemporal ordering was performed to examine the relationship between different B cell maturation stages. To test the hypothesis that antibody class is linked with B cell fate and function, we compared single-cell transcriptomes of antibody class-specific B cells with matched somatic hypermutation frequencies (as a proxy for affinity) and performed differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses.This study aimed to characterise antibody repertoires of human tonsillar B cell states with bulk antibody repertoire sequencing of sorted B cell populations combined with an unbiased characterisation of the gene expression and repertoires using single-cell transcriptomics and VDJ sequencing.

Velocities were projected and visualised onto UMAP embedding. Velocity-based pseudotime reconstruction was performed using latent time recovery of single-cell velocities with tl.recover_latent_time and tl.velocity_pseudotime of the Naïve, Activated, preGC and LZ GC B cell clusters. Dynamic gene expression changes were examined using tl.rank_velocity_genes for velocity-based sub-clustering (res=1) and top 200 genes per sub-cluster (ribosomal genes removed) were collapsed to unique genes for heatmap visualisation with smoothed scores. Gene expression or signature scores were quantified across pseudotime as smoothed normalised counts with geom_smooth() ±95% CI. For pseudotemporal analysis of the continuum of GC B cell states (Fig4), all GC B cell clusters were analysed with diffusion-based pseudotime (tl.dpt, 
            <rs type="software">Scanpy</rs>) independent of RNA velocity using default settings. Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) analysis was performed with

        <p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tonsil samples were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of ethanols to water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide before heat-mediated antigen retrieval with a citrate-based unmasking buffer (Vector Labs) at 120°C. 3 µm sections were incubated for 40 min at RT with anti-APE1 (1:1000; HPA002564; Sigma) or anti-FCRL3 (1:100; HPA048022; Sigma) before using the Super-sensitive-Polymer HRP system (Biogenex) with purple chromogen VIP (Vector Labs) and hematoxylin as a nuclear counterstain. Slides were scanned (Pannoramic250 Flash) before soaking in xylene to de-coverslip before rehydration through ethanol to water. De-staining and stripping of primary antibodies and heat-labile chromogen was achieved by a subsequent round of heat-mediated antigen retrieval. Anti-CD20 (1:500; M0755; Dako) was incubated for 40 min at RT, followed by detection, visualization and scanning as before. Negative controls were performed by treating sequential sections as above but without anti-CD20 staining to confirm complete stripping. Images were prepared using

        <p>Bulk B cell repertoire libraries of immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgH) were generated as described previously (5), with minor changes. 50 to 100 ng RNA from sorted B cell subsets were annealed to a pooled set of five isotype-specific IgH constant region primers containing unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) of either 10 or 12 nucleotides at 72°C for 5 min before being immediately placed on ice for 2 min. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) with recommended reagent concentrations and the following cycling conditions in a thermocycler: 105°C lid; 55°C 10 min; 80°C 10 min; 4°C hold. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and six IgH variable region primers containing 10 or 12 nucleotide UMIs with the following cycling conditions: 105°C lid; 98°C 4 min; 52°C 1 min; 72°C 5 min; 4°C hold. Double-stranded cDNA was then purified using (0.6X) Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) before amplification with Illumina adapter-containing primers (Nextera i7 indices) and NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB) as follows: 105°C lid; 98°C 30 seconds; (98°C 10 seconds, 72°C 50 seconds) × 22 to 28 cycles; 72°C 2 min; 4°C hold. Amplified libraries were purified using (0.6X) Ampure XP beads and quantified by Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit prior to multiplexing. Libraries were sequenced with a 5% PhiX spike-in using paired-end 301 bp reads on the Illumina MiSeq.Bulk B cell repertoire libraries of immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgH) were generated as described previously (5), with minor changes. 50 to 100 ng RNA from sorted B cell subsets were annealed to a pooled set of five isotype-specific IgH constant region primers containing unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) of either 10 or 12 nucleotides at 72°C for 5 min before being immediately placed on ice for 2 min.

        <p>Raw sequencing reads from bulk VDJ libraries were processed to generate UMI-collapsed consensus VDJ sequences using 
            <rs type="software">pRESTO</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">0.5.10</rs>) (59). Paired-end sequencing reads with mean Phred quality scores less than 25 were removed, and remaining sequences were annotated and trimmed for PCR primer and UMI sequences. UMI barcodes were then filtered by length and the presence of ambiguous nucleotides, prior to UMI alignment using 
            <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">3.8.31</rs>) (60). To correct for sequencing or other errors, we generated consensus sequences from UMIs with at least 3 unique sequencing reads required, prior to assembly of paired-end UMI consensus sequences into a single VDJ contig and annotation of constant region isotype using 
            <rs type="software">MaskPrimers.</rs>
            <rs type="version">py</rs> align to correct for primer misalignment.
        </p>
        <p>Duplicate VDJ sequences within each subset were collapsed using 
            <rs type="software">CollapseSeq.py</rs> before VDJ gene assignment and functional annotation with 
            <rs type="software">AssignGenes.py</rs> (ChangeO v
            <rs type="version">0.4.5</rs>) (61) and 
            <rs type="software">IgBLAST</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">1.12.0</rs>) (62).
        </p>
        <p>Following initial quality control, all single-cell VDJ sequences were combined together with bulk BCR repertoire sequences from the same donor for subsequent processing. IgH sequences were annotated using 
            <rs type="software">AssignGenes.py</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">IgBLAST</rs> before isotype class assignment prior to correction of ambiguous V gene assignments using 
            <rs type="software">TIgGER</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">0.3.1</rs>) (61,63). Clonally-related IgH sequences were identified using 
            <rs type="software">DefineClones.py</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">ChangeO</rs>) with a nearest neighbour distance threshold of 0.0818, as determined by the mean 99% confidence interval of all 8 donors with distToNearest (Shazam v0.1.11) (61). CreateGermlines.py was then used to infer germline sequences for each clonal family and observedMutations was used to calculate somatic hypermutation frequencies for each IgH sequence.
        </p>
        <p>Sequences with somatic hypermutation frequencies greater than 0.02 were annotated as "High" mutation levels, those between 0 and 0.02 as "Low" mutation levels and 0 as "None". For bulk BCR repertoire analysis in Figure 1, single-cell VDJ sequences were excluded, providing ~1.5 million highconfidence and unique IgH sequences, with a median of 14 UMIs per sequence, a median of 28,918 unique sequences per donor per subset and approximately 96-99% of these sequences annotated as functional by 
            <rs type="software">IgBlast</rs>. To quantify antibody class switch hierarchies, lineage trees for expanded clonotypes were constructed via maximum parsimony using 
            <rs type="software">buildPhylipLineage</rs> (Alakazam v
            <rs type="version">0.2.11</rs>) (61). The observed frequency of direct edges between unique sequences of different isotypes were counted and expressed relative to the frequency of such transitions expected by chance (calculated by iterative (k=100) random sampling of isotype frequencies) within each B cell subsets.
        </p>
        <p>Single-cell VDJ analysis was performed broadly as described previously (64). Briefly, the number of quality filtered and annotated IgH, IgK or IgL were determined per unique cell barcode prior to integration with single-cell gene expression objects. If more than one contig per chain was identified, PCA (RunPCA), nearest neighbour graph (
            <rs type="software">FindNeighbors</rs>) and unbiased clustering (
            <rs type="software">FindClusters</rs>).
        </p>
        <p>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualise integrated and lineagespecific datasets. B cells were annotated with scVDJ metadata from the integrated repertoire analysis detailed above and features such as isotype frequency, SHM levels and clonal properties were used to improve confidence of cell type annotation (such as between naïve and MBC clusters).Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualise integrated and lineagespecific datasets.

        <p>To evaluate potential cell-cell communication, we used CellPhoneDB (v2.0.6) (75) to examine the expression of ligand-receptor pairs between different scRNA-seq clusters. Briefly, we exported raw gene count matrices from 
            <rs type="software">Seurat</rs>, converted gene IDs to 
            <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> IDs using 
            <rs type="software">bioMart</rs>. We re-annotated all non-lymphoid cell type clusters as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), naïve and effector T cell groups by CD4 or CD8 expression, Treg and Tfr as "Treg" and rare GC subsets (prePB and FCRL3 high ) as "GC" and exported cell type metadata for use with raw count data using the "statistical_analysis" command of 
            <rs type="software">CellPhoneDB</rs> with database v2.0.0. The number of unique significant ligand-receptor co-expression pairs (putative interactions; p value&lt;0.05) between each cell type was then counted and visualised as a heatmap, while exemplar interacting pairs were visualised by calculating mean average expression level of gene 1 in cell type 1 and gene 2 in cell type 2 are indicated by colour and p values indicated by circle size.
