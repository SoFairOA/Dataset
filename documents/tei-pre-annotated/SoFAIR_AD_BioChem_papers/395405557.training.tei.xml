        <p>The Zoonomia Project is investigating the genomics of shared and specialized traits in eutherian mammals. Here we provide genome assemblies for 131 species, of which all but 9 are previously uncharacterized, and describe a whole-genome alignment of 240 species of considerable phylogenetic diversity, comprising representatives from more than 80% of mammalian families. We find that regions of reduced genetic diversity are more abundant in species at a high risk of extinction, discern signals of evolutionary selection at high resolution and provide insights from individual reference genomes. By prioritizing phylogenetic diversity and making data available quickly and without restriction, the Zoonomia Project aims to support biological discovery, medical research and the conservation of biodiversity.The Zoonomia Project is investigating the genomics of shared and specialized traits in eutherian mammals.

        <p>The genomics revolution is enabling advances not only in medical research 1 , but also in basic biology 2 and in the conservation of biodiversity, where genomic tools have helped to apprehend poachers 3 and to protect endangered populations 4 .

        <p>Comparative genomics can address this challenge by identifying nucleotide positions that have remained unchanged across millions of years of evolution 6 (suggesting that changes at these positions will negatively affect fitness), focusing the search for disease-causing variants. In 2011, the 29 Mammals Project 7 identified 12-base-pair (bp) regions of evolutionary constraint that in total comprise 4.2% of the genome, by measuring sequence conservation in humans plus 28 other mammals. These regions proved to be more enriched for the heritability of complex diseases than any other functional mark, including coding status 8 . By expanding the number of species and making an alignment that is independent of any single reference genome, the Zoonomia Project was designed to detect evolutionary constraint in the eutherian lineage at increased resolution, and to provide genomic resources for over 130 previously uncharacterized species.Comparative genomics can address this challenge by identifying nucleotide positions that have remained unchanged across millions of years of evolution 6 (suggesting that changes at these positions will negatively affect fitness), focusing the search for disease-causing variants.

        <p>When selecting species, we sought to maximize evolutionary branch length, to include at least one species from each eutherian family, and to prioritize species of medical, biological or biodiversity conservation interest. Our assemblies increase the percentage of eutherian families with a representative genome from 49% to 82%, and include 9 species that are the sole extant member of their family and 7 species that are critically endangered 9 (Fig. 1): the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hirola (Beatragus hunteri), Russian saiga (Saiga tatarica tatarica), social tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis), indri (Indri indri), northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) and black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis).When selecting species, we sought to maximize evolutionary branch length, to include at least one species from each eutherian family, and to prioritize species of medical, biological or biodiversity conservation interest.

Since 1975, The Frozen Zoo has stored renewable cell cultures for about 10,000 vertebrate animals that represent over 1,100 taxa, including more than 200 species that are classified as vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered or extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 10 .

        <p>We used two complementary approaches to generate genome assemblies (Extended Data Table 1). First, for 131 genomes we generated assemblies by performing a single lane of sequencing (2× 250-bp reads) on PCR-free libraries and assembling with 
            <rs type="software">DISCOVAR</rs> de novo 11 (referred to here as '
            <rs type="software">DISCOVAR</rs> assemblies'). This method does not require intact cells and uses less than two micrograms of medium-quality DNA (most fragments are over 5 kilobases (kb) in size), which allowed us to include species that are difficult to access (Extended Data Figs. 1,2) while achieving 'contiguous sequences constructed from overlapping short reads' (contig) lengths comparable to those of existing assemblies (median contig N50 of 46.8 kb, compared to 47.9 kb for Refseq genome assemblies).
        </p>
        <p>For nine 
            <rs type="software">DISCOVAR</rs> assemblies and one pre-existing assembly (the lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi)), we increased contiguity 200-fold (the median scaffold length increased from 90.5 kb to 18.5 megabases (Mb)) through proximity ligation, which uses chromatin interaction data to capture the physical relationships among genomic regions 12 . Unlike short-contiguity genomes, these assemblies capture structural changes such as chromosomal rearrangements 13 . The upgraded assemblies increase the number of eutherian orders that are represented by a long-range assembly (contig N50 &gt; 20 kb and scaffold N50 &gt; 10 Mb) from 12 to 18 (out of 19). We are working on upgrading the assembly of the large treeshrew (Tupaia tana) for the remaining order (Scandentia).

With a total evolutionary branch length of 16.6 substitutions per site, we expect only 191 positions in the human genome (0.000006%) to be identical across the aligned species owing to chance (false positives) rather than evolutionary constraint (Extended Data Table 2). We applied this same calculation to data from The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)-who analysed exomes for 60,706 humans 14 -and estimated that 88% of positions would be expected to have no variation.

        <p>We next asked whether a reference genome from a single individual can help to identify populations with low genetic diversity to prioritize in efforts to conserve biodiversity. Diversity metrics reflect demographic history 25,26 , and heterozygosity is lower in threatened species 27 . This analysis was feasible because we used a single sequencing and assembly protocol for all 
            <rs type="software">DISCOVAR</rs> assemblies, which minimized variation in accuracy, completeness and contiguity due to the sequencing technology and the assembly process that would otherwise confound species comparisons.

        <p>We estimated genetic diversity for 130 of our DISCOVAR assemblies, each of which represented a different species (Supplementary Table 3). Four of these estimates failed during analysis. For the remaining 126 DIS-COVAR assemblies, we calculated 2 metrics: (1) the fraction of sites at which the sequenced individual is heterozygous (overall heterozygosity); and (2) the proportion of the genome that resides in an extended region without any variation (segments of homozygosity (SoH)).

Genomic diversity varies significantly among species in different IUCN conservation categories, as measured by overall heterozygosity (Fig. 2a) and SoH values (Fig. 2b). SoH values increase (P = 0.024, R 2 = 0.055, n = 94) with increasing levels of conservation concern, whereas heterozygosity decreases (P = 0.011, R 2 = 0.064, n = 101).

        <p>Unusual diversity values can suggest particular population demographics, although data from more than a single individual are needed to confirm these inferences. All seven critically endangered species have SoH values that are higher than the median for species categorized as of least concern (Fig. 2e). The genomes with the lowest heterozygosity and highest SoH values were the social tuco-tuco (heterozygosity = 0.00063 and SoH = 78.7%), which was sampled from a small laboratory colony with only 12 founders 29 , and the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) (heterozygosity = 0.0008 and SoH = 81.3%), which was supplied by a professional mole catcher and was probably from a population that had experienced a bottleneck owing to pest control measures.Unusual diversity values can suggest particular population demographics, although data from more than a single individual are needed to confirm these inferences.

        <p>The correlation between diversity metrics and IUCN category is not explained by other species-level phenotypes.

The most significant was between SoH value and litter size, a trait that has previously been shown to predict extinction risk 31 (P SoH = 0.02), but none is significant after Bonferroni correction (Extended Data Table 3).The correlation between diversity metrics and IUCN category is not explained by other species-level phenotypes.

Should this pattern prove robust across more species, diversity metrics from a single reference genome could help to identify populations that are at risk-even when few species-level phenotypes are documented-and to prioritize species for follow-up at the population level.Our inference that diversity trends lower in species at a higher risk of extinction comes from a small fraction (2.6%) of threatened mammals 9 .

        <p>Our genomes have two notable limitations.

This highlights a dilemma that faces all large-scale genomics initiatives: determining when the value of sequencing additional individuals exceeds the value of improving the reference genome itself.Our genomes have two notable limitations.

        <p>We aligned the genomes of 240 species (our assemblies and other mammalian genomes that were released when we started the alignment) as part of a 600-way pan-amniote alignment using the 
            <rs type="software">Cactus</rs> alignment software 37 (Supplementary Table 2). Rather than aligning to a single anchor genome, Cactus infers an ancestral genome for each pair of assemblies (Fig. 3a). Consistent with our predictions, we have increased power to detect sequence constraint at individual bases relative to previous studies 7,38 . We detect 3.1% of bases in the human genome to be under purifying selection in the eutherian lineage (false-discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 5%), without using windowing or other means to integrate contextual information across neighbouring bases. This is more than double the number from the largest previous 100-vertebrate alignment 38 (Fig. 3b), with improvements being most notable in the non-coding sequence (Fig. 3c) and in the increased resolution of individual features (Fig. 3d). This represents a substantial proportion-but not all-of the 5 to 8% of the human genome that has previously been suggested to be under purifying selection 7,39 .

        <p>Species were selected to maximize branch length across the eutherian mammal phylogeny, and to capture genomes of species from previously unrepresented eutherian families. Of 172 species initially selected for inclusion, we obtained sufficiently high-quality DNA samples for genome sequencing for 137.

        <p>DNA integrity for each sample was visualized via agarose gel (at the Broad Institute) or Agilent tape station (at Uppsala University). Samples passed quality control if the bulk of DNA fragments were greater than 5 kb. DNA concentration was then determined using Invitrogen Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit. For each of the samples that passed quality control, 1-3 μg of DNA was fragmented on the Covaris E220 Instrument using the 400-bp standard programme (10% duty cycle, 140 PIP, 200 cycles per burst, 55 s). Fragmented samples underwent SPRI double-size selection (0.55×, 0.7 × f) followed by PCR-free Illumina library construction following the manufacturer's instructions (Kapa no. KK8232) using PCR-free adapters from Illumina (no. FC-121-3001). Final library fragment size distribution was determined on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA Chips. Paired-end libraries were pooled, and then sequenced on a single lane of the Illumina HiSeq2500, set for Version 2 chemistry and 2×250-bp reads. This yielded a total of mean 375 million (s.d. = 125 million) reads per sample.DNA integrity for each sample was visualized via agarose gel (at the Broad Institute) or Agilent tape station (at Uppsala University).

        <p>Genome upgrades. We selected genomes from each eutherian order without a pre-existing long-contiguity assembly on the basis of (1) whether the underlying assembly met the minimum quality threshold needed for HiRise upgrades; and (2) whether a second sample of sufficient quality could be obtained from that individual. All upgrades were done with Dovetail Chicago libraries and assembled with HiRise 2.1, as previously described 51 .Genome upgrades.

        <p>Heterozygosity calls. We applied the standard 
            <rs type="software">GATK pipeline</rs> with genotype quality banding to identify the callable fraction of the genome 52,53 . First, we used 
            <rs type="software">samtools</rs> to subsample paired reads from the unmapped .bam files 54 . After removing adaptor sequences from the selected reads, we used 
            <rs type="software">BWA-MEM</rs> to map reads to the reference genome scaffolds of &gt;10 kb, removing duplicates using the 
            <rs type="software">PicardTools</rs> MarkDuplicates utility 55 . We then called heterozygous sites using standard 
            <rs type="software">GATK</rs>-Haplotypecaller specifications, and with additional gVCF banding at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 99 qualities. We used the fraction of the genome with genotype quality &gt;15 for subsequent analyses. For the lists of high-confidence variant sites, we include only heterozygous positions after filtering at GQ &gt;20, maximum DP &lt;100, minimum DP &gt;6, as described in the README file at

        <p>Inferring overall heterozygosity. To avoid confounding by sex chromosomes or complex regions, we excluded all scaffolds with less than 0.5 or greater than 2× of the average sample read depth, then calculated global heterozygosity as the fraction of heterozygous calls over the whole callable genome.Inferring overall heterozygosity.

        <p>Calling SoH. We estimated the proportion of the genome within SoH using a metric designed for genomes with scaffold N50 shorter than the expected maximum length of runs of homozygosity (our median scaffold N50 is 62 kb). We first split all scaffolds into windows with a maximum length of 50 kb, with windows ranging from 20 to 50 kb for scaffolds &lt;50 kb. For each window, we calculated the average number of heterozygous sites per bp. We discriminated windows with extremely low heterozygosity by using the Python 
            <rs type="version">3.5.2</rs> pomegranate package to fit a two-component Gaussian mixture model to the joint distribution of window heterozygosity, forcing the first component to be centred around the lower tail of the distribution and allowing the second to freely capture all the remaining heterozygosity variability 56,57 . As heterozygosity cannot be negative, and normal distributions near zero can cross into negative values, we used the normal cumulative distribution function to correct the posterior distribution by the negative excess-effectively fitting a truncated normal to the first component. The final SoH value was calculated using the posterior maximum likelihood classification between both components. We saw no significant correlation between contig N50 and SoH (Pearson correlation = 0.055, P = 0.57, n = 112).

        <p>Assessing the effect of the percentage of callable genome. We assessed whether the percentage of the genome that was callable (Supplementary Table 3) was likely to affect our analysis. The callable percentage was correlated with heterozygosity (r = -0.80, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 , n = 130), and weakly with SoH values (r = 0.18, P = 0.06, n = 112). There is no significant difference in callable percentage among IUCN categories (analysis of variance P = 0.98, n = 122) or between captive and wild populations (t-test P = 0.81, n = 120).Assessing the effect of the percentage of callable genome.

        <p>Analysing patterns of diversity. We excluded two genomes with exceptionally high heterozygosity (heterozygosity &gt;0.02; &gt;5 s.d. above the mean). Both were of non-endangered species, and thus removing them made our determination of lower heterozygosity in endangered species more conservative. Of the remaining 124 genomes, we excluded 19 with allelic balance values that were more than one s.d. above the mean (&gt;0.36). Abnormally high allelic balance can indicate sequencing biases with potential for artefacts in estimates of heterozygosity and/or SoH. Our final dataset contains heterozygosity values for 105 genomes and SoH values for 98 genomes (Supplementary Table 3). For seven genomes, we were unable to estimate SoH because the two components of the Gaussian mixture model overlapped completely. To ask about a possible directional relationship between level of IUCN concern and overall heterozygosity or SoH, we applied regression using the IUCN category as an ordinal predictor. We also asked about the relationship of diversity metrics to a set of species-level phenotypes for which correlations were previously reported (Extended Data Table 3).Analysing patterns of diversity.

        <p>The alignment was generated using the progressive mode of Cactus 37,58 . The topology used for the guide tree of the alignment was taken from 
            <rs type="software">TimeTree</rs> 47 ; the branch lengths of the guide tree were generated by a least-squares fit from a distance matrix. The distance matrix was based on the UCSC 100-way phyloP fourfold-degenerate site tree 38 for those species that had corresponding entries in the 100-way tree. For species not present in the 100-way tree, distance matrix entries were more coarsely estimated using the distance estimated from

        <p>Cactus does not attempt to fully resolve the gene tree when multiple duplications take place along a single branch, as there is an implicit restriction in Cactus that a duplication event be represented as multiple regions in the child species aligned to a single region in the parent species. This precludes representing discordance between the gene tree and species tree that could occur with incomplete lineage-sorting or horizontal transfer. However, the guide tree has a minimal effect on the alignment, with little difference between alignments with different trees-even when using a tree that is purposely wrong 37 . Phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting that affect a subset of species are unlikely to substantially affect the detection of purifying selection across the whole eutherian lineage described in Fig. 3.Cactus does not attempt to fully resolve the gene tree when multiple duplications take place along a single branch, as there is an implicit restriction in Cactus that a duplication event be represented as multiple regions in the child species aligned to a single region in the parent species.

        <p>The alignment was generated in several steps, on account of its large scale. First, a backbone alignment of several long contiguity assemblies was generated, using the genomes of two non-placental mammals (Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus)), to inform the reconstruction of the placental root. Next, separate clade alignments were generated for each major clade in the alignment: Euarchonta, Glires, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria and Xenarthra. The roots of these clade alignments were then aligned to the corresponding ancestral genomes from the backbone, stitching these alignments together to create the final alignment. The process of aligning a genome to an existing ancestor is complex and further described in an accompanying Article that introduces the progressive mode of Cactus 37 .The alignment was generated in several steps, on account of its large scale.

        <p>We created a neutral model for the conservation analysis using ancestral repeats detected by 
            <rs type="software">RepeatMasker</rs> 60 on the eutherian ancestral genome produced in the Cactus alignment (tRNA and low-complexity repeats were removed). To fit the neutral model, we used

            <rs type="software">REV</rs> (generalized reversible) model and EM optimization method. The training input was a MAF exported on columns from the set of ancestral repeats mentioned above. Because 
            <rs type="software">phyloFit</rs> does not support alignment columns that contain duplicates, if a genome had more than one sequence in a single alignment block, these were replaced with a single entry representing the consensus base at each column.

        <p>The expected number of variants conserved by chance (false positives) was estimated for four genomic resources (the 29 Mammals Project 7 dataset, the human-only ExAC 14 and gnomAD v.3 datasets, the Zoonomia Project dataset) by applying a Poisson model of the distribution of substitution counts in the genome. Branch length for gnomAD was estimated by dividing 526,001,545 single-nucleotide variants by 3.088 gigabases (size of the human genome). Branch length for Zoonomia was measured as the number of substitutions per site in the phyloP analysis of the Cactus alignment.The expected number of variants conserved by chance (false positives) was estimated for four genomic resources (the 29 Mammals Project 7 dataset, the human-only ExAC 14 and gnomAD v.3 datasets, the Zoonomia Project dataset) by applying a Poisson model of the distribution of substitution counts in the genome.

        <p>All phenotypes in the PanTHERIA database 30 for which at least 75% of the 75 species of least concern had a value were included in the analysis. For continuous phenotypes, values were standardized to Z-scores before analysis (latitude was calculated as an absolute value) and correlation measured by fitting a linear model using the core R function lm. For categorical phenotypes with more than two categories, group means were compared using the core R function aov to fit an analysis of variance model. None was significant after Bonferroni correction for the number of traits considered (21).All phenotypes in the PanTHERIA database 30 for which at least 75% of the 75 species of least concern had a value were included in the analysis.
