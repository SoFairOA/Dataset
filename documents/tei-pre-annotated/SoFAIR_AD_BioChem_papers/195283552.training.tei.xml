        <p>Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome. Methods and results: We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index. Conclusion: MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual-or summary-level data.Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure.

        <p>In many scenarios in which we wish to estimate the causal effect of an exposure X on an outcome Y, a conventional regression analysis can be misleading, as the observational association between the two variables could easily be affected by unobserved confounding. If genetic variantsusually single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-are available that reliably predict the exposure variable but do not have an effect on the outcome through any other pathway, then they are valid instrumental variables (IVs) and can be used in a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to obtain unconfounded estimates of the effect of the exposure on the outcome, as illustrated in Figure 1.In many scenarios in which we wish to estimate the causal effect of an exposure X on an outcome Y, a conventional regression analysis can be misleading, as the observational association between the two variables could easily be affected by unobserved confounding.

        <p>In many scenarios, we may wish to estimate the effect of multiple exposures on the outcome using MR analysis, e.g. because we believe these exposures to be closely related or because we believe one exposure may mediate the relationship between the exposure of primary interest and the outcome. This can be done with multivariable MR (MVMR) in which a set of genetic variants is used to predict a set of exposure variables. However, careful consideration needs to be given in such an analysis to exactly what relationship is being estimated and how the IV assumptions required for MR analysis apply to a MVMR analysis. In this paper, we build on previous work developing MVMR methods with two-sample summary-level data 1,2 and fully explain how MVMR can be implemented with either individual-level or two-sample summary-level data, exactly what is being estimated in a MVMR analysis and how the IV assumptions required for MR analysis translate to MVMR analysis. We describe existing tests that can be used to test the IV assumptions with individual-level data and add to the previous literature on MVMR by developing new methods to identify potential violations of the IV assumptions with two-sample summary-level data.In many scenarios, we may wish to estimate the effect of multiple exposures on the outcome using MR analysis, e.g. because we believe these exposures to be closely related or because we believe one exposure may mediate the relationship between the exposure of primary interest and the outcome.

        <p>To state the IV assumptions more formally with reference to Figure 1, for a single SNP G j to be a valid IV, it must be: IV1: associated with the exposure X (the 'relevance' assumption); IV2: independent of the outcome Y given the exposure X (the 'exclusion restriction'); and IV3: independent of all (observed or unobserved) confounders of X and Y, as represented by U (the 'exchangeability' assumption); If IV1-IV3 are satisfied for a set of SNPs G ¼ G 1 ; . . . ; G L ð Þ , then traditional IV methods can be employed to reliably test for a causal effect of X on Y using G, X and Y alone, without any attempt to adjust for U at all.

[8][9][10] In order to satisfy IV1, the SNPs in G should strongly predict the exposure X. This can be quantified using the F-statistic from the first stage regression of X on G. Using instruments that are jointly only weakly associated with the exposure (i.e. which have a small F-statistic) will result in weak-instrument bias. 11 Second, SNPs should not exert a direct effect on Y, i.e. they should not affect Y other than through X. Any such effect would represent a violation of IV2. Horizontal pleiotropy, where the genetic variants used as instruments have an effect on the outcome that is not through the exposure of interest, is a violation of the exclusion restriction and could easily be responsible for such a violation in the MR setting. 10,[12][13][14] The SNPs should also not be confounded by any variables that also influence the outcome. Any confounding of this nature would be a violation of assumption IV3. A violation of either assumptions IV2 or IV3 is likely to lead to bias and potentially erroneous conclusions in both the TSLS and IVW estimates. 4 The presence of potential pleiotropic effects can be evaluated using the Sargan test 15,16 using individual-level data and Cochran's Q statistic [17][18][19] using summary data. The causes and consequences of pleiotropy in MR are described in detail elsewhere. 1,9,10,13,14,20 In addition to assumptions IV1-IV3, there are additional assumptions and considerations that apply to all instrumental variable estimation, including MR and MVMR. These included the assumptions of linearity and homogeneity that are in many settings required for obtaining a point estimate of the causal effect. However, if this assumption is violated, the causal null will still be respected and it will still be possible to identify whether the exposures are causally associated with the outcome. [21][22][23] Throughout this analysis, we assume linearity of the relationship between the exposures and the outcome although, if this assumption did not hold, the same issues would apply to MVMR as apply in MR analysis, which are discussed in detail elsewhere. 24,25When the SNPs are uncorrelated, taking an inverse variance weighted (IVW) average of the ratio estimates will yield an overall estimate for b, bIVW , that closely approximates the TSLS estimate that would have been obtained if individual-level data were available. 7 Detecting 'weak' instruments and 'invalid' instruments in MR If assumptions IV1-IV3 are fulfilled for all SNPs in G, and linear Equations ( 1) and (2) hold, then either a TSLS or IVW analysis (with uncorrelated SNPs) will consistently estimate the causal effect.

        <p>MR can be extended to estimate the effect of multiple exposure variables on an outcome 1 and is particularly useful in cases where a standard MR analysis would fail due to violation of assumptions IV2 and IV3. It is also useful in cases where two or more correlated exposures are of interest and may help to understand whether both exposures exert a causal effect on the outcome, or whether one in fact mediates the effect of the other on the outcome. 26,27 MVMR requires a set of SNPs, G, that are associated with the exposure variables but do not affect the outcome other than through these variables. In the same way as standard (single-variable) MR, these SNPs can be used to predict each of the exposure variables in the model and these predicted values can be used to estimate the effect of the exposures on the outcome in a multivariable regression analysis. The setup for MVMR is illustrated for an analysis involving two exposure variables (X 1 and X 2 ) in Figure 2. The arrows linking X 1 with X 2 and X 2 with Y have been left bi-directional to acknowledge the fact that many underlying causal relationships are possible, i.e. they could point in either direction or be completely absent.

Instruments must not, however, exert a direct effect on the outcome, except through the included exposures. There is no benefit to excluding instruments that are only strongly associated with one exposure, as this will lead to a loss of precision in the estimates obtained.

        <p>For example, if Figure 3 describes the truth, the total effect of exposure X 1 on the outcome is the effect of X 1 on the outcome Y directly plus the effect of X 1 on Y via X 2 , and is equal to b 1 þ ab 2 . The direct effect of the exposure X 1 on the outcome Y is the effect X 1 has on Y not via any other exposure variables included, and so is equal to b 1 : Whether or not these effects differ in general depends on the underlying relationship between the exposures and between each exposure and the outcome. If there is no effect of X 1 on X 2 or of X 2 on Y, i.e. either a or b 2 is equal to zero, these effects will be the same.

        <p>Focusing our attention on exposure X 1 , the results from these simulations show that MVMR always gives an unbiased estimate of the direct effect of X 1 on the outcome. In the hypothetical case in which only the valid SNPs for X 1 (G 1 ) are used as instruments in a single-variable MR, the estimated effect of X 1 on Y is the total effect of a change in X 1 on the outcome. Whether the direct or total effect is of more interest to practitioners will depend on the particular situation being considered. In many of the scenarios explored, the direct effect equals the total causal effect; however, when X 2 is a mediator of the relationship between X 1 and the outcome, the direct and total effects of X 1 may be substantially different. In this scenario, MVMR is not a form of mediation analysis, but instead estimates the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome that does not act via the mediator. The results from the simulations are given in Supplementary Table 2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online, and a summary table of what is estimated by each method in each scenario is given in Table 1.Focusing our attention on exposure X 1 , the results from these simulations show that MVMR always gives an unbiased estimate of the direct effect of X 1 on the outcome.

        <p>When conducting the univariable MR estimation with a subset of the SNPs in G, we have, for illustration, assumed 'oracle' knowledge on which SNPs are valid instruments for each exposure. This will, of course, not be possible in practice For example, in Scenario 1, if we select SNPs because they are associated with a X 1 , we will select the entire set G, but this will include the subset ðG 2 ; G 12 ), which exerts pleiotropic effects on the outcome Y and thus biases the analysis. Table 1 indeed shows that, when all SNPs in G are used for a univariable MR analysis, it will deliver a biased and inconsistent estimate of the total causal effect of X 1 on Y in Scenarios 1, 3 and 4. MVMR, by contrast, will then provide a consistent estimator of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome; the consistency of IV analysis under a range of scenarios that include those discussed here has been proved elsewhere. 3,4,30 These simulation results also highlight that MVMR does not introduce bias into the results when X 2 is a collider of the relationship between X 1 and Y. This is because the predicted value of X 2 , X2 , which is not dependent on the outcome, is used in the analysis. Of course, adjusting directly for X 2 , rather than X2 , would bias the analysis.

        <p>In addition to assumptions IV1-IV3, there are additional assumptions and considerations that apply to all instrumental variable estimation, including MR and MVMR. These included the assumptions of linearity and homogeneity, which is in many settings required for obtaining a point estimate of the causal effect. Increasing the number of exposures in two-sample MVMR will make this a stronger assumption due to the increased number of SNPs and exposures. When implementing MVMR analysis, this limitation should be considered and weighed against the benefits when deciding how many exposures to include in the analysis. Another additional assumption, particularly relevant to two-sample MVMR analysis, is that all data are drawn from the same underlying population. Throughout our analysis, we assume this to hold.

        <p>In any MR analysis, the set of genetic instruments G must be strong in order to avoid weak-instrument bias (assumption IV1). In single-variable MR analysis, weak instruments will bias the estimated results in the direction of the observational estimate; however, in MVMR analysis, it is not clear what direction the bias of the estimation result for each exposure will take as a result of weak instruments. 33 It is therefore important to test the strength of the instruments in any MVMR analysis; however, the assessment of instrument strength is more complicated. It is necessary for G to strongly predict both X 1 and X 2 (as quantified by strong F-statistics), but not sufficient. In addition, G must also jointly predict both X 1 and X 2 , i.e. once the secondary exposure X 2 has been predicted using G, G must still be able to predict the primary exposure X 1 . Figure 5 illustrates three scenarios (A-C) in which this may not be the case, even when both exposures appear to be strongly predicted individually by G and a fourth scenario (D) in which both exposures are strongly predicted.In any MR analysis, the set of genetic instruments G must be strong in order to avoid weak-instrument bias (assumption IV1).

This F-statistic can be compared with the standard critical values for weak instruments; therefore, if the conditional F-statistic for all of the exposure variables is larger than the rule-of-thumb value of 10, then the instruments can be considered adequately strong for the purposes of MVMR.• X 2 is regressed on the full set of genetic instruments (and any control variables included in the estimation) and the predicted value of X 2 , X2 , is calculated; • X 1 is then regressed on X2 (and any control variables) to yield the TSLS estimate d and the residual error terms X 1 À dX 2 are saved; • the errors are then regressed on the full set of instruments (and any control variables); the conditional F-statistic is obtained as the F-statistic for the effect of the instruments in this regression; • the conditional F-statistic must be adjusted for a degreesof-freedom correction, and can be compared with the conventional weak-instrument critical values. 34 For multiple exposure variables, the first step is repeated for each of the exposures and all of these predicted values are included in the regression in the second step.

        <p>If no pleiotropy exists amongst the genetic variants, then each one should identify the same causal parameter.

It is calculated by the following steps:If no pleiotropy exists amongst the genetic variants, then each one should identify the same causal parameter.

In order to conduct this test, the model must be over-identified, i.e. there must be more instruments than exposure variables (so that the degrees of freedom of the v 2 test is positive). 35 This 'global' test does not give any indication as to which of the genetic instruments are invalid if the test rejects the null. However, alternative methods of estimation can be used to estimate the causal effects as long as at least 50% of the SNPs do not have a pleiotropic effect on the outcome. 36,37 The two-sample summary data setting Assessment of instrument validity and strength is apparently yet to be described in the two-sample summary data setting that is relevant to the majority of contemporary MR studies, and consequently it is not implemented in any standard software. We therefore describe the necessary procedures in fine detail so that they can be confidently implemented by others.

Individuals were invited to a clinic where they answered a questionnaire and interview about a range of health topics and provided anthropomorphic measurements and gave samples of blood, urine and saliva. This study has been described in full previously. 43 Individuals in UK Biobank were asked to report the highest educational qualification they had obtained. For each individual, we assigned an age at which they left education based their reported qualification.

        <p>Cognitive ability was measured among a subset of the UK Biobank participants as the number of correct answers recorded in a series of 13 questions designed to measure cognitive ability that where completed as part of the initial clinic. The cognitive ability variable was then standardized to have mean zero and variance 1. BMI was calculated based on the height and weight of the individuals in the sample. Throughout the analysis, we analysed this variable on the natural log scale because of its skewed distribution.Cognitive ability was measured among a subset of the UK Biobank participants as the number of correct answers recorded in a series of 13 questions designed to measure cognitive ability that where completed as part of the initial clinic.

        <p>We first conducted MR analyses for the effect of education and cognitive ability on BMI separately using single-variable MR. A single composite instrument for education was created using the polygenic score of 74 SNPs from a recent GWAS of educational attainment. 44 A single composite instrument for cognitive ability was created using the polygenic score of 18 SNPs from a recent GWAS of cognition. 45 As this GWAS was conducted using the interim release of UK Biobank, we restricted our analysis to individuals not included in the interim release.We first conducted MR analyses for the effect of education and cognitive ability on BMI separately using single-variable MR.

        <p>The results from this analyses, along with a multivariable OLS regression of BMI on education and cognitive ability, are given in Table 3. The OLS results show that each extra year of education is associated with a decrease in BMI. MR and MVMR results suggest a causal effect in the same direction, but with a larger magnitude. The results for cognitive ability are more mixed, with no association seen in the OLS results, a negative total effect of cognitive ability on BMI in the MR analysis and potentially a positive direct effect of cognitive ability on BMI observed in the MVMR analysis. Our empirical and theoretical investigation helps to clarify why the the high level of correlation between education and cognitive ability would lead to the conclusion that there is a negative effect of cognitive ability on BMI in MR analysis. The MVMR results show that, if anything, the direct effect of increasing cogntive ability is to increase BMI. These results highlight the potential benefits of MVMR. However, before giving much credence to this result, it is necessary to assess the strength of our SNPs to jointly predict education and cognitive ability.The results from this analyses, along with a multivariable OLS regression of BMI on education and cognitive ability, are given in Table 3.

        <p>As a measure of the strength of the instruments, we calculate the standard F-statistic for both education and cognitive ability and the Sanderson-Windmeijer partial F-statstic 33 for the multivariable MR analysis. As all F-statistics are much larger than the rule-of-thumb cut-off of 10, we are reassured that the instruments are not individually weak. However, the partial F-statistic for both education and cognitive ability is significantly lower, showing that the power of the instruments to predict both variables simultanously is greatly reduced.As a measure of the strength of the instruments, we calculate the standard F-statistic for both education and cognitive ability and the Sanderson-Windmeijer partial F-statstic 33 for the multivariable MR analysis.

        <p>To illustrate two-sample MVMR, we randomly divided the sample used for the individual analysis into three equally sized groups. For each SNP used in the polygenic score, we then calculated its effect on log(BMI), education and cognitive ability using different parts of the sample. The results were then used to conduct a two-sample MVMR analysis. The results are given in Supplementary Table 4, available as Supplementary data at IJE online. They show that increased education has a direct effect that decreases BMI and cognitive ability has no direct effect on BMI. The results are in line with those obtained from the individual-level analysis.To illustrate two-sample MVMR, we randomly divided the sample used for the individual analysis into three equally sized groups.

        <p>The Q cog statistic for cognitive ability is 1488.8. The critical value for a v 2 distribution with 88 degrees of freedom at the 5% level is 110.9.

        <p>An alternative procedure that has been recently proposed to adjust for pleiotropy beyond that explainable by genetically predictable exposures (e.g. X 1 and X 2 ) is a multivariable MR Egger regression. 46 This is a natural extension of the original MR Egger approach 1 and is calculated by fitting the two-sample MVMR model with a constant included:An alternative procedure that has been recently proposed to adjust for pleiotropy beyond that explainable by genetically predictable exposures (e.g. X 1 and X 2 ) is a multivariable MR Egger regression. 46 This is a natural extension of the original MR Egger approach 1 and is calculated by fitting the two-sample MVMR model with a constant included:</p>
        <p>If the constant is different from zero, this suggests that additional pleiotropy is meaningfully biasing the analysis. However, a generalization of the InSIDE assumption is required in order for it to deliver unbiased causal estimates. These are described in detail elsewhere. 1 The two-sample results were used to fit multivariable MR Egger regression, the results of which are given in Supplementary Table 5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online. Its intercept parameter is estimated to be small, and consequently the estimated effects of the exposures do not differ from those in the two-sample MVMR estimation. This supports the suggestion that the SNPs do not exert a direct effect on BMI apart from through education or cognitive ability. As MR Egger is dependent on the orientation of the SNP-exposure associations, we repeated this analysis with the associations orientated so that the SNP education associations where all positive and then with the SNP cognitive ability associations all positive. These changes had no substantive effect on the results obtained.If the constant is different from zero, this suggests that additional pleiotropy is meaningfully biasing the analysis.

        <p>The difference between the Q statistic and multivariable MR Egger estimation suggests an inconsistency between these two tests, although this may have arisen due to a high level of variation in the effect of the SNPs on each exposure leading to a higher Q statistic. This is supported by Figure 7A andB, which give individual MR plots for each exposure and show that there is a large amount of variation of the SNPs on each of the exposures. Repeating this analysis with the outlying SNP excluded makes no substantive difference to the results obtained.The difference between the Q statistic and multivariable MR Egger estimation suggests an inconsistency between these two tests, although this may have arisen due to a high level of variation in the effect of the SNPs on each exposure leading to a higher Q statistic.

        <p>The MVMR Egger analysis was repeated using the effect of each SNP on education, cognitive ability and BMI taken from GWAS estimates. 44,45,47 The magnitude of the estimated effects differ in this analysis, as the outcome variable is BMI rather than the natural log of BMI, although these results also show no pleiotropic effect of the SNPs on the outcome and a negative effect of higher education on BMI.

        <p>In this paper, we have attempted to explain the principled application and interpretation of instrumental variable analysis to the epidemiological setting with multiple exposures. We first focused on the individual data setting, for which it is possible to borrow well-established methods (and related software) from the econometrics literature. We then considered the two-sample setting and built upon previous research in this area by developing new tests for assessing the validity and relevance of the genetic instruments.

        <p>We finally illustrated the application of MVMR using individual-and summary-level data to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on BMI. The results from this analysis show that increasing education leads to lower BMI and the size of this effect increases when cognitive ability is controlled for. Comparing the single-exposure MR analysis results (with all SNPs that affect educational attainment excluded) with the MVMR results for cognitive ability shows a large change in the size and direction of the effect. This result suggests that education is a mediator of the relationship between cognitive ability and BMI and any direct effect of cognitive ability on BMI is minimal.We finally illustrated the application of MVMR using individual-and summary-level data to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on BMI.

        <p>The methods we describe can be used to estimate the effect of multiple related exposures on an outcome using either individual-level or summary-level data. Although we have focused on the case of two exposures for ease of explanation, all of these methods can be easily applied to scenarios with three or more exposures. An advantage of MVMR analysis is that SNPs that are thought to potentially affect multiple exposure variables, or where it is not clear exactly which exposure they affect, can be included when estimating the effects of the exposures on the outcome. This makes MVMR particularly useful when the exposures are closely related or one (or more) is thought to be a potential pleiotropic pathway from the SNPs to the outcome. MVMR will also produce consistent estimates when there is measurement error in any of the exposure variables and therefore is a useful method of analysis when multiple exposure variables are thought to be subject to measurement error.The methods we describe can be used to estimate the effect of multiple related exposures on an outcome using either individual-level or summary-level data.

        <p>As with all MR analysis, it is important to ensure that the IV assumptions are satisfied. Here, we explain how the IV assumptions apply to a MVMR analysis. We describe existing tests that can be used to test the assumptions in individual-level data and propose tests that can be used with two-sample summary-level data. These new tests are a key strength of this work, as MVMR cannot be effectively used as part of the tools a researcher has available for analysis unless the potential pitfalls of the analysis are well understood. Our applied results highlight the importance of considering the IV assumptions in the context of the particular analysis being conducted as, even when the instruments appear to be very strong for each of the exposures individually, this does not guarantee that they will be equally as strong for the exposures when estimated jointly in a MVMR model. For example, the F-statistics decrease from 195 and 310 to 36 and 37 for educational attainment and cognitive ability, respectively.As with all MR analysis, it is important to ensure that the IV assumptions are satisfied.

        <p>A practical limitation of the new tests we develop for two-sample summary data MVMR is the reliance on knowledge of the covariance between the effect of the SNP on each exposure. These results are not available in conventional GWAS results, and it would be infeasible to calculate them in advance for every possible combination of exposure variable that could be included in a MVMR model. Unfortunately, our work shows that this information is strictly needed for valid inference. In order to conduct these tests in summary-level data, we therefore have to make a choice about how to treat these missing pieces of information. If the data were available, it can be directly calculated from the individual -level data for the particular MVMR study being conducted. Alternatively, it could be assumed to be zero, or set to zero by using non-overlapping GWAS studies for each exposure, as the standard error of the estimated SNP effects will not correlate across different samples. This is an important limitation of the results given here for testing the assumptions of two-sample summary data MVMR.A practical limitation of the new tests we develop for two-sample summary data MVMR is the reliance on knowledge of the covariance between the effect of the SNP on each exposure.

        <p>Another weakness of the instrument relevance test we develop is that this is a test for whether the SNPs can conditionally explain any of the variation in the exposure variables, rather than being a more usual weak-instrument test, such as the rule of thumb of F being greater than 10 for a univariable MR analysis or the Sanderson-Windmeijer conditional Fstatistic for IV analysis with individual-level data. Extending this test to weak instrument is an area for future work.Another weakness of the instrument relevance test we develop is that this is a test for whether the SNPs can conditionally explain any of the variation in the exposure variables, rather than being a more usual weak-instrument test, such as the rule of thumb of F being greater than 10 for a univariable MR analysis or the Sanderson-Windmeijer conditional Fstatistic for IV analysis with individual-level data.
