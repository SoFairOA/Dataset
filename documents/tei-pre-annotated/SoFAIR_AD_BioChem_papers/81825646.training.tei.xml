        <p>Background: Local and systemic inflammatory responses are initiated early after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and may play a key role in the secondary injury processes resulting in neuronal loss and neurological deficits. However, the mechanisms responsible for the rapid expansion of neuroinflammation and its long-term progression have yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the role of microparticles (MP), a member of the extracellular vesicle family, in the exchange of pro-inflammatory molecules between brain immune cells, as well as their transfer to the systemic circulation, as key pathways of inflammation propagation following brain trauma. Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact TBI for 24 h, and enriched MP were isolated in the blood, while neuroinflammation was assessed in the TBI cortex. MP were characterized by flow cytometry, and MP content was assayed using gene and protein markers for pro-inflammatory mediators. Enriched MP co-cultured with BV2 or primary microglial cells were used for immune propagation assays. Enriched MP from BV2 microglia or CD11b-positive microglia from the TBI brain were stereotactically injected into the cortex of uninjured mice to evaluate MP-related seeding of neuroinflammation in vivo.Background: Local and systemic inflammatory responses are initiated early after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and may play a key role in the secondary injury processes resulting in neuronal loss and neurological deficits.

        <p>Results: As the neuroinflammatory response is developing in the brain after TBI, microglial-derived MP are released into the circulation. Circulating enriched MP from the TBI animals can activate microglia in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases MP release from microglia in vitro and enhances their content of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-1β and microRNA-155. Enriched MP from activated microglia in vitro or CD11b-isolated microglia/ macrophage from the TBI brain ex vivo are sufficient to initiate neuroinflammation following their injection into the cortex of naïve (uninjured) animals.Results: As the neuroinflammatory response is developing in the brain after TBI, microglial-derived MP are released into the circulation.

        <p>Conclusions: These data provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the development and dissemination of neuroinflammation after TBI. MP loaded with pro-inflammatory molecules initially released by microglia following trauma can activate additional microglia that may contribute to progressive neuroinflammatory response in the injured brain, as well as stimulate systemic immune responses. Due to their ability to independently initiate inflammatory responses, MP derived from activated microglia may provide a potential therapeutic target for other neurological disorders in which neuroinflammation may be a contributing factor.Conclusions: These data provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the development and dissemination of neuroinflammation after TBI.

        <p>Microparticles (MP; also called microvesicles), a type of extracellular vesicle, are small membrane-bound bodies shed from the plasma membrane and released by cells during activation or cell death [1]. They are composed of the plasma membrane along with a limited amount of cytoplasm and measure 100 to 1000 nm in diameter [2]. MP are enriched in the lipid microdomains, where cholesterol, phospholipids, and receptors are clustered [3], and are distinguished from other extracellular vesicles such as exosomes (30-100 nm; endosomal origin) and apoptotic bodies (1000-2000 nm) [1]. MP can be released from virtually all cell types in the brain and contain molecular signals in the form of non-secreted proteins and DNA/RNA/microRNA (miR) molecules that may be involved in cell-to-cell communication during neurodevelopment and synaptic physiology [4]. MP and other extracellular vesicles have also been implicated in the development and progression of various neurological diseases [4]. For example, in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy accumulation and cell-tocell transmission of infectious prion proteins (PrP sc ), extracellular vesicles are a key mechanism of prion disease propagation [5,6]. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, accumulating evidence indicates that a mechanism for the progressive accumulation of misfolded mutant form of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is cell-to-cell propagation of SOD1 within the brain via extracellular vesicles that extend the range and toxicity during disease [7,8]. Similar mechanisms are thought to contribute to neurotoxic amyloid-β formation in Alzheimer's disease models [9][10][11]; however, these data are more controversial given that other studies have shown that exosome-associated amyloid-β are neuroprotective [12,13].Microparticles (MP; also called microvesicles), a type of extracellular vesicle, are small membrane-bound bodies shed from the plasma membrane and released by cells during activation or cell death [1].

        <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cell death and neurologic dysfunction through secondary injury mechanisms characterized by edema, neuronal cell death, glial activation, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells, among others [14]. The inflammatory response to TBI is highly complex and includes rapid proliferation and migration of resident microglia to the site of injury in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other factors released by injured tissue [15], as well as by infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocyte subsets that contribute to the injury milieu [16]. If the immune response is unable to resolve effectively, or becomes dysregulated after TBI, it can contribute to chronic neurodegeneration, due to chronic activation of neurotoxic microglia [17]. Elevated levels of MP have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of TBI patients [18], and circulating MP derived from endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes have been measured acutely after severe isolated TBI [19]. These include cerebral endothelium-derived MP release following focal contusion injury [20] as well as neuronal-and astroglialderived MP release following mixed contusion and diffuse axonal injury [21].Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cell death and neurologic dysfunction through secondary injury mechanisms characterized by edema, neuronal cell death, glial activation, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells, among others [14].

        <p>Given the increasingly recognized role for neuroinflammation in tissue damage after TBI, we examined whether posttraumatic circulating MP released after injury could be derived from microglia, as well as potential mechanisms of microglial MP involvement in cell-to-cell communication in the brain following trauma. We hypothesized that MP released by microglia contain proinflammatory molecules that contribute to the spread of brain inflammation. We used flow cytometry to identify the origin of brain-specific immune-related MP in the circulation following controlled cortical impact in mice. To investigate immunogenic properties of microglial-derived MP, we used BV2 microglia and primary microglial cell culture models. Finally, to demonstrate cell-to-cell propagation of neuroinflammatory mechanisms within the brain, we injected enriched MP derived from microglia isolated from TBI cortex or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated microglia into the cortex of uninjured mice.Given the increasingly recognized role for neuroinflammation in tissue damage after TBI, we examined whether posttraumatic circulating MP released after injury could be derived from microglia, as well as potential mechanisms of microglial MP involvement in cell-to-cell communication in the brain following trauma.

        <p>Our custom-designed controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5-mm diameter tip. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N 2 O and 30% O 2 and administered through a nose mask (induction at 4% and maintenance at 2%). Depth of anesthesia was assessed by monitoring respiration rate and pedal withdrawal reflexes. Mice were placed on a heated pad, and core body temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the surgical site was clipped and cleaned with Nolvasan and ethanol scrubs. A 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, the skin and fascia were reflected, and a 5-mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. The impounder tip of the injury device was then extended to its full stroke distance (44 mm), positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the cortical surface. Moderate-level TBI was induced using an impactor velocity of 6 m/s and deformation depth of 2 mm as previously described [22]. After injury, the incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45 min post-injury. Sham animals underwent the same procedure as TBI mice except for the impact.Our custom-designed controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5-mm diameter tip.

        <p>Mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, I.P.), and blood was collected in heparinized syringes by aortic puncture. Blood was immediately combined with fixative (100 μl/ml Caltag Reagent A fixation medium, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to diminish ex vivo microparticle (MP) aggregation. All reagents and solutions used for MP analysis were sterile and filtered (0.1-μm filter). Heparinized blood was centrifuged for 5 min at 1500×g, and supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000×g for 30 min to pellet platelets and other cell debris [23]. Blood supernatants were used to collect total blood MP (~250 μl) that were purified by adding PBS (4 ml) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 60 min at 4 °C as previously described [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30]. In each experiment, flow cytometry in combination with microbead standards ranging in size from 300 to 3000 nm was used to characterize MP size. MP were distinguished from larger (apoptotic body; &gt;1000 nm) and smaller (exosomes; &lt;100 nm) vesicles based on size (SSC), and their phenotype was confirmed using the unique MP surface marker, annexin V (details below; see Fig. 1a). In parallel experiments, equal numbers of circulating MP from sham and TBI mice (8 × 10 5 MP) were resuspended in 100 μl serum-free DMEM media and co-cultured with BV2 microglia (2 × 10 4 cells/well) for 24 h at 37 °C and at 5% CO 2 prior to cell extraction for markers of microglial activation.

Data represent results of three independent experiments Total and cell-derived MP were identified by flow cytometry using an eight-color, triple-laser MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). MACSQuant was calibrated every other day with calibration beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and forward and side scatters were set at logarithmic gain. Photomultiplier tube voltage and triggers were optimized to detect submicron-sized particles. Microbeads of different diameters (0.3 μm (Sigma; LB3), 1.09 μm (Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL; BCP-10-5), and 3.0 μm (Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL; BP-30-5)) were used to set initial parameters and to confirm MP characteristics in each experiment. To reduce small particle contaminants, all reagents and solutions used for MP analysis were sterile and filtered (0.1-μm filter; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) before use. The expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on MP was detected using an anti-annexin V (FITC or APC) (1:50, BD Biosciences PharMingen, catalog no: 556419) in annexin buffer (5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 136 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1% BSA; pH 7.4). MP were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. Annexin buffer (150 μl) was added to each sample prior to MACSQuant analysis. Truenegative controls were established by a fluorescenceminus-one analysis and using isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies at the same concentration and under the same conditions. Annexin V-positive particles with diameters from 300 to 1000 nm were defined as MP.

To establish the dose of PEG-TB required to neutralize microglial-derived MP, we performed a dose response study in control and LPS-stimulated enriched MP derived from BV2 microglia and incubated them with increasing concentrations of PEG-TB for 1 h prior to MP characterization by flow cytometry.

Specifically, recipient BV2 microglia incubated with LPS MP + PEG-TB had significantly reduced expression of IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001) and TNF-α (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to the LPS MP group (Fig. 5c). We confirmed the effects of LPS-stimulated enriched MP on primary cortical microglia. There was a significant increase in IL-1β (p &lt; 0.01), TNF-α (p &lt; 0.01), and IL-6 (p &lt; 0.05) mRNA in recipient primary microglia treated with LPS enriched MP when compared to control MPtreated cells (Fig. 6). There was also a significant increase in miR-155 expression in primary microglia (p &lt; 0.01) treated with LPS enriched MP when compared to cells treated with control MP (Fig. 6).</p>

        <p>Finally, we confirmed that the effects of LPS enriched MP on microglial activation were not due to LPS crossover. We measured LPS levels in the LPS enriched MP samples using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and determined that the LPS concentration was negligible (0.081 ± 0.009 EU/ml (&lt;0.1 ng)) and well below LPS concentrations previously shown to transfer LPS activity in enriched MP [34].Finally, we confirmed that the effects of LPS enriched MP on microglial activation were not due to LPS crossover.

        <p>To determine whether microglial-derived enriched MP could seed neuroinflammation in the uninjured brain, we isolated enriched MP from control and LPSstimulated BV2 microglia and stereotactically injected them into the cortex of adult male C57BL/6 mice. As a control to demonstrate the specific activity of microglialderived enriched MP in promoting brain inflammation, we neutralized enriched MP by co-incubating them with PEG-TB as described before. After 24 h, cortical tissue was collected and markers of brain inflammation were assessed. When LPS enriched MP were injected into the uninjured cortex, they produced a robust neuroinflammatory response resulting in a significant increase in IL-1β (p &lt; 0.01), NOS2 (p &lt; 0.01), TNF-α (p &lt; 0.001), IL-6 (p &lt; 0.05), and miR-155 (p &lt; 0.01) when compared to the Fig. 6 Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MP activate primary cortical microglia.

        <p>In a separate study, control and LPS enriched MP were stereotactically injected into the cortex of uninjured C57BL/6 mice. At 7 days post-surgery, mice were euthanized and brain tissue was saline perfused and fixed for immunohistochemical analysis of microglial activation in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus using Iba-1 and P2Y12 immunostaining. There was a significant increase in Iba-1 staining in the ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of C57BL/6 injected with LPS enriched MP (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to mice injected with control MP or sham mice (Fig. 8a-c). Further morphological analysis of P2Y12-positive microglia using 
            <rs type="software">Neurolucida</rs> reconstruction software revealed that C57BL/6 mice injected with LPS enriched MP resulted in increased microglial activation. Specifically, microglial ramifications were significantly reduced in length in the cortex and hippocampus of the LPS enriched-MPinjected cortex (p &lt; 0.01 for both vs control MP), and the microglial cell body area was significantly increased in the cortex (p &lt; 0.001), hippocampus (p &lt; 0.01), and thalamus (p &lt; 0.01 vs control MP; Fig. 9a-c). These data indicate that enriched MP derived from LPS-stimulated microglia produce a robust neuroinflammatory response when injected into the cortex of uninjured mice.

        <p>Microparticles produced by microglia/macrophage isolated from the TBI brain induce neuroinflammation in non-injured mice To relate MP-mediated seeding of neuroinflammation to secondary injury mechanisms in the TBI brain, we subjected adult male C57BL/6 mice to sham or moderatelevel TBI and isolated microglia/macrophages from the ipsilateral cortex at 7 days post-injury using MACS CD11b magnetic beads. We then cultured CD11b-positive cells for 24 h and collected microglia/macrophage-derived enriched MP from sham and TBI samples. Equal numbers of enriched MP (total 8 × 10 3 MP) were stereotactically injected into the cortex of uninjured adult male C57BL/6 mice, and cortical tissue was collected 24 h later to assess markers of neuroinflammation. Injection of sham MP significantly increased IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001) and TNF-α (p &lt; 0.001) expression, but not miR-155 expression, when compared to the naïve control group (Fig. 10). Furthermore, injection of TBI enriched MP significantly increased IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001), TNF-α (p &lt; 0.05), and miR-155 (p &lt; 0.01) expression in the cortex when compared to the sham MP-injected group. Although there was a modest increase in IL-6 and NOS2 expression in sham MP and TBI enriched MP-injected groups when compared to the naïve control group, these changes did not reach statistical significance.

        <p>Recent studies have highlighted the potential systemic pathological effects of MP following brain injury, including brain-trauma-associated coagulopathy [21]. MP released from neurons (NSE-positive MP) and astrocytes (GFAPpositive MP) accumulated in the circulation within 3 h of experimental TBI and were associated with microvascular fibrin deposition in the heart, kidney, and lung [21]. We observed a significant increase in total circulating MP at 24 h post-injury. Furthermore, an evaluation of the origin of circulating MP based on the presence of unique markers derived from parental cells revealed that microglial MP displayed the greatest increase (approximately twofold) following TBI, accounting for nearly 15% of total circulating MP. Although P2Y12 is also expressed on platelets [40], the detected P2Y12-positive MP were co-stained with CD45, a unique myeloid cell marker that is not expressed on platelets [41,42], indicating that the P2Y12positive MP enriched in the circulation following TBI were not derived from platelets. These data indicate that microglial-derived MP are released by the TBI brain and reach the systemic circulation. Importantly, we observed robust neuroinflammatory responses in the injured brain-with activation of P2Y12-positive microglia in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus-associated with upregulated expression of classical pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, IL-6, NOS2, and miR-155) in the injured cortex. Previous studies indicated that microglia and other myeloid cells in vitro can shed MP, which store and release pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1β [43], inflammasome components, and MHCII protein [44]. These data suggest that MP produced by reactive myeloid cells, such as microglia, may propagate inflammation and the rapid dissemination and presentation of antigens. A major finding of our study was that circulating enriched MP from TBI mice significantly activated recipient microglia in vitro and up-regulated pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as IL-1β and CCL2.Recent studies have highlighted the potential systemic pathological effects of MP following brain injury, including brain-trauma-associated coagulopathy [21].

        <p>Similarly, MP from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia significantly increased IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, IL-6, NOS2, and miR-155 expression in recipient BV2 or primary microglia, confirming the ability of MP to act as independent microglial activators. LPS stimulation of microglia is an established in vitro model for TBI neuroinflammation because LPS up-regulates key pro-inflammatory mediators in microglia (IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, CCL2) that are robustly up-regulated in microglia/macrophages in the injured cortex and hippocampus following TBI [31,45,46]. In the current study, we demonstrated that LPS-stimulated microglia release MP into conditioned media that can induce pro-inflammatory responses in non-activated recipient microglial cells. Importantly, MP depleted of their content by addition of We demonstrated that IL-1β and miR-155 were highly enriched in MP that can propagate a pro-inflammatory response in recipient cells. IL-1β does not contain an Nterminal signal sequence for secretion and therefore must be released from the cell through alternative mechanisms [47]. LPS stimulation increased IL-1β protein in enriched MP but not in microglia cells, where only IL-1β mRNA was elevated. Astrocyte-derived ATP has been shown to induce extracellular vesicle shedding and IL-1β release in microglia through a P2X7 receptordependent mechanism [43]. Notably, ATP is released following acute brain injury and promotes a powerful chemotactic response in microglia towards the site of injury [15]. In our study, the P2X7 receptor was significantly increased at sites of inflammation in the injured cortex; thus, P2X7 receptor-dependent mechanisms of MP release in microglia may be involved in the propagation of inflammation following TBI. Other mechanisms of MP release in microglia-such as MP fusion with the cell membrane, macropinocytosis [48], and direct release of their contents into the cytosol [37], as well as indirect mechanisms through binding of pattern-recognition receptors in the endosomal compartment (primarily Tolllike receptor 7/8-TLR7/8) [49]-may also contribute to the propagating neuroinflammation and warrant further investigation.Similarly, MP from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia significantly increased IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, IL-6, NOS2, and miR-155 expression in recipient BV2 or primary microglia, confirming the ability of MP to act as independent microglial activators.

        <p>MP can also transfer miRs [50][51][52][53]. The levels of miR-155, a well-characterized pro-inflammatory miR in microglia [54], were highly enriched in microglialderived MP. miR-155 has been shown to be a key regulator of the inflammatory response in experimental models of stroke, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis [55][56][57][58]. We also demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly increased in the cortex of TBI mice, and its expression was significantly increased when LPS-stimulated MP from BV2 microglia or MP from CD11b-positive microglia/macrophages from the TBI brain were injected into the cortex of uninjured mice. Secreted miR-155 from adipocyte-derived MP in obese mice induces a pro-inflammatory activation state in macrophages that causes chronic inflammation and local insulin resistance [59]. Thus, secreted miR-155 from MP may be an important driver of neuroinflammation following TBI.MP can also transfer miRs [50][51][52][53].

        <p>The pathogenic role of MP in the inflammatory response was demonstrated in vivo by showing that injection of microglial-derived MP induces neuroinflammation at the site of injection and at more distant sites. Cortical injection of enriched MP isolated from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia significantly increased markers of microglial activation (Iba-1 and P2Y12 morphological transformation) in the ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus and upregulated pro-inflammatory markers in the cortex. These data support prior research that demonstrated that myeloid-derived microvesicles that are detected in the CSF of multiple-sclerosis patients and closely associate with disease course can propagate inflammation in vivo when injected locally [60]. Furthermore, cortical injections of enriched MP collected from ex vivo cultures of microglia/ macrophages purified from TBI brain markedly induce expression of pro-inflammatory molecules miR-155, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the cortex of non-injured animals. To our knowledge, these latter observations describe the first use of purified brain microglia to demonstrate the transfer of the posttraumatic neuroinflammatory phenotype using MP as a vehicle.The pathogenic role of MP in the inflammatory response was demonstrated in vivo by showing that injection of microglial-derived MP induces neuroinflammation at the site of injection and at more distant sites.

In this study, we used established flow cytometry protocols to characterize MP properties [25], but this technique is limited to the identification of particles greater than 300 nm, preventing the detection of smaller microvesicles and all exosomes [61].

        <p>techniques such as dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle-tracking analyses have several limitations and introduce biases when characterizing extracellular vesicle properties [61,63,64]. The focus of the current study was the pathophysiological responses of microglial-derived MP rather than the nature of the enriched microvesicles. We determined that enriched MP derived from microglia could propagate neuroinflammation in vivo. We selectively depleted enriched MP by incubating them with PEG-TB, a drug that emulsifies MP without modifying circulating leukocyte activation [2,25]. When we co-cultured depleted MP from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia with recipient naïve BV2 microglia, or injected depleted MP into the cortex of uninjured mice, pro-inflammatory responses were significantly attenuated. These results support our hypothesis that it is the enriched MP component of purified extracellular vesicles derived from microglia that propagates neuroinflammation.techniques such as dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle-tracking analyses have several limitations and introduce biases when characterizing extracellular vesicle properties [61,63,64]. The focus of the current study was the pathophysiological responses of microglial-derived MP rather than the nature of the enriched microvesicles. We determined that enriched MP derived from microglia could propagate neuroinflammation in vivo.

        <p>The major findings of these studies are that (1) microglialderived MP are released after TBI, (2) circulating enriched MP from the TBI animals can activate microglia in vitro, (3) LPS activation increases MP release from microglia and elevates their content of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1β and miR-155, and (4) enriched MP from activated microglia in vitro or CD11b-isolated microglia from the TBI brain ex vivo are sufficient to initiate neuroinflammation following intracortical injection in naïve animals. Given their ability to independently initiate pro-inflammatory responses, MP derived from activated microglia may provide a novel therapeutic target for TBI and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with neuroinflammation.The major findings of these studies are that (1) microglialderived MP are released after TBI, (2) circulating enriched MP from the TBI animals can activate microglia in vitro, (3) LPS activation increases MP release from microglia and elevates their content of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1β and miR-155, and (4) enriched MP from activated microglia in vitro or CD11b-isolated microglia from the TBI brain ex vivo are sufficient to initiate neuroinflammation following intracortical injection in naïve animals.
