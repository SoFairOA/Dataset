        <p>Gut microbiota has a proven role in regulating multiple neuro-chemical pathways through the highly interconnected gut-brain axis. Oral bacteriotherapy thus has potential in the treatment of central nervous system-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current AD treatments aim to prevent onset, delay progression and ameliorate symptoms. In this work, 3xTg-AD mice in the early stage of AD were treated with SLAB51 probiotic formulation, thereby affecting the composition of gut microbiota and its metabolites. This influenced plasma concentration of inflammatory cytokines and key metabolic hormones considered therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration. Treated mice showed partial restoration of two impaired neuronal proteolytic pathways (the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy). Their cognitive decline was decreased compared with controls, due to a reduction in brain damage and reduced accumulation of amyloid beta aggregates. Collectively, our results clearly prove that modulation of the microbiota induces positive effects on neuronal pathways that are able to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.Gut microbiota has a proven role in regulating multiple neuro-chemical pathways through the highly interconnected gut-brain axis.

        <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and irreversible neurodegeneration with a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Treating and managing AD patients is a severe burden, and there is an urgent need to discover and validate new therapeutic agents. Most cases of early-onset AD derive from a combination of genetic mutations in genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2). APP cleavage by β and γ secretase complexes leads to the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that can aggregate and form amyloid plaques, mainly composed of the 42 amino acid peptide (Aβ 1-42 ), which is less abundant but more prone to aggregation than the Aβ 1-40 peptide. Amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, comprising hyper phosphorylated tau protein, are the most important pathologic hallmarks of AD. Aβ deposition and clearance are finely regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, which are tightly interrelated 1-4 . Impairment of proteolysis, which is characteristic of AD neurons, favors the accumulation of detrimental Aβ oligomeric structures that further contribute to proteasome and autophagy alterations.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and irreversible neurodegeneration with a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function.

        <p>Recently, several authors have described a role for gut peptide hormones in AD. These hormones are responsible for energy homeostasis and food intake regulation and show effects on the central nervous system (CNS), modulating nervous functions like learning and memory [5][6][7] . Ghrelin is involved in glucose and lipid metabolisms, but also in higher brain functions such as learning and memory; it influences mitochondrial respiration and exerts neuroprotective effects, takes part in the aetiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, representing a link between metabolism and neurodegeneration 8 . Ghrelin and leptin act as neurotrophic factors protecting cells against toxicity induced by Aβ oligomers 5,9 . Plasma leptin concentration is negatively correlated to Aβ levels due to its direct regulatory effect on γ-secretase 10 .

        <p>Currently, no definitive treatment exists for AD, and most approaches aim to preserve cognition and memory and to delay the loss of function. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the human microbiome in regulating multiple neuro-chemical pathways through the highly interconnected host-microbiome system, the so-called gut-brain axis [18][19][20] . Oral bacteriotherapy is becoming an accepted practice for the prevention and treatment of allergies 21 , gastrointestinal infections 22 , inflammatory conditions 23,24 and cancer 25 . Beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in CNS-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cognitive deficits, and stress-derived pathologies, have been recently documented [26][27][28][29][30][31] . Probiotic supplementation reverses cognitive impairment and ameliorates the spatial memory in diabetic rats 32 . It has recently been shown that the probiotic mixture VSL#3 modulates the expression of a number of genes in the brain cortex of aged rats, with positive consequences on inflammatory and neuronal processes 33 . Moreover, bacterial byproducts such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) exert a number of neuromodulator effects and directly act on gastrointestinal cells stimulating the synthesis of hormones such as leptin and GLP-1 34,35 .Currently, no definitive treatment exists for AD, and most approaches aim to preserve cognition and memory and to delay the loss of function.

        <p>Briefly, the Rat/mouse Ghrelin Active ELISA kit is a sandwich ELISA based on the capture of ghrelin molecules (active form) in the plasma by anti-ghrelin IgG and the immobilization of the resulting complex to the wells of a microtiter plate coated by a pre-titered amount of anchor antibodies. After the binding of a second biotinylated antibody to ghrelin and the wash away of unbound materials, followed by conjugation of horseradish peroxidase to the immobilized biotinylated antibodies, the quantification of immobilized antibody-enzyme conjugates is performed by monitoring horseradish peroxidase activities in the presence of the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-m ethylbenzidine. The enzyme activity is measured spectrophotometrically by the increased absorbency at 450 nm, corrected from the absorbency at 590 nm, after acidification of formed products. Since the increase in absorbency is directly proportional to the amount of captured rat/mouse ghrelin (active form) in the unknown sample, the concentration of active ghrelin can be derived by interpolation from a reference curve generated in the same assay with reference standards of known concentrations of rat/mouse ghrelin.Briefly, the Rat/mouse Ghrelin Active ELISA kit is a sandwich ELISA based on the capture of ghrelin molecules (active form) in the plasma by anti-ghrelin IgG and the immobilization of the resulting complex to the wells of a microtiter plate coated by a pre-titered amount of anchor antibodies.

Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation of slides for 10 minutes with a protein-blocking agent (Protein-blocking agent, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) before application of the primary antibody. Slides were incubated overnight in a moist chamber. The immunoreaction with streptavidinimmunoperoxidase (Streptavidin-immunoperoxidase, Black &amp; Decker, Towson, MD, USA) was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate, Vector, Burlingame, UK). Tissues were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. For negative immunohistochemical controls the primary antibodies were omitted. Sections of human and bovine brain, AD and BSE respectively affected, served as positive control tissues for Aβ 1-42 and FGF9 cell staining. For scoring of Congo red, Aβ 1-42 , and FGF9 positive cells, these cells were quantified in different area of the mouse brain, particularly select compartments of the CNS as hippocampal area. All cellular types were evaluated using a light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), a 40x objective, a 10x eyepiece, and a square eyepiece graticule (10 × 10 squares, having a total area of 62,500 μm 2 ). Ten appropriate fields were chosen for each compartment and arithmetic means were calculated for each brain region. Results were expressed as IHC positive cells per 62,500 μm 2 . For all parameters, cells on the margins of the tissue sections were not considered for evaluation to avoid inflation of positive cell numbers.

Briefly, the brains were removed, placed in 10% buffered formalin, covered with aluminum foil, and refrigerated. Two-mm-thick sections were cut 4, 6, and 8 mm from the frontal pole, and sections were photographed within 24 h. To prevent distortion, brain slices were kept flat in the Petri dish overnight. After the sections had been photographed, they were routinely processed and paraffin embedded, then newly 3 µm sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and newly photographed. The serial sections were sub-divided into frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions of the brain in rostral to caudal direction. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the wall of the cerebral hemisphere were carried out on every 20th section. For each sub-group, 5 sections were analyzed. In each of these coronal sections, brains were stained with H&amp;E and the cortex thickness was measured. For the assessment of regional cortical atrophy the thicknesses of the wall and laminae was determined by thickness measurements on H&amp;E-stained sections. The different zones were measured using a calibrated integrating graticule (0.01mm) in a single eyepiece.

In particular, AD mice treated with the probiotic showed better "discrimination index" than untreated animals at 18 weeks of age, suggesting the beneficial effect of SLAB51 after 10 weeks of treatment. However, we could not see differences between 24-week-old treated and untreated mice.

However, higher entry latencies near the cut-off value (300 s), measured in the retention test, demonstrated that AD mice were able to memorize the punishment and to perform the inhibitory avoidance, indicating that triple mutation did not impair amygdala function.In the first experiment, 24-week-old treated and untreated AD mice underwent the passive avoidance test.

        <p>24-week-old treated and untreated AD mice, from the first experiment, were evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to analyze their anxiety-like behavior. Statistical tests computed on the % open arm entries (df = 28, t = 0.30, p &gt; 0.05) and on the % time spent in the open arms (df = 28, t = -1.08, p &gt; 0.05) revealed no significant between-group differences, reflecting the same level of anxiety-like responses in treated and untreated age-matched AD mice (Fig. 1, panel C). To verify that the beneficial effects of SLAB51 on attenuating cognitive impairment were not linked to an increased locomotor activity, AD mice (from the first experiment) were evaluated in an open field (OF) test at each time point (weeks 8, 12, 18 and 24). Two-way ANOVA revealed no differences in locomotor activity between treated and control AD groups (ambulatory counts: F[1,28] = 0.116, p &gt; 0.05; stereotypic counts: F[1,28] = 1.95, p &gt; 0.05) as shown in Table 1. These data suggested that SLAB51 treatment did not influence the locomotor activity of AD mice. Together, these findings rule out the possibility that, in the NOR, the different response between treated and control AD mice could depend upon differences in locomotor activity.24-week-old treated and untreated AD mice, from the first experiment, were evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to analyze their anxiety-like behavior.

        <p>These results are consistent with the expression levels of FGF9 in the hippocampal areas of 24 week-old mice (4 months of treatment), as reported in Fig. 1, panel D. Based on published data indicating that specific growth factor transcripts are altered in depressed, stressed, and AD-affected brains [56][57][58] , we selectively examined FGF9 differential expression in AD and wt mice. Results indicate a significant difference in FGF9 expression between treated and untreated AD mice, and a similar level and pattern of expression between treated AD and control wt mice. In fact, hippocampal FGF9 expression was consistently increased in untreated AD mice compared to treated AD and control wt mice. Thus, these analyses confirmed the alteration of FGF9 in depressive disorders, and show also its up-regulation in the altered hippocampus of AD-affected mice. Few studies have previously demonstrated the increased FGF9 expression in the frontal cortices 56 and locus coeruleus 57 in patients with major depression. Moreover, so far no data are available on the role of FGF9 in the hippocampus during AD or its role in the regulation of emotionality. Thus, our results could be helpful in elucidating the potential role of the hippocampal FGF9 in conditioning emotions and behavioral performances in AD.These results are consistent with the expression levels of FGF9 in the hippocampal areas of 24 week-old mice (4 months of treatment), as reported in Fig. 1, panel D.

        <p>The body weight of mice was controlled during the entire period of treatment and no differences were obtained between control and AD animals, indicating that the mixture was well tolerated.

        <p>Regarding brains morphology, it was immediately apparent that lateral ventricles were enlarged in 3 × Tg-AD untreated mice compared with SLAB51 treated animals (Fig. 1, panel F). In some areas of the brain, notable differences in the cortex thickness were observed between treated and untreated AD mice. Differences in thickness of the cerebral cortex were also minimal at t0 (8 weeks-old) and t1 (12 weeks-old), though the ventricular zone appeared slightly enlarged in untreated AD mice. Starting from t2 (18 weeks-od), the difference in cortical thickness became more pronounced between the two groups (Fig. 1, panel F) in particular in the hippocampal area (bregma -2.18 mm), at level of interventricular foramem (bregma -0,22 mm), and lateral ventricle at the point of alignment with the anterior arm of corpus callosum (bregma 0.62 mm). These data suggest the beneficial effect of SLAB51 in counteracting the decline of cortical thickness and the ventricular dilatation that are typical damages in AD brains.Regarding brains morphology, it was immediately apparent that lateral ventricles were enlarged in 3 × Tg-AD untreated mice compared with SLAB51 treated animals (Fig. 1, panel F).

        <p>PCoA plots of unweighted Unifrac distances revealed significant differences in microbiota structure between the wt and 3xTg-AD mice at all time points, but no significant differences were observed in species richness between wt and AD mice (Fig. 2). Considering untreated mice, lower concentrations of Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, Anaeroplasmatales, and Anaerostipes were present in AD mice with respect to wt mice, with Anaerostipes playing an important role in gut health for the ability to produce butyric acid 59 (Supplemental Table S1). Furthermore, the microbiota structure underwent more changes over the various time points in the 3xTg-AD, as the distances in the PCoA plots were larger, while the distances between the weeks clustered closer together in the wt mice. Moreover, treatment with SLAB51 induced larger changes in AD mice compared to wt mice. However, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, only a few bacterial taxa were found to be significantly different when either group of mice were or were not treated with SLAB51 (Supplemental Tables S2 andS3). Overall, similar changes in specific taxa were observed between the animal groups, and most notably, an increase in Bifidobacterium spp. and a reduction in Campylobacterales (i.e., Helicobacteriaceae; p = 0.04) was observed in both mouse groups when treated with SLAB51. The predicted functional bacterial metagenome content using PICRUSt revealed different effects of SLAB51 between wt and 3xTg-AD mice. While 14 pathways were increased (LDA score &gt;4.0) due to SLAB51 in the 3xTg-AD mice, only one pathway was increased in wt mice (Table 2).

Interestingly, Table 3 propionic and butyric acids significantly increased in AD mice upon SLAB51 treatment. Considering that the composition of gut microbiota and its metabolites can influence the inflammatory signaling, a panel of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been evaluated in the plasma of both wt and AD mice administered with water or SLAB51.Upon SLAB51 administration reduced plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in AD mice (Fig. 3), confirming that the modified microbiota produced anti-inflammatory effects.Additionally, the fecal content of SCFAs was evaluated considering that these bacterial byproducts are known to act on the brain and that may mediate the effect on AD pathology.

        <p>In detail, higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL12, IL17, IFNɣ, and TNFα were observed in untreated AD mice with respect to wt counterpart. Interestingly, upon SLAB51 treatment a significant decrease of IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL12, IFNɣ, and TNFα occurred. Moreover IL4, IL6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF, are less concentrated in the plasma of untreated AD mice with respect to wt mice. The probiotic treatment resulted in an increase of these cytokines that can down-regulate inflammatory response 60 . Collectively, these data are in agreement with the enriched gut content of the recognized anti-inflammatory SCFAs in AD mice upon probiotics supplementation.In detail, higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL12, IL17, IFNɣ, and TNFα were observed in untreated AD mice with respect to wt counterpart.

        <p>Increased gut hormone concentration with SLAB51 treatment. We measured the plasma concentration of the gut peptide hormones ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1 and GIP because of their neuroprotective effects and potential as therapeutic targets. No changes in hormone plasma levels were observed in treated wt mice compared to the respective controls. An age-dependent decrease of the levels of all the tested hormones was observed in untreated AD mice. Interestingly, treatment with the probiotic formulation specifically increased the plasma concentration of these hormones. Results indicate significantly increased levels of ghrelin and GIP in 18-and 24-week-old treated AD mice compared to their respective controls. The level of leptin upon SLAB51 administration increased in treated 24-week-old AD mice compared to untreated animals.

        <p>We then evaluated the accumulation of amyloid oligomers through western blotting and found a considerable reduction of these toxic structures in treated AD mice, at both 18 weeks and 24 weeks of age, compared to controls (Fig. 5, panel B). Congo red staining of brain Aβ plaques evidenced a significant reduction of extracellular amyloid deposits, associated with substantially lower levels of staining of somata and processes of hippocampal pyramidal cells from Ammon's horn, and in granule cells from dentate gyrus, especially in sections of AD mice treated with the SLAB51 mixture (Fig. 5, panel C). Regarding the effects of SLAB51 on wt animals, no significant changes in the amount of amyloid peptides were observed, as also demonstrated histologically in Congo red stained sections (Fig. 5, panel C). Moreover, immunoreactivity towards Aβ 1-42 peptide was progressively seen in somata and processes of hippocampal pyramidal cells and cortical neurons of untreated AD mice.

        <p>Effect of SLAB51 mixture on proteasomal and autophagic proteolytic activity. Brain homogenates were analyzed through enzymatic assays and western blotting analyses in order to monitor the functionality and expression levels of components of the proteolytic pathways UPS and autophagy. In wt mice, SLAB51 did not modify proteasome functionality at any time point. A different result was obtained when analyzing AD mice. In fact, proteasome activity decreased in 3xTg-AD control mice, whereas AD mice treated with SLAB51 showed partially restored activity. In particular, 18-and 24-week-old treated AD mice showed increased ChT-L, T-L, and PGPH activity compared to age-matched untreated controls. A re-establishment of BrAAP activity was already evident at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 6). A similar pattern was obtained measuring the ChT-L activity of the 26S proteasome, the complex in charge of the removal of ubiquitinated proteins, where a significant recovery of activity was evident in treated AD mice at each time point (Fig. 6). To confirm these data, we performed western blotting assays to detect p27, p53 and ubiquitinated proteins, known substrates of the proteasome and markers of its functionality. At the analyzed time points, treated and untreated wt mice showed no significant differences in the expression levels of these proteins (Fig. 7). As expected, AD mice displayed a considerable accumulation of the analyzed substrates due to the strong proteasome impairment typical of neurodegeneration 61 . Figure 6 indicates that in AD mice, SLAB51 treatment induced a decrease in the levels of these markers in agreement with the data from the activity assays. The reduction in the buildup of ubiquitinated proteins induced by SLAB51 was significant in 18-week-old mice, whereas the effects on p27 and p53 were already evident in 12-week-old mice.

        <p>No statistically significant differences in apoptotic levels were observed in 24-week-old treated AD mice and in treated or control wt mice. The considerable accumulation of p53 due to the strong proteasome impairment observed in untreated AD mice confirms the ability of this substrate to trigger the apoptotic pathway; as expected, treatment with the probiotic mixture induced a considerable decrease in apoptotic activity, regulating the levels of proteasome substrates. Among the lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin B and cathepsin L were evaluated. Cathepsin B (CatB) is a cysteine protease associated with amyloid plaques and suggested to reduce Aβ levels 62 . A decrease in Cathepsin B activity was observed in 18-and 24-week-old treated mice compared with controls. Conversely, SLAB51 was able to restore cathepsin L (CatL) activity in 18-and 24-week-old mice compared with controls (Fig. 9). This finding is of particular interest considering the ability of the enzyme to increase α-secretase activity, thereby suppressing Aβ levels 63 . Exposure to SLAB51 did not change the activity of either enzyme in wt mice.No statistically significant differences in apoptotic levels were observed in 24-week-old treated AD mice and in treated or control wt mice.

        <p>The levels of the autophagy-related proteins beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 were detected through western blotting assays. Beclin-1 plays a key role in autophagy, being involved in the enrolment of membranes to form autophagosomes 64 . LC3-II is tightly bound to the autophagosomal membranes and is an established autophagic marker 65 . p62 binds to both LC3-II and ubiquitin, and is finally degraded in autophagolysosomes. Therefore, p62 levels inversely correlate with autophagic activity 66 . Our data show that in AD mice, treatment with SLAB51 increased the levels of beclin-1 and LC3-II and decreased the amounts of p62, suggesting an activation of the autophagic flux (Fig. 9).The levels of the autophagy-related proteins beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 were detected through western blotting assays.

        <p>Significant differences in microbiota structure were observed at all time points between the wt and the 3xTg-AD mice, and these differences were independent of treatment. However, treatment with SLAB51 induced larger shifts in microbial communities in the 3xTg-AD mice, as evidenced by more pronounced changes in Unifrac distances. Interestingly, this did not lead to obvious differences in abundances of specific bacterial taxa, suggesting more gradual shifts across the entire microbiota. However, the functional content as predicted by PICRUSt was associated with more changes due to SLAB51 in AD mice, as more pathways were increased due to treatment. Of interest is that SLAB51 induced several metabolic pathways associated with energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism.Significant differences in microbiota structure were observed at all time points between the wt and the 3xTg-AD mice, and these differences were independent of treatment.

        <p>The increase in Bifidobacterium spp. and the reduction in Campylobacterales observed in AD mice upon administration with SLAB51 is important for the role of these bacteria in inflammatory pathways. In fact, Bifidobacterium strains possess anti-inflammatory properties principally attributed to small heat-stable, non-lipophilic compounds resistant to protease and nuclease treatments 71 . Moreover, certain species of genus Bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from LPS-stimulated macrophages 72 . Instead, immune-stimulatory effects of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli have been observed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells 73 . Additionally, in vivo studies demonstrated that the purified lipooligosaccharid of Campylobacter jejuni increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in chickens 74 . Upon SLAB51 administration reduced plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in AD mice (Fig. 3), confirming that modification of microbiota produced anti-inflammatory effects in probiotic administered subjects. Interestingly treated AD mice possess higher levels of G-CSF that is a modulator of systemic immune responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and has been demonstrated to decrease β-amyloid deposition and to reverse cognitive impairment in an AD mice model 60 . Behavioral tests highlight a positive effect of oral treatment with SLAB51 on behavioral performance in AD mice, suggesting the restoration of hippocampus functions, in agreement with published evidence supporting the idea that cognitive functions are affected by bacteria acting through the gut-brain axis. Some authors have demonstrated that certain strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium secrete essential neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine that mediate the positive impact of probiotics on behavior in neurological dysfunctions 75 . Additionally, an impact on anxiety of Campylobacter jejuni infection has been previously reported in central nervous system disorders 76 . In our study, the improved cognitive activity in treated AD mice did not correlate with different levels of anxiety. Interestingly, analysis of microbiota showed a reduced presence of Campylobacterales in the treated AD group compared with the untreated AD group (Supplementary Table 2). This result is valuable also considering that a high prevalence of Campylobacterales infections have been observed in AD patients and, after Helicobacter pylori eradication, cognitive and functional status parameters ameliorated 77 .The increase in Bifidobacterium spp. and the reduction in Campylobacterales observed in AD mice upon administration with SLAB51 is important for the role of these bacteria in inflammatory pathways. In fact, Bifidobacterium strains possess anti-inflammatory properties principally attributed to small heat-stable, non-lipophilic compounds resistant to protease and nuclease treatments 71 . Moreover, certain species of genus Bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from LPS-stimulated macrophages 72 . Instead, immune-stimulatory effects of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli have been observed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells 73 . Additionally, in vivo studies demonstrated that the purified lipooligosaccharid of Campylobacter jejuni increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in chickens 74 . Upon SLAB51 administration reduced plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in AD mice (Fig. 3), confirming that modification of microbiota produced anti-inflammatory effects in probiotic administered subjects. Interestingly treated AD mice possess higher levels of G-CSF that is a modulator of systemic immune responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and has been demonstrated to decrease β-amyloid deposition and to reverse cognitive impairment in an AD mice model 60 .

        <p>Improvement of cognitive function is supported by increased plasma concentration of gut hormones such as ghrelin, leptin, GLP1 and GIP. Peptide hormones secreted in the gut play a role in modulating nervous functions like learning and memory. The time-dependent decrease of both ghrelin and leptin plasma concentrations in AD mice are in agreement with previously published data showing altered peripheral levels of these hormones in AD patients 8,78 . Moreover, some authors previously demonstrated 3-4 months-old male 3xTg-AD mice exhibit significantly higher basal mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids mRNA levels in the hippocampus and increased glucocorticoids but decreased corticotrophin releasing hormone mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus compared to male WT mice 79 . Thus, the progressive decrease of circulating metabolic hormones concentration in untreated AD mice may be due to the unbalanced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In fact, these hormones are affected by several factors such as stress, and glucocorticoids levels 80 . Interestingly, mice treated with the probiotic mixture showed higher plasma levels of such hormones, and this is important because ghrelin has been proven to counteract memory deficits and synaptic degeneration in AD animal models 9 , and leptin has been demonstrated to act as neurotrophic factor and to exert neuroprotective effects against Equal protein loading was verified by using an anti-GAPDH antibody. The detection was executed by an ECL western blotting analysis system. Data points marked with an asterisk are statistically significant compared to 8-week-old control mice (*p &lt; 0.05). Data points marked with a hash are statistically significant compared to their respective control mice at the same time point ( # p &lt; 0.05). Uncropped gels are reported in Supplemental Figure 1. toxicity induced by Aβ oligomers in vitro 5,6 . These data correlate with the decreased Aβ deposits in the brains of treated AD mice, and they are in good agreement with evidence showing that plasma leptin concentration is negatively associated to Aβ levels due to a direct regulatory effect on the γ-secretase-mediated amyloidogenic pathway 10 . The age-related decline of plasma ghrelin concentration and the impairment of ghrelin signaling observed in AD patients are closely related to the compromised memory and learning processes. Oral administration of SLAB51 enhanced GLP-1 and GIP plasma concentrations in AD mice, resulting in a neuroprotective effect of both incretins 81 . Again, GLP-1 has been shown to reduce Aβ load in vivo and in cultured neuronal cells 14 . Interestingly, following SLAB51 administration an increase of the bacterial metabolites SCFAs has been detected in feces of AD mice. Considering that bacterial by products such as SCFAs exert a number of neuromodulator effects and directly act on gastrointestinal cells stimulating the synthesis of hormones like leptin and GLP-1 34 , our data contribute to define the link between gut microbiota modulation and metabolic hormones. Moreover, the enriched gut concentration of SCFAs, well recognized anti-inflammatory bioactive metabolites 82,83 is encouraging also because of the number of evidences supporting SCFAs therapeutic potential in neurodegenerations 84 . For example, histone deacetylase inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate is responsible for restoring fear learning, counteracting intraneuronal Aβ deposition, and regulating dendritic spine density by exerting a chaperone-like activity and via the transcriptional activation of key proteins in synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling 85 ; Here we show that SLAB51 administration exerts multiple effects by modulating gut microbiota composition and causing metabolic changes, such as the increase of SCFAs able to directly act in the gut and in the brain, due to their ability to pass the blood brain barrier 86 . Representative immunoblots and corresponding densitometric analyses obtained from five separate blots are shown. Equal protein loading was verified by using an anti-GAPDH antibody.

        <p>Innovatively, we show that probiotics counteracted the typical morphological alterations of AD, including the reduction in brain weight, the decline of cortical areas, and the general brain damage and shrinkage. Furthermore, SLAB51 contributed to a consistent reduction in the amount of cerebral Aβ, both in the form of peptides and oligomers. Consequently, a decreased number and size of amyloid plaques were observed upon treatment. Considering a recently published work in which Lactobacillus helveticus ameliorated APP metabolism in cell-based assays, favored memory in mice, and reduced Aβ 1-40 serum concentration in rats 87 , our findings prove a beneficial role for probiotic bacteria in AD subjects, identifying a synergistic effect obtained through the use of a successful formulation.Innovatively, we show that probiotics counteracted the typical morphological alterations of AD, including the reduction in brain weight, the decline of cortical areas, and the general brain damage and shrinkage.

        <p>Exploring proteolytic pathways, normally impaired in AD, we evaluated the ability of the treatment to restore their functionality in neurons. Several papers have described dramatically impaired proteasome functionality in AD 1,88 . For the first time, the probiotic mixture partially restored both 20S and 26S proteasomes activities. Enzymatic activities were confirmed through western blotting analyses investigating the levels of specific proteasomal substrates, such as ubiquitin conjugates, p27 and p53 proteins. All these proteins accumulated with proteasome inhibition, whereas their levels decreased upon SLAB51 treatment. In particular, as the treatment restores proteasome functionality, p53 levels diminished and a decrease in apoptotic levels was detected in granule cells from dentate gyrus of hippocampal areas, and in some pyramidal cells of the Ammon's horn of AD treated mice. An increase in p53 immunoreactivity has been previously observed in sporadic AD 89,90 , especially in cortical neurons undergoing neurofibrillary degeneration 91 . The time-dependent p53 increase in untreated AD mice is also in agreement with a work demonstrating that p53 is upregulated approximately 2-fold in the superior temporal gyrus of Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy elderly control subjects 92 .Exploring proteolytic pathways, normally impaired in AD, we evaluated the ability of the treatment to restore their functionality in neurons.

        <p>Moreover, SLAB51 administration triggered autophagy, as demonstrated by the decrease of cathepsin B activity and the increase of cathepsin L activity. These lysosomal enzymes are differently involved in AD development: the cysteine protease cathepsin B is associated with amyloid plaques in AD brains and has been suggested to be responsible for the increase in Aβ production. Conversely, cathepsin L activity increases α-secretase-mediated non-amyloidogenic pathway. Western blotting of autophagy markers confirmed that this pathway is activated in treated AD mice. Therefore another pioneering piece of evidence is that the SLAB51 probiotic formulation restored altered autophagy in AD. Collectively, biochemical analyses on proteolysis demonstrate that SLAB51 probiotic mixture significantly influences proteolysis, restoring impaired proteasome activities and consequently modulating the autophagic flux, confirming the crosstalk between the two pathways 1 . We believe that SLAB51's positive effects on proteolysis are mediated by increased gut hormones. In fact, in a recent paper we demonstrated that ghrelin controls neural homeostasis through direct regulation of UPS and autophagy in AD neuronal cells 93 .Moreover, SLAB51 administration triggered autophagy, as demonstrated by the decrease of cathepsin B activity and the increase of cathepsin L activity.

        <p>Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that autophagy negatively regulates Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling, which is involved in cell migration, apoptosis and differentiation of the CNS 94 , and its targets, among them FGF9. Our results show that treatment with SLAB51 restores autophagy and modulates gut hormone production in AD mice. These results suggest that microbiota composition influences Wnt signaling and provide an explanation of the reduced expression of FGF9 in the CNS. Increased levels of FGF9 in the hippocampus of subjects with major depressive disorder have been observed. In rodent models of affective disorders, chronic social defeat stress increased anxiety, compromised social interaction, and decreased body weight, and was associated with increased hippocampal FGF9 expression 95 . Accordingly, FGF-9 immunoreactivity has been detected in human hippocampal and cortical neurons, astrocytes, and dystrophic neurites of senile plaques, in hippocampal sections of AD patients 96 . In this study an association between hippocampal FGF9 expression and severity of lesions related to AD in mice was observed. Therefore, reduced hippocampal expression of FGF9 in 24-week-old AD mice treated with SLAB51, comparable to wt mice FGF9 hippocampal expression, contributes to the improvement of behavioral performances.Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that autophagy negatively regulates Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling, which is involved in cell migration, apoptosis and differentiation of the CNS 94 , and its targets, among them FGF9.

        <p>In this paper we provide evidence that by modulating gut microbiota several pathways are affected, consequently delaying AD progression. In 3xTg-AD mice, SLAB51 changed the composition of gut microbiota and its metabolites, positively interfering with inflammatory cytokines, gut hormones concentration and proteolysis, reducing Aβ load and improving cognitive function, demonstrating a role in the prevention and treatment of AD and supporting the idea of the gut microbiota modulation to counteract Aβ-mediated AD-type pathogenic processes.In this paper we provide evidence that by modulating gut microbiota several pathways are affected, consequently delaying AD progression.
