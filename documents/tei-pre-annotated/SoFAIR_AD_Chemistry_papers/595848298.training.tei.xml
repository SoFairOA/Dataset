        <p>Electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides to value-added chemicals is a promising strategy for mitigating the human-caused unbalance of the global nitrogen-cycle, but controlling product selectivity remains a great challenge. Here we show iron-nitrogen-doped carbon as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for selective nitric oxide reduction into hydroxylamine. Using in operando spectroscopic techniques, the catalytic site is identified as isolated ferrous moieties, at which the rate for hydroxylamine production increases in a super-Nernstian way upon pH decrease. Computational multiscale modelling attributes the origin of unconventional pH dependence to the redox active (non-innocent) property of NO. This makes the rate-limiting NO adsorbate state more sensitive to surface charge which varies with the pH-dependent overpotential. Guided by these fundamental insights, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 71% and an unprecedented production rate of 215 μmol cm -2 h -1 at a short-circuit mode in a flow-type fuel cell without significant catalytic deactivation over 50 h operation.Electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides to value-added chemicals is a promising strategy for mitigating the human-caused unbalance of the global nitrogen-cycle, but controlling product selectivity remains a great challenge.

        <p>T he nitrogen-cycle is vital for sustainability of the terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric ecosystems on Earth, and comprises the key stages of nitrogen fixation-nitrificationdenitrification 1 . However, the large-scale intensification of a fertiliser-dependent agriculture and the massive combustion of fossil fuels have significantly unbalanced Nature's nitrogencycle 2,3 . The anthropogenic inflow of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) leads to its fast accumulation, causing serious environmental and health problems 4,5 . Therefore, the electrocatalytic reduction of NO x from renewable energy is a promising strategy to bring the nitrogen-cycle back into balance 6 , alleviating NO x accumulation and at the same time producing useful chemicals.

        <p>In the series of nitrogen reduction steps starting from nitrate, the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) is a key step to allow for the further reduction of nitrogen, determining the nature of the further reduced nitrogen products (e.g., N 2 O, NO, NH 2 OH, and NH 3 ) 8,9 . Noble metal electrocatalysts such as Pt and Pd typically produce N 2 O/N 2 (low overpotential region) and NH 2 OH/NH 3 (high overpotential region) from the NO reduction reaction (NORR) 7,[9][10][11] . Meanwhile, some non-noble organometallic complexes (e.g., metallo-porphyrin/phthalocyanine (Pc) complexes, vitamin B 12 , and Prussian blue) catalyse the NORR primarily to NH 2 OH and NH 3 7,[12][13][14][15] . In contrast, heme proteins (e.g., myoglobin and haemoglobin) mainly produce N 2 O, in spite of their structurally similar active sites (i.e., Fe-N 4 core) 16,17 . This astounding difference in NORR selectivity despite similar core active site structure was also observed in biological systems. For instance, enzymatic NO reduction by cytochrome P450nor (single-heme) and nitrite reduction by cytochrome c′ nitrite reductase (multi-heme), despite identical NO-Fe II N 4 intermediate adduct structures, lead to N 2 O and NH 3 , respectively [18][19][20] .In the series of nitrogen reduction steps starting from nitrate, the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) is a key step to allow for the further reduction of nitrogen, determining the nature of the further reduced nitrogen products (e.g., N 2 O, NO, NH 2 OH, and NH 3 ) 8,9 .

        <p>Much effort has thus been devoted to identifying the physicochemical parameters that govern the NORR selectivity on single-site and metallic surfaces 11,[21][22][23][24][25] . Improved understanding on the NORR electrocatalysis by heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) has been reached via its controlled immobilisation on a graphite surface [21][22][23] . Two different NORR pathways were identified: pH-dependent (NH 2 OH formation) and pH-independent (N 2 O formation) pathways, the selectivity of which is affected by electrolyte pH, NO concentration, and electrode potential. By controlling these experimental parameters, highly selective NO-to-NH 2 OH conversion was also achieved with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup [21][22][23] . Along with the fundamental backgrounds, electrochemical NH 2 OH synthesis has also been demonstrated at device-level with catalysts incorporating heme-like moieties 7,[26][27][28] . Further progress is however still needed to improve its productivity and to secure operational durability for practical applications. For instance, unlike the broad range pH (2-12) typically applicable for half-cell studies 13,16,29,30 , NH 2 OH production at device-level (e.g., the H 2 -NO fuel cells) requires strongly acidic electrolytes (3-5 M, pH &lt; 0) to suppress a competitive N 2 O production 7,[26][27][28] . Although rapid catalytic deactivation would be expected due to the dissolution of the coordinated metal ion in such highly corrosive conditions [31][32][33] , catalytic stability for NORR has hitherto been underinvestigated 28 . Therefore, the development of new catalytic materials with high activity, selectivity, and stability is the next challenge for the success of NH 2 OH production from the artificial electrochemical denitrification.Much effort has thus been devoted to identifying the physicochemical parameters that govern the NORR selectivity on single-site and metallic surfaces 11,[21][22][23][24][25] .

        <p>Herein, we have studied the NORR electrocatalysis of a singleatom Fe catalyst, in which the heme-like active FeN x C y moieties are covalently bonded to the carbonaceous substrate (i.e., Fe-N-C catalyst). Because the FeN x C y moieties in this catalyst were shown to not suffer from strong Fe demetalation in the acidic electrolytes 34 , this well-defined catalyst has provided a suitable platform for both fundamental understandings and device-level operations of FeN x C y moieties under highly corrosive reaction conditions. The NORR selectivity and the nature of catalytic sites have been investigated by advanced ex/in situ analytical approaches combined with computational electrolyte-aware density functional theory (DFT) calculations and micro-kinetic modelling. Finally, we achieved effective and durable NH 2 OH production on the single-atom Fe catalyst in a prototypical H 2 -NO fuel cell reactor.Herein, we have studied the NORR electrocatalysis of a singleatom Fe catalyst, in which the heme-like active FeN x C y moieties are covalently bonded to the carbonaceous substrate (i.e., Fe-N-C catalyst).

        <p>Voltammetry of FeNC-dry-0.5 in NORR. The catalyst with single-atom Fe sites (labelled 'FeNC-dry-0.5') was synthesised by pyrolysis of Fe II acetate, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and Zn II zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The labelling refers to homogenised condition (i.e., ball-milling of 'dry' precursor powders) and Fe content in the precursor mixture before pyrolysis at 1323 K (see details in Methods section). As wellidentified in our previous works 35,36 , this catalyst is solely composed of isolated FeN x C y moieties (total Fe content ca. 1.5 wt%, no discernible Fe particles) conjugated on N-doped carbon substrate, as confirmed by a series of physical characterisation (see details in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. 12345). Especially, 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveal only two quadrupole doublets assigned to FeN x sites and Fe-N(O) interaction in FeN x sites, respectively, without any detectable spectroscopic signal from Fe clusters.Voltammetry of FeNC-dry-0.5 in NORR.

        <p>NORR electrocatalysis on the FeNC-dry-0.5 was measured in a NO-saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte. A linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) identifies two reduction waves (henceforth referred to as the 1st and 2nd reduction regions) before reaching an apparent diffusion-limited current density (j d ) of ca. 5.2 mA cm -2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 6). The profile of the polarisation curve seems to indicate that the reaction follows at least two different pathways depending on the applied potential, resulting in different products. NORR can result in four products, namely NH 3 (NH 4 + in acid), NH 2 OH (NH 3 OH + in acid), N 2 , and N 2 O (E 0 = 0.73, 0.38, 1.68, and 1.59 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively). In order to identify the gaseous products formed during NORR, online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) coupled with a scanning flow cell (SFC; Supplementary Fig. 7) was introduced. The result showed that NO dissolved in the electrolyte started being consumed at a potential below 0.6 V RHE (Fig. 1b), in line with the onset potential of NORR observed on the voltammetry (Fig. 1a). Concurrently, increasing N 2 O formation with decreasing potential was monitored, reaching a maximum at 0.3 V RHE (corresponding to the 1st reduction region in voltammetry) but thereafter decreasing for further decreasing potential, becoming hardly detectable below 0.1 V RHE . N 2 evolution was not discernable, while tiny level of H 2 byproduct could be seen at -0.2 V RHE . N 2 O formation at 0.5-0.15 V RHE was also observed by SFC/DEMS study with a potentiodynamic protocol (Supplementary Fig. 8). NORR in the 1st reduction region on FeNC-dry-0.5 was compared with that on polycrystalline Pt, known to selectively form N 2 O at low overpotential region 11,25,37 . Pt exhibits an onset potential of ca. 0.7 V RHE and a j d -value of ca. 1.8 mA cm -2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 6), corresponding to one-electron reduction of NO to N 2 O, independently confirmed by SFC/DEMS (Supplementary Fig. 9). Hence, similar values for the current density at ca. 0.2 V RHE on FeNC-dry-0.5 and for the well-defined j d observed on Pt, combined with the non-existence of other oneelectron reduction products of NO, indicate that NO-to-N 2 O conversion is the main NORR pathway on FeNC-dry-0.5 in the 1st reduction region.NORR electrocatalysis on the FeNC-dry-0.5 was measured in a NO-saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte.

        <p>Below 0.2 V RHE , however, the NORR current density (j) further increases on FeNC-dry-0.5 and the polarisation curve shows a well-defined plateau at &lt;0.05 V RHE (Fig. 1a). The j d value is ca. 5.2 (±0.2) mA cm -2 , which is approximately three times the j d value observed for Pt. This suggests that the main NORR product in this region is a three-electron reduction of NO (Supplementary Note 2), corresponding to NH 2 OH. To confirm this, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were carried out. The Pt ring oxidises both NH 2 OH and NO at &gt;0.9 V RHE (Supplementary Fig. 10), while NH 3 oxidation is almost inactive, in agreement with previous studies 21,22,38 . During LSV of the FeNC-dry-0.5 disk in the NO-saturated electrolyte, the Pt ring current (i) was recorded at a constant potential of 1.4 V RHE (Fig. 1c). The plateau of Pt ring current of ca. 0.55 mA at disk potentials &gt;0.6 V RHE (no NORR on FeNC-dry-0.5), is attributed to NO oxidation on the Pt ring. The ring current decreases when the disk potential is polarised within the 1st reduction region, due to NO consumption on the disk (i.e., NO-to-N 2 O conversion). When the disk potential is set within the 2nd reduction region, however, the Pt ring current increases again, reaching an absolute value even surpassing that observed when the NO concentration in the electrolyte is maximum (i.e., no NORR, &gt;0.6 V RHE ). This indicates that the NORR products formed on FeNC-dry-0.5 in the 2nd reduction region are oxidisable on the Pt ring, which according to the potential window should be associated with NH 2 OH rather than H 2 or N 2 O. Here, NO-to-N 2 H 4 conversion and its subsequent oxidation on the Pt ring could also be ruled out because of no considerable Pt ring current during the RRDE study performed at a Pt ring potential of 0.8 V RHE , at which only N 2 H 4 (not NO, NH 3 , and NH 2 OH) can be oxidised (Supplementary Fig. 10).Below 0.2 V RHE , however, the NORR current density (j) further increases on FeNC-dry-0.5 and the polarisation curve shows a well-defined plateau at &lt;0.05 V RHE (Fig. 1a). The j d value is ca. 5.2 (±0.2) mA cm -2 , which is approximately three times the j d value observed for Pt.

        <p>However, these analytical approaches failed to provide quantitative information in NORR selectivity because of the unknown number of electrons transferred during NH 2 OH oxidation on Pt. Thus, we compared LSV responses of the Pt ring with and without concurrent NORR on the FeNC-dry-0.5 disk (Fig. 1d) 21 . On the Pt ring, NO is reduced to N 2 O in 0.8-0.25 V RHE 25 , but reductions of other species (i.e., NH 2 OH and NH 3 ) are inactive (Supplementary Fig. 10). When the disk is polarised at 0.05 V RHE and consumes the NO, NO reduction current on the Pt ring decreases by ca. 0.08 mA due to consequent decrease in local concentration of NO at the ring electrode. Assuming 100% NH 2 OH selectivity on the FeNC-dry-0.5 disk, the current decrement corresponds to a collection efficiency of ca. 0.42 (Supplementary Note 3), which is in agreement with the value we calibrated (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, a series of SFC/DEMS and R(R)DE studies confirms that N 2 O and NH 2 OH are main products on the FeNC-dry-0.5 at the 1st and 2nd NORR regions, respectively.However, these analytical approaches failed to provide quantitative information in NORR selectivity because of the unknown number of electrons transferred during NH 2 OH oxidation on Pt.

        <p>Confirmation of the nature of the active site. To understand the nature of catalytic sites in NORR, we introduced a set of Fe-N-C catalysts comprising different contents of FeN x C y moieties and bulk Fe particles. The control catalysts were named 'FeNC-dry-1' and 'FeNC-wet-1', which were prepared as FeNC-dry-0.5 but with a two-fold higher Fe content in the precursor mixture and, for FeNC-wet-1, addition of a step for the aqueous complexation of Fe and phen, before milling the dried catalyst precursor (see details in Methods section) 35 . A distinct property of the control catalysts compared to FeNC-dry-0.5 is the presence of metallic iron and Fe 3 C (Supplementary Note 1). The quantitative analysis of their 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra identified that FeNC-dry-1 contains only ca. 0.2 wt% Fe particles and 2.8 wt% FeN x C y moieties while FeNC-wet-1 contains ca 1.2 wt% Fe particles and 2.2 wt% FeN x C y moieties (Supplementary Table 1). Due to the ability of Fe particles to catalyse graphitisation at the pyrolysis temperature, such Fe particles are surrounded by graphene shells (Supplementary Fig. 1), partially protecting them from immediate dissolution in acid medium. A N-doped carbon without any Fe intentionally added during synthesis (named 'NC') was also investigated as a third control.Confirmation of the nature of the active site.

        <p>LSV measurements for all the Fe-N-C catalysts revealed considerable NORR activity, while the NC produced a significantly lower current which did not reach the j d for N 2 O formation (i.e., ca. 1.8 mA cm -2 ) even at -0.2 V RHE (Fig. 2a). In addition, SFC/DEMS analysis showed N 2 O production on NC over the whole potential range, while it was limited to the 1st reduction region on all the Fe-N-C catalysts (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 8). Overall, this reveals that Fe plays a pivotal role in critically enhancing the NORR activity, enabling also the formation of highly reduced products such as NH 2 OH. Otherwise, comparable NORR polarisation curves among the all Fe-N-C catalysts suggest an insignificant catalytic role of Fe particles. From the high NORR activity of FeNC-dry-0.5 (solely consisted with FeN x C y moieties) and its significant deactivation in the presence of cyanide anion (Fig. 2a), the isolated Fe moieties were thus indicated as the main catalytic sites in NORR 39 .LSV measurements for all the Fe-N-C catalysts revealed considerable NORR activity, while the NC produced a significantly lower current which did not reach the j d for N 2 O formation (i.e., ca. 1.8 mA cm -2 ) even at -0.2 V RHE (Fig. 2a).

        <p>In addition, a potential-dependent shift in the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of FeNC-dry-0.5 was identified (Fig. 2c), similar to previous findings on other Fe-N-C catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) 40 . Coupled with voltammetric signals of electrochemical redox transition at ca. 0.6 V RHE (Supplementary Fig. 12), the spectral change refers to an average modification of the oxidation state from Fe III N x C y (for surface located moieties) to Fe II N x C y under NORR conditions, evidencing that the latter is the NORR active sites, similar as for molecular Fe catalysts 7,21,22,28 .In addition, a potential-dependent shift in the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of FeNC-dry-0.5 was identified (Fig. 2c), similar to previous findings on other Fe-N-C catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) 40 .

        <p>pH-dependence and product selectivity. Motivated from the pHdependent NORR selectivity of heme-immobilised electrode [21][22][23] , NORR electrocatalysis of FeNC-dry-0.5 under various pH conditions was investigated. At an electrolyte pH 0, the NORR polarisation is highly suppressed in the 1st reduction region (Fig. 2d). As the electrolyte pH increases, however, NORR in the 1st reduction region becomes magnified with a substantial activity decay in the 2nd reduction region. For a quantitative comparison, we depicted the NORR activity in each reduction region by the half-wave potentials (E 1/2 ; Supplementary Fig. 13), which were then plotted as a function of the electrolyte pH (Fig. 2e). On an RHE scale, a linear change of the E 1/2 value can be seen for the 1st reduction region with a slope of ca. 50 mV pH -1 , corresponding to a pH-independence of the NO-to-N 2 O pathway. In contrast, we found almost identical E 1/2 values in the 2nd reduction region (NO-to-NH 2 OH pathway) at pH 0 and 1, suggesting a Nernstian behaviour with a proton transfer (PT) to be limiting the conversion. This trend is qualitatively consistent with that on hemebased electrocatalysts [21][22][23] , showing pH-dependent/independent NORR to NH 2 OH/N 2 O, respectively.pH-dependence and product selectivity.

        <p>Along with the LSV data showing significant decrement of j d in the 2nd reduction region as the pH increases (pH 2 and 3 in particular; Fig. 2d), the negative slope suggests that decreased proton concentration significantly slows down the NO-to-NH 2 OH pathway beyond the expected Nernstian behaviour. This is supported by the SFC/DEMS study, showing almost no N 2 O signal at pH 0 throughout the entire potential range, but significant N 2 O signal over a broad potential range (even at -0.2 V RHE at pH 3) as the pH increases (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 14). This indicates unfavourable NH 2 OH formation at high pH. Therefore, it can be concluded that N 2 O and NH 2 OH productions compete in NORR electrocatalysis by FeNC-dry-0.5, and their selectivity is strongly influenced by both the electrode potential and the electrolyte pH.Along with the LSV data showing significant decrement of j d in the 2nd reduction region as the pH increases (pH 2 and 3 in particular; Fig. 2d), the negative slope suggests that decreased proton concentration significantly slows down the NO-to-NH 2 OH pathway beyond the expected Nernstian behaviour.

        <p>To understand the NORR mechanism, we performed advanced DFT calculations. For details, the reader is referred to Supplementary Note 4. In short, we relaxed several adsorbate geometries on the Generalised Gradient Approximation level using the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional 41 , where the effect of double-layer charging was included by means of an implicit solvent and a planar counter charge description for the Helmholtz layer (see Supplementary Fig. 15 for the optimised structures). This provided intermediate binding free energies as a function of surface charge density/potential (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 16 and17). Adsorption energies were further corrected by use of the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional (see Supplementary Note 4 including Supplementary Figs. 17-20 for a full sensitivity analysis of the functional choice) 42 , which were then employed to develop a micro-kinetic model for the prediction of polarisation curves as a function of pH (see details in Methods and Supplementary Note 4). The calculated partial current densities for producing NH 2 OH, N 2 O, and NH 3 at pH 0 and 3 are shown in Fig. 3a as a function of applied potential on an RHE scale (see also Supplementary Note 4 for a discussion of the kinetic model sensitivity including Supplementary Figs. 21 and22).

In addition, the in situ XANES measurement (Fig. 2c) indicated an oxidation state of 2+ for the Fe centre. Bader charge calculations showed that the partial charge of the Fe centre marginally varies upon charging the surface (Supplementary Fig. 24).

        <p>From micro-kinetic modelling and a degree of rate-control analysis (Supplementary Fig. 19), we found N 2 O production to be limited by Fe II -N 2 O 2 δ-formation. Previously, a decoupled electron transfer step to form NO -was suggested as ratedetermining step (RDS) for N 2 O production 22 . Electron transfer on conducting materials is, however, likely too fast to resemble a RDS 44 . Instead, we suggest here a modified scenario based on charge redistribution driven by double layer electric field interaction. At the potential of zero charge (PZC), we find the NO adsorbed to the iron centre is nearly neutral judging based on the Fe-N-O angle of 150°(Supplementary Fig. 24). In going to more negative potentials, however, the additional charge yields to a partially reduced NO (Supplementary Figs. 23 and24). In consistence with the previous understanding that NO -can easily form an N-N bond with another NO molecule 45 , NO coupling becomes energetically favourable when the system and consequently also the NO is more negatively charged [46][47][48] . This leads to an inversion of relative energies of the Fe II -NO δ-state and the Fe II -N 2 O 2 δ-state (Supplementary Fig. 16).From micro-kinetic modelling and a degree of rate-control analysis (Supplementary Fig. 19), we found N 2 O production to be limited by Fe II -N 2 O 2 δ-formation.

        <p>To support this mechanism, we performed in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) studies (Fig. 3e-g and Supplementary Fig. 25). The ATR-SEIRAS spectra identified two main bands at ca. 1723 (the high frequency NO; NO High ) and 1685 cm -1 (the low frequency NO; NO Low ) at -0.2 V RHE (Fig. 3e), both of which showed a Stark effect with the slope of ca. 50 cm -1 V -1 . In addition, the positions of both bands were unchanged by solvent isotope labelling (in H 2 O and D 2 O solutions; Fig. 3f), indicating that these bands are associated with nonprotonated species. IR bands of organometallic Fe-porphyrin complexes observed at ca. 1700 cm -1 have usually been assigned to the Fe(η 1 -NO), where NO is bonded to Fe via nitrogen 49,50 . Thus, we assigned these to the adsorbed NO species on the Fe centre, i.e., Fe II -NO δ-. Also, considering the high sensitivity of the NO vibration frequency to the local chemical environment [51][52][53] , the presence of two separate bands implies that there exist (at least) two chemically inequivalent Fe II -NO δ-species. However, these bands are separated by only ca. 40 cm -1 , and no appreciable signal was shown below 1600 cm -1 . Thus, the possibility of different binding modes such as η 1 -ON and η 2 -NO could reasonably be excluded 54 . Instead, slightly more reduced NO forming a more bent Fe-N-O geometry may explain the band at the lower frequency (NO Low ). Furthermore, the integrated peak intensities of both bands increased with decreasing an applied bias, inferring the increase of more Fe II -NO δ-species at lower potential (Fig. 3g). Thus, the key intermediate of Fe II -NO δ-, which is predicted to exist with a high coverage below 0.2 V RHE (Supplementary Fig. 19), is spectroscopically confirmed.To support this mechanism, we performed in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) studies (Fig. 3e-g and Supplementary Fig. 25).

        <p>Since the formation of Fe II -N 2 O 2 δ-does not involve a PT, it is pH-independent on a SHE scale (Supplementary Fig. 21). On an RHE scale, we thus saw the expected Nernstian overpotential shift of ca. 59 mV × ΔpH = 178 mV when going from pH 0 to 3 (Fig. 3a), in agreement with the experimental results in the 1st reduction region (Fig. 2e). The production of NH 2 OH and NH 3 , however, is limited by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step to Fe II -NO δ-(Supplementary Fig. 19), and thus showed a strong pH-dependence on an SHE scale (Supplementary Fig. 21). Interestingly, however, we found the pH-induced overpotential shift to be larger than the expected 178 mV. In consequence, even after correcting for this shift by plotting the data on an RHE scale (Fig. 3a), we still observed a decrease of the reaction rate with increasing pH.Since the formation of Fe II -N 2 O 2 δ-does not involve a PT, it is pH-independent on a SHE scale (Supplementary Fig. 21).

        <p>Such a non-Nernstian behaviour is originated from differences in the surface charge dependence of intermediate binding energies (Supplementary Fig. 16). At a higher pH (for a fixed potential on RHE scale), the corresponding potential in the SHE scale is more negative, which increases the surface charge. The stronger stabilisation of Fe II -NO δ-with negative charge relative to the following Fe II -NHO δ-state (Supplementary Fig. 16), increases the overall reaction barrier at fixed RHE potential (Fig. 3c). This super-Nernstian decrease of the reaction rate with increasing pH explains the experimentally observed pH dependence (Fig. 2e) and underlines the role of surface charge in controlling product selectivity.Such a non-Nernstian behaviour is originated from differences in the surface charge dependence of intermediate binding energies (Supplementary Fig. 16).

        <p>We further elucidate that the redox non-innocent property of nitrosyl ligand originates the particularly strong surface charge stabilisation of the NO* intermediate. With changing the redox state of nitrosyl ligand from NO + to NO to NO -, the metal-N-O angle is known to vary from the linear geometry (as stabilised by the π-back bond; Supplementary Fig. 26) to the bent geometry (as stabilised by the σ-forward bond; Fig. 3d (RPBE) and Supplementary Fig. 27 (HSE06)) 55 . When the surface is negatively charged, the Fermi energy increases and the occupation of the NO π* orbital also increases, yielding an enhanced NO - character as evidenced from the decrease in Fe-N-O angle (Supplementary Fig. 24). At higher cathodic overpotential, thus, the nitrosyl ligand becomes more reduced, and thus more effectively stabilised by forming the stronger Fe-N σ-forward bond. This results in the surface charge dependence of the Fe II -NO δ-intermediate, yielding the super-Nernstian behaviour during NH 2 OH production.We further elucidate that the redox non-innocent property of nitrosyl ligand originates the particularly strong surface charge stabilisation of the NO* intermediate.

        <p>Additionally, it is important to mention that the presence of a finite surface charge does not always stabilise the adsorbate states (Supplementary Fig. 16). As an example, unlikely to the Fe II -NO δ- state, the Fe II -NH 3 state has an anti-bonding singly occupied (highest) MO (SOMO) (Supplementary Fig. 28). Filling of this SOMO results in a destabilisation at more negative potentials. This indicates that charge stabilisation is a complex function of the electronic structure of adsorption states, and thus a quantum- mechanical level of simulation reflecting the finite bias potential effect is a necessity for a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism.Additionally, it is important to mention that the presence of a finite surface charge does not always stabilise the adsorbate states (Supplementary Fig. 16).

To confirm the NH 2 OH production in a fuel cell with FeNC-dry-0.5, a Htype flow cell with gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) was employed as a prototype reactor (Supplementary Fig. 29). An Ar-saturated 1 M HClO 4 electrolyte was introduced into the cathode compartment, directly connected to ion chromatography (IC) for online monitoring of NH 3 and NH 2 OH production. NH 2 OH production is detected at a cell voltage (V cell ) below 0.17 V (E cathode = 0.2 V RHE ), and its Faradaic efficiency (FE NH2OH ) reaches 60-70% as V cell further decreases (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 30).

However, the overall FE of NH 2 OH and NH 3 is lower than 75%.

Meanwhile, a fully wetted catalyst layer (i.e., decrement in its hydrophobicity) and small leakage of electrolyte through the GDE were found after the durability test (Supplementary Fig. 34).

        <p>In summary, we presented a novel single-atom Fe catalyst for efficient NH 2 OH production from electrochemical NO reduction. By performing detailed electrochemical analysis, we identified the catalytic site to be electrogenerated Fe II N x C y moieties. From a combination of in operando spectroscopy and electrochemical hybrid-level DFT-based multiscale modelling, we further obtained full mechanistic details about the NH 2 OH and N 2 O production pathways and their pH dependence. Further, we revealed an intriguing super-Nernstian pH dependence of the NH 2 OH pathway which originates from the redox non-innocent character of NO. The resulting surface charge sensitivity of the Fe II -NO δ-state leads to an increased sensitivity to the overpotential changes that occur by varying the pH conditions. We then finally validated the potential of practical NO-to-NH 2 OH conversion on the isolated FeN x C y moieties also in a fuel cell device showing unprecedented long-term stability and performance. Along with the obtained detailed mechanistic insights, which will be invaluable for the development of future NO reduction catalysts, the presented excellent performance metrics in device-level will provide an important stepping stone towards the technological development of fully sustainable electrosynthesis of valued nitrogen products from electrochemical nitrate/nitrite denitrification, which is environmentally vital for balancing the disturbed global nitrogen-cycle.In summary, we presented a novel single-atom Fe catalyst for efficient NH 2 OH production from electrochemical NO reduction.

From a combination of in operando spectroscopy and electrochemical hybrid-level DFT-based multiscale modelling, we further obtained full mechanistic details about the NH 2 OH and N 2 O production pathways and their pH dependence. Further, we revealed an intriguing super-Nernstian pH dependence of the NH 2 OH pathway which originates from the redox non-innocent character of NO. The resulting surface charge sensitivity of the Fe II -NO δ-state leads to an increased sensitivity to the overpotential changes that occur by varying the pH conditions. We then finally validated the potential of practical NO-to-NH 2 OH conversion on the isolated FeN x C y moieties also in a fuel cell device showing unprecedented long-term stability and performance.

        <p>Catalyst synthesis. FeNC-dry-0.5 and FeNC-dry-1 catalysts were prepared from the Fe II acetate (95%, Sigma-Aldrich), phen (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and ZIF-8 (ZnN 4 C 8 H 12 , Basolite Z1200 from BASF) 36 . The precursor mixture (1 g), containing 0.5 and 1.0 wt% Fe with a mass ratio phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80, was homogenised by dry ball-milling. The milling was conducted in a ZrO 2 crucible with 100 ZrO 2 balls (5 mm diameter) using a planetary ball-miller (FRITSCH Pulverisette 7 Premium) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. The resulting catalyst precursor was pyrolysed at 1323 K in Ar (5N, Daedeok) for 1 h, leading to FeNC-dry-0.5 and FeNC-dry-1. FeNC-wet-1 catalyst was prepared identically to the FeNC-dry-1 except for the addition of wet-impregnation step before the homogenised process 35 . Catalyst precursors were dissolved in a mixture of ethanol/water solution (1/2 vol. ratio) to form Fe(phen) 3 complex. Precursor powder gathered by the solvent evaporation was then ball-milled and pyrolysed, yielding FeNC-wet-1 after acid-washing with pH 1 H 2 SO 4 . The Fe content in the catalysts after pyrolysis was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (NexION I, Perki-nElmer), and found to be ca. 1.5, 3.0, and 3.4 wt% for FeNC-dry-0.5, FeNC-dry-1, FeNC-wet-1, respectively. Active site density of FeNC-dry-0.5 estimated with the in situ nitrite poisoning method 60 . For the synthesis of NC catalyst, free of Fe species, the precursor powder composed of phen and ZIF-8 (without Fe II acetate), was dry ball-milled and pyrolysed as methods for the dry Fe-N-C catalysts. Due to trace amount of Fe impurity in the commercial ZIF-8 (&gt;100 ppm) 61 , Fe-free ZIF-8, synthesised by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt) in aqueous solution (molar ratio, Zn salt : 2-MeIm:water = 1:60:2228) 62 , was used for the NC preparation.Catalyst synthesis.

Graphite rod and saturated Ag/AgCl (RE-1A, EC-Frontier) electrodes were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg catalyst in Nafion solution (2713 μL water, 221 μL isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 50 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%)). The homogenised catalyst ink (15 μL) was drop-casted on glassy carbon (GC, 0.126 cm 2 ) of working electrode (012613, ALS). The ink on the electrode was dried at room temperature and the resulting loading amount was ca. 200 μg cm -2 . For a comparison, a commercial polycrystalline Pt electrode (0.07 cm 2 , 011170, ALS) was employed. Before the electrochemical experiments, the reference electrode was calibrated against a Pt electrode in a H 2 -saturated (5N, Daedeok) electrolyte to correctly convert potentials to the RHE scale. Reference electrode was doubly separated with a glass bridge tube to avoid the halogen contamination. In general, 0.1 M HClO 4 (pH 1) solution was used as an electrolyte, which was prepared from ultrapure water (&gt;18.2 MΩ, Arium ® mini, Sartorius) and concentrated HClO 4 (70%, Sigma-Aldrich). For the studies about the pH effects, 1 M (pH 0), 0.01 M (pH 2), and 0.001 M (pH 3) HClO 4 electrolytes were employed, after adjusting the ionic strength to 0.1 M with a KClO 4 salt (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) for pH 2 and 3 due to their poor ionic conductivity. After deaeration by Ar-bubbling, the electrolyte was saturated with NO gas (3N, Daedeok), the possible NO 2 impurity of which was removed by two glass bubblers filled with a 4 M KOH (85%, Daejung) solution 21 .

Before the single-cell operations, retention time and concentration of NH 3 OH + and NH 4 + were calibrated with standard HClO 4 solutions dissolving 0-0.5 mM NH 2 OH/NH 3 mixtures. The IC data were analysed by using the

        <p>Computational methods. DFT calculations of reaction energetics were carried out with a periodic plane-wave implementation and ultra-soft pseudo-potentials using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO version 6.1 on a single Fe-N 4 moiety embedded into a graphene unit cell 64 . The self-consistent continuum solvation implicit solvation model as implemented in the Environ QUANTUM ESPRESSO module was used to model the presence of implicit water 65 . The surface charge density was modulated by changing the total charge of the system and a planar counter charge was introduced above the slab to compensate the charge 48,65,66 . The relaxed surface states were also re-calculated using the Vienna Abinito Simulation Package as spinpolarised single point calculations using the RPBE+U and HSE06 functionals 42 . Assuming a constant double layer capacitance C dl (ca. 20 μF cm -2 for graphene) 67,68 , the surface charge density σ is generated according to σ = C dl (E -E PZC ), where E is the applied electrode potential and E PZC is the PZC which we measured here to be ca. 0 V SHE (Supplementary Fig. 35). PCET steps were described based on the computational hydrogen electrode and electrochemical barriers were estimated from the reversible potentials of each elementary reaction step 69,70 .
