        <p>An optimized dense convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (DenseNet) for corn leaf disease recognition and classification is proposed in this paper. Corn is one of the most cultivated grain throughout the world. Corn crops are highly susceptible to certain leaf diseases such as corn common rust, corn gray leaf spot, and northern corn leaf blight are very common. Symptoms of these leaf diseases are not differentiable in their nascent stages. Hence, the current research presents a solution through deep learning so that crop health can be monitored and, it will lead to an increase in the quantity as well as the quality of crop production. The proposed optimized DenseNet model has achieved an accuracy of 98.06%. Besides, it uses significantly lesser parameters as compared to the various existing CNN such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net, NASNet, and Xception Net. The performance of the optimized DenseNet model has been contrasted with the current CNN architectures by considering two (time and accuracy) quality measures. This study indicates that the performance of the optimized DenseNet model is close to that of the established CNN architectures with far fewer parameters and computation time.An optimized dense convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (DenseNet) for corn leaf disease recognition and classification is proposed in this paper.

        <p>The agriculture sector is adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning in diverse areas including disease detection, soil monitoring, weed controlling, diagnosing pests, computer vision and drones for crop analysis, and weather predictions. Agriculture is the most important sector of the Indian economy, accounting for 18% of its GDP [1]. The main source of income for a large population of India is agriculture. Hence, India is extremely dependent on crop productivity.The agriculture sector is adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning in diverse areas including disease detection, soil monitoring, weed controlling, diagnosing pests, computer vision and drones for crop analysis, and weather predictions.

        <p>Corn is a very common crop in India. Corn farming is essential in India because it has a high export potential and a vast population of farmers is dependent on it [2,3]. Corn is being used in various sectors like cattle feed, poultry industry and food and beverage industries. It has become a primary food in many parts of the world, with its overall production exceeding that of wheat and rice. But in India, the yield of corn is almost half of the overall global average [2]. One of the reasons for low corn yield is that it is subjected to many diseases which significantly reduce the overall crop yield. Certain leaf diseases remain a challenge for crop production, not only through scaling down the crop yield but also through the reduction in its nutritional value. Some of the prevalent leaf diseases include common rust, gray leaf spot, and leaf blight.Corn is a very common crop in India.

        <p>These leaf diseases may look very comparable in their nascent phases, hence making it very difficult to detect through the naked eye. Detection of leaf diseases through visual observation requires a team of specialists and constant crop monitoring [4]. Thus, making it very costly, time-consuming and less reliable. We can leverage deep learning techniques to conduct automatic, rapid and more precise leaf disease detection and classification. Several researchers have worked in this region to create a model that can predict the existence of leaf disease in corn plants. We examine some of these researches in the following paragraphs.These leaf diseases may look very comparable in their nascent phases, hence making it very difficult to detect through the naked eye.

        <p>Zhang et al. [5] proposed an improved SVM called genetic algorithm support vector machine (GA-SVM). The author collected and classified six types of corn leaf diseases. The following steps were carried out to classify the diseases: For image processing, the JPEG images were transformed into BMP format. Furthermore, the images were converted from RGB template to HSI, to extract various features (average and standard deviations of R, G, B and shape features such as area, circumference, circularity, height, and width, etc). Then segmentation was implemented to get binary images. Finally, the technique of Orthogonal rotation was used to obtain appropriate parameters for the genetic algorithm. Twenty feature parameters were fed to the model. For classification comparisons between SVM and GA-SVM, four kernels were selected: linear, polynomial, RBF and sigmoid. The author concluded after comparison that GA-SVM has a higher classification rate (between 69.63% -90.09% for SVM and between 88.72% -92.59% for GA-SVM).Zhang et al.

Durga and Anuradha [8] used SVM and ANN algorithm for leaf disease classification in tomato and corn plants. Image dataset included 200 pictures with a collection of healthy leaves and diseased leaves like northern leaf blight, common rust, bacterial spot, tomato mosaic virus, etc. They used the following steps to identify the diseases: the RGB picture was converted to the grayscale picture and the image was then segmented by calculating the intensity gradient at each pixel. For feature extraction, HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) procedure was used. The extracted features were fed to the SVM and ANN classifier models.

        <p>Bhatt and Sarangai [9] developed a system for the identification of corn leaf diseases using CNN architectures (VGG16, inception-v2, ResNet50, mobileNet-v1) and applied a combination of adaptive boosting with decision tree-based classifier to distinguish between diseases that appeared to be similar. Four categories of image data included healthy leaves, common rust, leaf blight, and leaf spot. Pictures of each class were taken from PlantVillage dataset. The pictures were resized for image preprocessing according to the necessity of the CNN model used. Features derived from the CNN models were fed to the classifiers (softmax, support vector machine and random forest). It was observed that inception-v2 gave the highest precision with random forest. From the confusion matrix of each classifier, the author noted that leaf blight and leaf spot classes were difficult to differentiate. Therefore, to increase the classification accuracy between them, the Adaptive boosting technique was applied to the best performing model (based on Inception-v2 and RF).

        <p>These studies have shown good results but on small image dataset with an increase in parameters or computation time, which has an adverse effect on recognition performance. Also, some methods defined above involve machine learning techniques for feature extraction and classification of corn leaf diseases with the help of SVM, ANN, random forest and so on. For image processing in machine learning, the researcher needs to extract the features manually in an image and feed them to the classification model. These workflows are very complicated, challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, the objective of this research is to improve the conventional methods of identification and to present an optimized model for corn leaf disease identification with lesser parameters and computation time.These studies have shown good results but on small image dataset with an increase in parameters or computation time, which has an adverse effect on recognition performance.

        <p>For image recognition, models should have a lot of prior knowledge to make up for all the data that we don't have. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one such class [10,11,12,13], but established CNN architectures give a high-performance rate with many parameters or high convergence time. By altering their depth and breadth, their capacity can be regulated, and mostly they make the right assumptions about the nature of images. CNN's, therefore, have much fewer links and parameters and are simpler to train as compared to normal neural networks [10].For image recognition, models should have a lot of prior knowledge to make up for all the data that we don't have.

        <p>We have been studying that the most efficient way of enhancing the performance of neural networks is by expanding their depth and width, but a recent study shows that once the network reaches a saturation point, scaling up the depth and width might cause an increase in error rate [33]. Moreover, scaling up the depth and width has two other main challenges. The first challenge that occurs with bigger networks is many parameters that makes the network more likely to overfit [14]. Another challenge is that increasing the size of the network increases the use of computational resources. Since the computational budget is usually finite, we need a systematic distribution of computing resources [14].We have been studying that the most efficient way of enhancing the performance of neural networks is by expanding their depth and width, but a recent study shows that once the network reaches a saturation point, scaling up the depth and width might cause an increase in error rate [33].

            <rs type="software">VGGNet</rs> have been substituted with consecutive layers of 3x3 convolutions with ReLU in between. The convolutional stride was fixed to 1 pixel. The padding of convolution layer input was maintained as 1 pixel and max-pooling was done with a stride of 2 over a 2 × 2-pixel window [17]. The pile of convolutional layers was joined with 3 fully connected layers and one softmax layer. 
            <rs type="software">VGGNet</rs> has 144 million parameters, of which approximately 124 million are used in the last 3 Fully Connected layers. Therefore, if the fully connected layers could be eliminated, the architecture efficiency could be enhanced. This step was taken in subsequent architectures replacing the first Fully Connected layer with a node layer using a method called average pooling [18]. The architecture of 
            <rs type="software">VGGNet</rs> (VGG16) is shown in Figure 1[36]. The main hallmark of the inception network was to utilize computing resources inside the network. It eliminates all the fully connected layers and uses average pooling, therefore, the system has only 5 million parameters [18].

NASNET achieved an 82.7 percent top-1 and 96.2 percent top-5 state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet.

        <p>Problems arise with the CNNs as they get deeper because the route from the input layer to the output layer becomes so large that when it hits the other side of the network, the backpropagating gradient disappears. This vanishing gradient issue was resolved in ResNet [29] architecture by introducing skip connections between layers that add outputs from prior layers to stacked layers' outputs. ResNets shortened the stochastic depth [30] of the network by dropping some random layers during training which allowed better gradient and information flow. Thus, increasing the ability to train deeper networks. Unlike ResNets, DenseNets [24] links all layers to each other directly and ensures an optimal flow of information within the layers with a simple connectivity pattern. Rather than adding the residual, as in ResNet, all the feature maps are concatenated by the DenseNet. Therefore, they can be deeper than normal networks and can be readily optimized with this fresh residual usage. With very less parameters, this new CNN architecture has achieved state-of-the-art results on datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet). DenseNets have two main advantages: 1) Parameter Efficiency 2) Deep Supervision. This network has fewer parameters than standard networks because firstly it generates feature maps with a tiny growth rate (the total output feature maps of a layer is growth rate) and secondly it applies a 1×1 convolution as a bottleneck layer before each 3×3 convolution to reduce the number of input feature maps [24]. Lastly, extreme residual usage produces deep supervision as each layer in DenseNet receives more supervision from the loss function due to the shorter links.Problems arise with the CNNs as they get deeper because the route from the input layer to the output layer becomes so large that when it hits the other side of the network, the backpropagating gradient disappears.

Unlike ResNets, DenseNets [24] links all layers to each other directly and ensures an optimal flow of information within the layers with a simple connectivity pattern. Rather than adding the residual, as in ResNet, all the feature maps are concatenated by the DenseNet. Therefore, they can be deeper than normal networks and can be readily optimized with this fresh residual usage. With very less parameters, this new CNN architecture has achieved state-of-the-art results on datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet). DenseNets have two main advantages: 1) Parameter Efficiency 2) Deep Supervision. This network has fewer parameters than standard networks because firstly it generates feature maps with a tiny growth rate (the total output feature maps of a layer is growth rate) and secondly it applies a 1×1 convolution as a bottleneck layer before each 3×3 convolution to reduce the number of input feature maps [24]. Lastly, extreme residual usage produces deep supervision as each layer in DenseNet receives more supervision from the loss function due to the shorter links.</p>
        <p>DenseNet is made by connecting multiple dense blocks. A dense block is a set of layers that are attached to all its former layers. One layer in the dense block is composed of 4 layers: 1) Batch Normalization 2) ReLU activation 3) 3x3 convolution 4) Dropout.

        <p>Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) [32] is a technique used for stochastic optimization. It evaluates adaptive learning rates for distinct parameters. This optimizer brings together the benefits of two latest optimizers, i.e. AdaGrad [35] and RMSProp to provide a technique for handling noisy issues with sparse gradients. It is easy to implement, works efficiently, has fewer memory requirements, invariant to the rescaling of gradient and works with sparse gradients. Adam uses the average of the second-order gradients rather than using the learning rates based on the average of the first moments. It specifically calculates the gradient and the squared gradient as an exponential moving average. Most of the features for the real time datasets are sparse due to which the corresponding gradient for most instances could be zero and therefore the parameters update is also zero hence we will not proceed the learning. In order to respond to this problem, the learning rate should be adaptive to relatively sparse data. The Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam optimization algorithms are based on adaptive learning rates. In Adagrad the learning rate decays aggressively and RMSProp has high number of oscillations which might delay the convergence, so the best choice is Adam which overcomes both problems. Algorithm 1 presents the Adam optimizer used in this study. • α :Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) [32] is a technique used for stochastic optimization.

        <p>Deep learning models perform better when the size of the dataset is large hence to achieve this, we expanded the dataset by creating artificial samples from existing samples. The technique of creating artificial samples from existence samples by varying orientations of original samples is called data augmentation. Data augmentation allows programmers to considerably enhance the diversity and eventually the size of data available to train the models [28]. It is a known fact that CNN can handle variations in image and classify items even when they are positioned in distinct orientations [43] [44]. This is fundamentally the premise of data augmentation. To train CNN, substantial data is required so that it can learn and extract more features. The data collection process is associated with a cost that can be in terms of money, human effort, computational resources, and time consumption. Therefore, one may need to augment the existing data by making some minor alterations to images like scaling, rotating, translating, etc. The advantage of generating a greater number of training examples is that it makes the model more robust and generalized; thereby improving its accuracy. All images in the dataset are subject to several steps of data augmentation. 4. Besides, it can be seen that the classes 0 and 3 are overlapping the most. Therefore, we can say that it is difficult to distinguish between Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot and Northern_Leaf_Blight classes. A comprehensive classification reported has been prepared and drafted and in the Table 5.Deep learning models perform better when the size of the dataset is large hence to achieve this, we expanded the dataset by creating artificial samples from existing samples.
