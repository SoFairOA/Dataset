        <p>Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) able to work in acidic working conditions are elusive. While many first-row transition metal oxides are competitive in alkaline media, most of them just dissolve or become inactive at high proton concentrations where hydrogen evolution is preferred. Only noble-metal catalysts, such as IrO 2 , are fast and stable enough in acidic media. Herein, we report the excellent activity and long-term stability of Co 3 O 4 -based anodes in 1 M H 2 SO 4 (pH 0.1) when processed in a partially hydrophobic carbon-based protecting matrix. These Co 3 O 4 @C composites reliably drive O 2 evolution a 10 mA cm -2 current density for &gt;40 h without appearance of performance fatigue, successfully passing benchmarking protocols without incorporating noble metals. Our strategy opens an alternative venue towards fast, energy efficient acid-media water oxidation electrodes.Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) able to work in acidic working conditions are elusive.

        <p>Hydrogen is considered the most environmentally friendly alternative fuel to replace traditional fossil energy 1,2 . However, hydrogen production is still dominated worldwide by natural gas steam reforming, a mature technology fixing a very low competitive price in the market. Electrochemical water splitting powered by renewable sources is regarded as the ideal future technology to produce hydrogen, but costs must be lowered to improve its market penetration 3,4 . The catalysts responsible to improve the efficiency of the process, mainly relying on noble metals, are part of the high cost of the technology, and because of this, many laboratories in the world are working to find viable solutions to develop effective, earth-abundant, robust and scalable catalyst [5][6][7][8] . Acidic electrolytes offer many advantages for hydrogen production, given that high H + concentration improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and also facilitates fast/low resistance ionic transport 9,10 . Several electrocatalysts based on low-cost raw materials have shown great promise to substitute the state-of-the-art platinum electrodes responsible for HER 6,7,[11][12][13][14] . On the contrary, no viable candidates are known to substitute noble-metal oxides such as IrO 2 at the anode where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place 1,6,9,[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] . So far, no stable and inexpensive OER catalysts can work under high potential and/or current densities in acidic media, where even the highly active RuO 2 presents serious deactivation problems 22,23 .Hydrogen is considered the most environmentally friendly alternative fuel to replace traditional fossil energy 1,2 .

        <p>Several strategies have been proposed to promote OER at high proton concentration [24][25][26][27][28] . One strategy deals with the investigation of ternary/complex oxide structures such as nickel-manganese antimonate. This rutile-type oxide was stable for 168 h at 10 mA cm -2 operating in 1 M sulfuric acid, although with the penalty of requiring a large overpotential (η ≥ 700 mV) 26 . Cobalt-doped hematite thin-film electrocatalysts were also able to sustain a geometric current density of 10 mA cm -2 for up to 50 h at pH 0.1, but again at large overpotentials (η ≥ 650 mV) 27 . Indeed, cobalt oxides have shown promising OER electrocatalysis in acidic media, although highly limited by its redox potential-dependent instability, since CoO x may rapidly dissolve either at open circuit conditions or under high applied potentials [29][30][31][32] . Some interesting advances in long-term stability were achieved by doping or processing techniques [33][34][35] .Several strategies have been proposed to promote OER at high proton concentration [24][25][26][27][28] .

        <p>In our previous work with polyoxometalate (POM)-supported catalysts, we disclosed how these molecular catalysts showed promising OER catalytic performance in acidic conditions when incorporating active Co centers 36 . The high activity of these catalysts, even in heterogeneous conditions, was achieved thanks to the synergic stability offered by a partially hydrophobic carbon-based support. However, this strategy was not successful to achieve longterm stability, since these POM-based electrodes could only survive at low current densities and for a very limited time, given their intrinsic instability to the mechanical stress provoked by gas bubbling.In our previous work with polyoxometalate (POM)-supported catalysts, we disclosed how these molecular catalysts showed promising OER catalytic performance in acidic conditions when incorporating active Co centers 36 .

        <p>In this work, we present a promising processing protocol, which combines in one single anode two powerful strategies: (i) the incorporation of a nanostructured OER catalyst from earth-abundant metals to maximize active surface area, (ii) supported by a conducting, partially hydrophobic binder made from paraffin oil and graphite powder. Our processing protocol with nitrogen-doped carbon-coated Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles (Co 3 O 4 @C) delivers robust and scalable anodes that exhibit excellent acidic OER performances, needing a minimum overpotential (η ≤ 398 mV) to maintain a 10 mA cm -2 current density for &gt;40 h when working in 1 M sulfuric acid solution, without any sign of fatigue or deactivation. The high activity and also great stability demonstrate a performance superior to any other non-noble catalysts reported. Oxygen evolution quantification confirms the Faradaic efficiency (&gt;96%) of these electrodes towards OER, with negligible participation of other oxidation processes. These results open alternative opportunities for stable OER electrocatalysis with earth-abundant raw materials.In this work, we present a promising processing protocol, which combines in one single anode two powerful strategies: (i) the incorporation of a nanostructured OER catalyst from earth-abundant metals to maximize active surface area, (ii) supported by a conducting, partially hydrophobic binder made from paraffin oil and graphite powder.

        <p>The overall synthetic and processing protocol is summarized in Fig. 1. We synthesized carbon-coated Co (Co@C) nanoparticles, starting from the thermal treatment of Co(bIm) 2 (bIm = 2-benzimidazolate), a metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor (ZIF-9) 37 . Then Co@C was oxidized at low-temperature to achieve its full transformation into cobalt oxide nanoparticles, covered by an amorphous, nitrogendoped-carbon coating derived from the organic skeleton (Co 3 O 4 @C, Fig. 1). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and Raman spectra confirmed the presence of a Co 3 O 4 phase and the carbon support (Supplementary Figs. 1234). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy the presence of graphitic-like nanostructures all around the sample, embedding the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Some of these C-nanostructures had a nanosheet-like morphology (Fig. 2), while some others were folded forming onion-like rings around the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 5). Electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning TEM mode (EELS-STEM) confirmed the chemical composition of the nanoparticles and surrounding nanostructures (Supplementary Fig. 6). The Co 3 O 4 @C composition was determined as (Co 3 O 4 )(H 2 O) 0.30 (OH) 0.85 C 2.00 N 0.05 by thermogravimetry elemental analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 1).The overall synthetic and processing protocol is summarized in Fig. 1.

        <p>For the preparation of the electrode composites, Co 3 O 4 @C was mixed with graphite (G) and paraffin oil (PO) in the desired ratio (see Methods section) to prepare a homogeneous composite (Co 3 O 4 @C/ GPO) with the desired Co 3 O 4 @C content up to 40% (40-Co 3 O 4 @C). Composites above 40% were mechanically too fragile for further processing into the working electrode pocket. HRTEM images and EELS-STEM maps showed similar nanostructures within Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO and close contact between Co 3 O 4 @C and GPO (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 8). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed to further identify the surface chemical composition and the mixed oxidation state Co 2+/3+ (Supplementary Fig. 9) consistent with the presence of the Co 3 O 4 , as confirmed by PXRD and HR-TEM data 38 . XPS spectra from the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO composite show no differences respect to the Co 3 O 4 @C precursor, demonstrating the absence of chemical modification during composite preparation.For the preparation of the electrode composites, Co 3 O 4 @C was mixed with graphite (G) and paraffin oil (PO) in the desired ratio (see Methods section) to prepare a homogeneous composite (Co 3 O 4 @C/ GPO) with the desired Co 3 O 4 @C content up to 40% (40-Co 3 O 4 @C).

        <p>The x-Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO composites (x corresponds to the % in weight for the metal oxide) were inserted into the pocket of a working electrode and used as anode during electrochemical water oxidation in 1 M H 2 SO 4 (pH ≈ 0.1). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed the appearance of a catalytic current density on the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrode at relatively low overpotentials, which was sustained after successive cycling curves (Supplementary Figs. 10 and11). Comparative linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed an enhanced electrochemical activity upon increasing Co 3 O 4 @C content, reaching a very low onset overpotential (η onset = 194 ± 4 mV) for the 40-Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrode (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 12). These electrodes reach 10 mA cm -2 currents at just 360 ± 4 mV overpotential. Interestingly, no sign of a transportlimited regime appeared in the studied potential range, reaching over 20 mA cm -2 at η = 397 ± 4 mV.

        <p>We prepared analogous IrO 2 /GPO working electrodes to benchmark our results in the same conditions with the state-of-theart IrO 2 . The IrO 2 /GPO anodes delivered higher overpotentials, η j = 10mAcm À2 = 368 mV at 10 mA cm -2 and η j = 20mAcm À2 = 396 mV at 20 mA cm -2 , slightly above those obtained for the Co 3 O 4 @C-based electrode (Supplementary Table 2).We prepared analogous IrO 2 /GPO working electrodes to benchmark our results in the same conditions with the state-of-theart IrO 2 .

        <p>Tafel analyses of the LSV data yielded slopes of 143 mV dec -1 for Co 3 O 4 @C and 82 mV dec -1 for IrO 2 (Fig. 3c), suggesting a different reaction mechanism (rate-limiting step) for these two catalysts, and indicating a faster increment of current density with the applied potential for IrO 2 39,40 . Interestingly, this is compensated by the lower onset potential of Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) of Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO and IrO 2 /GPO were calculated as 25 and 2 mF cm -2 , respectively, with 0.03 mF cm -2 for the blank GPO (Supplementary Fig. 13). This indicates a greater electrochemical active surface area for Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO, due to its higher density of active sites in Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO, thanks to its nanostructuration, favouring the higher current densities observed in the potential range studied 41,42 . It is important to point out that nanostructured IrO 2 can perform significantly better than our IrO 2 /GPO electrodes 20,43,44 . This must be related to the relatively low electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of our IrO 2 /GPO composite. When we normalize current densities vs. ECSA (Supplementary Fig. 14), IrO 2 /GPO electrodes reach higher values at lower potentials. Still, the Co 3 O 4 @C catalyst remains competitive as a non-noble-metal catalysts, and especially when current density is normalized per gram (Supplementary Fig. 14), as a more practical parameter for applications.Tafel analyses of the LSV data yielded slopes of 143 mV dec -1 for Co 3 O 4 @C and 82 mV dec -1 for IrO 2 (Fig. 3c), suggesting a different reaction mechanism (rate-limiting step) for these two catalysts, and indicating a faster increment of current density with the applied potential for IrO 2 39,40 .

        <p>As mentioned before, stability is a critical issue for earth-abundant OER catalysts in acidic media [45][46][47][48][49] . To determine the stability of our Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrodes, we take advantage of the benchmarking protocol designed by Jaramillo's group that uses as figure of merit the overpotential required to achieve and maintain a 10 mA cm -2 current density, as this is approximately the current density expected at the anode in a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device under 1 sun illumination 6,50 . The corresponding chronopotentiometry data (Fig. 4a-c) show very good stability for all electrodes, independently of their Co 3 O 4 @C content. In all cases, η j = 10mAcm À2 after 2 h shows just a small increment. In the case of our best electrodes, the 40-Co 3 O 4 @C/ GPO, this increment is of just 3 mV, and the stability is maintained for long times. After 43 h of continuous electrolysis, the overpotential is essentially identical to the starting value (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, even to keep 100 mA cm -2 current density, only 27 mV increment was needed after 2 h catalysis (Supplementary Fig. 11b). We also applied more aggressive stability tests under cycling applied potentials. In this accelerated degradation testing (ADT), complete CV cycles were collected, thus exposing the electrodes sequentially to catalytic and noncatalytic potentials. These conditions simulate better the different degradation mechanisms during electrode and electrolyzer operation. The 40-Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrodes showed also good stability after ~600 CV cycles with only a 14 mV increment in the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm -2 current density (Supplementary Fig. 11c).As mentioned before, stability is a critical issue for earth-abundant OER catalysts in acidic media [45][46][47][48][49] .

        <p>The benchmarking of these electrodes with previous literature is highlighted in the η j = 10mAcm À2 ,t = 2h vs. η j = 10mAcm À2 ,t = 0h plot (Fig. 4d). This comparative plot illustrates the high activity and stability of our electrodes. The three of them appear at the diagonal of the graph, as expected for sustainable performance, and very close and competitive to the results obtained with noble-metal counterparts, indicating that earth-abundant anodes may successfully pass this benchmarking protocol for OER performance in acidic media.The benchmarking of these electrodes with previous literature is highlighted in the η j = 10mAcm À2 ,t = 2h vs. η j = 10mAcm À2 ,t = 0h plot (Fig. 4d).

        <p>Stability number (S-number) and activity-stability factor (ASF) were also proposed as key metrics for estimating lifetime and longterm stability for electrocatalysts [51][52][53] . Thus, we analyzed the electrolyte after stability tests to check for Co leaching (Supplementary Table 3). We found the presence of Co but at the ppb level, corresponding to just ≈0.4 % of the total. Based on this number, we can estimate a 25 S-number, an ASF of 101 and a lifetime of 462 h. These estimations are comparable even to Ir-based catalysts such as SrIrO 3 in analogous conditions, and confirm the promising performance/ stability of these electrodes. It is worthy to mention that this small Co loss does not significantly affect performance. This may be due to Co leaching only from non-catalytically areas, or to the 3D nature of our electrodes. Thus, after leaching, the new surface exposed brings additional active sites, keeping the performance. Both may explain why activity is so stable, but a relatively modest S-number is obtained.Stability number (S-number) and activity-stability factor (ASF) were also proposed as key metrics for estimating lifetime and longterm stability for electrocatalysts [51][52][53] .

        <p>To further confirm the stability of Co 3 O 4 @C as a genuine OER catalyst, we characterized the structural and chemical evolution of the electrodes after these 2 h electrolysis at 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 . The powder XRD patterns did not show any significant change nor shift in the observed peaks, still typical of Co 3 O 4 @C and graphite (Supplementary Fig. 16). This suggests no major structural changes are occurring to the bulk of the material Co 3 O 4 @C.To further confirm the stability of Co 3 O 4 @C as a genuine OER catalyst, we characterized the structural and chemical evolution of the electrodes after these 2 h electrolysis at 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 .

        <p>We explored potential changes on the chemical composition of the catalyst due to OER process by XPS characterization of the fresh electrode and after water electrolysis under different conditions. The Co 2p XPS spectrum of the fresh Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrode (Fig. 5a) shows two peaks located at 794.9 eV (Co 2p 1/2 ) and 779.7 eV (Co 2p 3/2 ), corresponding to the spin-orbit splitting of the 2p orbital. Both components contain equivalent chemical information. The deconvoluted analysis of the peaks reveals the presence of two different chemical components, which we attribute to the Co 3+ (blue) and Co 2+ (green) states, in agreement with the presence of Co 3 O 4 38 . In addition, we observe two doubled satellite peaks arising from charge transfer and final states effects from Co 2+ (satellite A, yellow) and Co 3+ (satellite B, pink) 54 , again characteristic of Co 3 O 4 . We also analyzed the O 1 s peak (Fig. 5a). In addition to the Co-O component (brown) related to the Co 3 O 4 , we observe a higher binding energy component attributed to residual OH/H 2 O (purple). Quantitative analysis of the Co 2p and O 1 s core levels of Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO after chronopotentiometry at 10 mA cm -2 for 2 h (Fig. 5b) and 5 mA cm -2 for 24 h (Fig. 5c) revealed no shifts in the binding energies of the components respect to the fresh sample. Crucially, the main spectral features attributed to a Co 3 O 4 @C catalyst remain unaltered after water electrolysis, which demonstrates the preservation of the oxidation state of the catalyst. Changes in the intensity of the OH/H 2 O component on the O 1s can be fairly attributed to the different environmental conditions of the emersed electrode (see Methods section). XPS analysis of the C component does not evidence significant changes in the oxidation state of the C 1s peak, supporting the preservation of the carbon-based matrix (Supplementary Fig. 17) in agreement to the obtained Faradaic efficiencies. Nitrogen detection in the system is below our resolution limit; therefore, no discussion is referred to this element. Based on the current analysis, the most important finding is that the oxide film is stable and no cobalt oxide is lost nor further oxidized during the electrolysis process. In summary, XRD and XPS strongly support the bulk and surface stability of Co 3 O 4 @C before and after acidic OER electrocatalysis, and its genuine catalytic activity.We explored potential changes on the chemical composition of the catalyst due to OER process by XPS characterization of the fresh electrode and after water electrolysis under different conditions. The Co 2p XPS spectrum of the fresh Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrode (Fig. 5a) shows two peaks located at 794.9 eV (Co 2p 1/2 ) and 779.7 eV (Co 2p 3/2 ), corresponding to the spin-orbit splitting of the 2p orbital. Both components contain equivalent chemical information. The deconvoluted analysis of the peaks reveals the presence of two different chemical components, which we attribute to the Co 3+ (blue) and Co 2+ (green) states, in agreement with the presence of Co 3 O 4 38 . In addition, we observe two doubled satellite peaks arising from charge transfer and final states effects from Co 2+ (satellite A, yellow) and Co 3+ (satellite B, pink) 54 , again characteristic of Co 3 O 4 . We also analyzed the O 1 s peak (Fig. 5a). In addition to the Co-O component (brown) related to the Co 3 O 4 , we observe a higher binding energy component attributed to residual OH/H 2 O (purple).

        <p>To investigate the actual role of the carbon paste in the stability of the electrodes, we carried out additional alternative experiments. First, we directly deposited Co 3 O 4 @C on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode as a Nafion-based ink. This electrode showed a significantly lower electrocatalytic activity when compared with the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO (Figs. 34vs. Supplementary Fig. 18). More importantly, after 30-min of the benchmarking test in 1 M H 2 SO 4 , the Co 3 O 4 @C/GC electrode is apparently deactivated. This suggests that the GPO binder is fundamental to confer the acidic stability and activity of the Co 3 O 4 @C component.To investigate the actual role of the carbon paste in the stability of the electrodes, we carried out additional alternative experiments.

        <p>This effect of the GPO binder could be due to a modified local pH at the electrode/electrolyte interface [55][56][57] . To check this hypothesis, we decided to investigate the effect of the GPO binder on the local pH through the reversible H + /H 2 pair as catalyzed with commercial Pt/C 58 . The reversible potential for this model reaction differs when the Pt/C is directly deposited on a graphite electrode, or when incorporated into a GPO electrode as observed in their CV plots in a hydrogen saturated 1 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 19). An average value of -0.002 V vs. E RHE was estimated for the Pt/C catalyst, in good agreement with the theoretical +0.0 V value. A + 0.031 V vs. E RHE was found for the (Pt/C)/GPO electrode. If we associate this potential difference only to a theoretical local pH difference, ΔE = 0.059 ΔpH, we can estimate a pH difference of just 0.52 unit between both electrodes. Of course, this number cannot be assigned to the actual pH at the surface, since this difference may be caused by pH and other parameters, including Pt surface states. However, such small difference indicates that the higher stability and activity found in GPO electrodes cannot arise exclusively from the modification of the local pH. Therefore, we associate the protective function to the hydrophobic environment, which avoids proper solvation of the oxides, precluding its dissolution. The high hydrophobicity of GPO is corroborated by contact angle tests (Supplementary Fig. 20). A contact angle of 125°was found for a 1 M H 2 SO 4 solution on GPO, significantly higher than on GC (86°).This effect of the GPO binder could be due to a modified local pH at the electrode/electrolyte interface [55][56][57] .

Although it is difficult to estimate the actual active layer, an estimation is suggested that 1/8 of the total electrode pocket volume is used as the maximum limit in contact with the solution in order to determine the mass loading for comparison (Supplementary Table 5) 36 . All potentials were measured vs. Ag/AgCl electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.21 + 0.059 pH (V) while overpotentials η = E RHE -1.229 V.

Single LSV curve was recorded with a 1 mV s -1 scan rate for activity comparison after 10-CV cycle activation in the 0-1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl potential range. Tafel slopes were estimated from the LSV curves by plotting overpotential η vs. log j (j = current density).

For the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) measurements, open circuit potentials (OCPs) vs. the Ag/AgCl were firstly recorded for 30 min to reach rather stable values. Combined with above CV measurements, the 100 mV potential windows centered at OCPs could be determined and cyclic voltammetries were then carried out under scanning rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s -1 . The current density differences between the minimum and maximum values at OCPs vs. the Ag/AgCl and the corresponding scanning rates were plotted to calculate the EDLC value (1/2 of the slope of current density-scan rate plots) 64 .

        <p>Phoibos 100 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (16 mA, 1486.6 V) as the incident photon radiation. XPS spectra of Co 2p, O 1s, N 1s, and C 1s core levels were measured for as received samples deposited on top of indium tape. The spectra are well described by the superposition of several Doniach-Sunjic curve-components. The intensities of the XPS core levels were evaluated by the peak areas, after a standard background subtraction according to Shirley procedure 65 . The spin-orbit splitting for every component into the Co-2p core level has been set to D = 15.2 eV with a branching ratio of 0.5. The metallic cobalt peak, Co 2p 3/2 = 779.7 eV, was used for a final calibration of the spectra 38 . Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO after OER chronopotentiometry at 10 mA cm -2 for 2 h at was washed with acetone in order to remove the paraffin oil prior to XPS measurements. As expected, the treatment do not affect the oxidation state of the composite, as evidenced by the measured spectra.Phoibos 100 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (16 mA, 1486.6 V) as the incident photon radiation.
