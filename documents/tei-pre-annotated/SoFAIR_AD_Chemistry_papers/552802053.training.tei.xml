        <p>Fluorescent probes have emerged as indispensable chemical tools to the field of chemical biology and medicine. The ability to detect intracellular species and monitor physiological processes has not only advanced our knowledge in biology but has provided new approaches towards disease diagnosis. In this review, we detail the design criteria and strategies for some recently reported fluorescent probes that can detect a wide range of biologically important species in cells and in vivo. In doing so, we highlight the importance of each biological species and their role in biological systems and for disease progression. We then discuss the current problems and challenges of existing technologies and provide our perspective on the future directions of the research area. Overall, we hope this review will provide inspiration for researchers and prove as useful guide for the development of the next generation of fluorescent probes.</p>
        <p>Optical imaging technologies are performing essential roles in fundamental research and in clinical medicine. The non-invasive nature and ability to visualize biological processes with high temporal and spatial resolution are one of many reasons for widespread implementation [1]. Motivated to improve the precision, sensitivity and extend the scope of applications of optical imaging, researchers within the chemical community have focused on the development of chemical tools that can detect biological species and monitor key physiological processes. These chemical tools are now commonly referred to as fluorescent probes [2,3]. To date, fluorescent probes have been successfully demonstrated in immunofluorescence staining, live-cell imaging, drug delivery (theranostics) and fluorescence-guided surgery [4][5][6][7][8][9]. However, due to the complexity of biological systems and the limited tissue penetration depth of light, several challenges remain. An ideal fluorescent probe requires high cell/ tissue specificity, high selectivity for the target biomarker whilst in the presence of competing species, photostability, excellent biocompatibility, and longwavelength excitation (a crucial requirement for in vivo imaging). The focus of this review is to detail the various design criteria directed towards fluorescent probes and provide recent literature examples to help the reader gain an in-depth understanding of the area. We hope this review will provide inspiration for researchers to pursue the area of optical imaging and help develop the next generation of fluorescent probes.</p>
        <p>In general, a fluorescent probe incorporates a receptor/reactive site and a fluorophore, as well as a mode of communication between these two sites (Fig. 1a) [10]. This ensures a measurable output is observed upon interaction of the probe with the target analyte. Due to the continued advancements in synthetic methodology and photophysical sciences, the design of fluorescent probes developed for the same biomarker can differ significantly in terms of fluorophore and the recognition unit. This can be seen in the case of the design of fluorescent probes for the detection of peroxynitriteboronate reactive unit [11] and α-ketoamide reactive unit [12]. However, in general, the basic design principles between fluorescent probes remain the same and the observed fluorescence-based responses are either a change in fluorescence emission intensity decrease (fluorescence quenching) or increase (fluorescence enhancement)) or a change in the fluorescence emission wavelength, which can result in ratiometric sensing [13]. Fluorescent probes are commonly found to be divided into two general strategies receptor-based and reaction-based (Fig. 1a). It is important to note, these same design principles apply to the development of photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents; however, the focus for this modality is on a change in absorption [14][15][16]. Receptor-based fluorescent probes are typically employed for the detection of ions such as metal cations and anions through coordination or complexation interactions. Alternatively, reaction-based fluorescent probes are used for the detection of reactive species and enzymes, in which a biomarker interaction results in a chemical reaction that alters the structure of the fluorescent probe and emissive properties [17][18][19][20]. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the applications of receptor-based and reaction-based systems, we have broken this review into sections based on the type of biological species, and provide recent literature examples for the target species.</p>
        <p>The alkali metals are elements in group IA of the periodic table, which include lithium (Li + ), sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), rubidium (Rb + ), cesium (Cs + ) and francium (Fr + ). However, since Na + and K + ions have major biological functions in mammalian cells, we have focused on highlighting fluorescent probes that have been developed for their detection. For the detection of the other alkali metals and an extensive overview on the detection of alkali metal ions, the reader is directed to the following excellent reviews [21][22][23]. All strategies in this section can be considered as receptor-based fluorescent probes.</p>
        <p>Na + and K + ions are important physiological ions for governing osmotic pressure, and play an essential role in gated ion channels by inducing signal transduction in neurons with the formation of travelling membrane potential waves. Some ion channels have been shown to have no absolute selectivity for a single ion; for example, the NaK ion channel transports both K + ions and Na + ions simultaneously into cells [24]. The intracellular K + ion concentration (150 mmol/L) is higher than that of extracellular K + (35 mmol/L), which is used to form an ion gradient for maintaining normal osmotic pressure in cells. Their similar physical properties, coupled relationship and co-existence of Na + ions and K + ions makes it difficult for researchers to selectively detect and differentiate between K + and Na + ions in cellular applications. Over the years, a number of fluorescent probes have been developed for the selective intracellular sensing of K + ions selective over Na + ions [25][26][27][28]. Nucleic acid Gquadruplex- [29] and triazacryptand (TAC)-based probes [30,31] have been developed for the extracellular detection of K + ions. This has been achieved through the limited cell permeability of each probe. Elegantly designed ligand-fluorophore conjugates have been designed for the sensing of intracellular K + ions. The structures of two representative probes (Compound 1 [32] and KS2 [33]) are shown in Fig. 2. A particular noteworthy aspect of the design of these probes is the use of supramolecular host receptors, an azacrown ether (Compound 1) and a cryptand (KS2), which illustrates the importance of having a fluid interface between research areas (i.e., supramolecular chemistry and fluorescent probes). [32] and KS2 [33] for the intracellular detection of K + ions.</p>
        <p>Disruption of K + ion homeostasis is associated with several pathological disorders, which include cardiovascular and neurological disease, diabetes, impairment of renal function, and cancer. Motivated to further our understanding on the role of K + ions during various cellular processes, Wang et al. [34] developed a dual-fluorophore fluorescent probe (RPS-1) that consists of Coumarin 343 as a reference signal and a fluorescent aza-crown ether PS525 that facilitates binding to K + and a ratiometric fluorescent turn on response (Fig. 3a andb). Upon cell internalization, the ester bond of RPS-1 is hydrolyzed releasing Coumarin 343 as the internal reference signal and PS525 to allow the ratiometric detection of K + over Na + ions. The concentration of K + was determined by the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of PS525 (K + -responsive) to that of Coumarin 343 (reference). Notably, RPS-1 was used to monitor the K + ion levels in healthy and cancerous breast cell lines. It was shown that the ratiometric response of RPS-1 in MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer) cells were higher than that in MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial) cells, revealing a potential correlation between K + homeostasis and the progression of breast cancer. Norepinephrine (NE) is a biomarker associated with depression and has been found to be correlated with K + ion concentrations [36,37]. To provide a useful chemical tool that can assess norepinephrine administration, Zhou et al. [35] developed a fluorescent probe (Probe) that exhibited the ability to visualize K + -induced NE signal transduction in neuroendocrine PC12 cells (Fig. 3c). Recent studies have suggested that dead cancer cells release a high concentration of K + ions, which in turn disables T cells around the tumor site and diminishes the overall therapeutic effects of immunotherapy [38]. As such, we anticipate that the development of sensitive K + fluorescent probes capable of sensing cancer-related K + release could facilitate the assessment of cancer immunotherapy, and improve our ability to treat cancers.</p>
        <p>Due to the crucial role of Na + ions in several physiological processes, which include neurotransmitter transport, membrane potential and osmotic homeostatic regulation, extensive effort has been devoted to its sensitive and selective detection. A particular focus has been towards the detection of intracellular Na + ions. However, the extracellular concentration (140 mmol/L) of Na + ions are around 15 times greater than the intracellular concentration (10-15 mmol/L), thereby making the detection of intracellular Na + concentrations challenging. To address these issues, Sarkar et al. [39] developed a twophoton fluorescent probe (ANa2) consisting of a known 1,7-diaza-15-crown-5 Na + ion receptor and a naphthalene-based fluorescent reporter. ANa2 exhibited a 13.4-fold selectivity for Na + (Kd = 22 mmol/L) over K + (Kd = 296 mmol/L) including minimal interferences from other metal ions (Fig. 4), and was used to monitor the decrease in Na + concentration in HeLa cells after treatment by the agonist, histamine. Tang and co-workers [40] developed a nearinfrared fluorescent probe, cBDP that displayed similar binding strengths for Na + and K + ions (Kd = 18.62 mmol/L for Na + and 19.50 mmol/L for K + ). cBDP was used for the quantification of Na + and K + ions by microchip electrophoresis at the single-cell level. This research provided a new approach for the detection of Na + and K + ions by combining fluorescent probes with other analytical technologies. [39] and cBDP [40] for the detection of Na + ions.</p>
        <p>The elements in group IIA of the periodic table are referred to as alkali earth metals, which include beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ions are the most biologically important alkali earth metal ions and as such we have focused on fluorescent probes developed for their detection. For an extensive overview on the detection of alkali earth metals, the reader is directed to the following recent reviews [41][42][43]. All strategies in this section can be considered as receptorbased fluorescent probes. Ca 2+ ions are essential for metabolism, bone growth, muscle/nerve activity, and acid-base balance. Meanwhile, Ca 2+ ions have also been implicated in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Due to these reasons, extensive efforts have been directed towards the development of fluorescent probes that can selectively detect Ca 2+ ions in biological systems.</p>
        <p>Several systems are based on Ca 2+ -chelation motifs such as carboxylic acids (EGTA-3a) and crown ethers (calix [4]-crown-4 3a and Compound 3) (Fig. 5) [44]. Notably, several Ca 2+ probes have already been commercialized; these include Fluo-3 (cat. no. 46393-1MG-F, Sigma-Aldrich)/4 (cat. no. F14201, ThermoFisher)/8 (cat. no. F141112-1mg, Aladdin), Rhod-2 (cat. no. R1245MP, ThermoFisher)/4 (cat. no. 21120, AAT Bioquest), Fura-2 (cat. no. 21020, AAT Bioquest), Indo-1 (cat. no. 21030, AAT Bioquest), and Calbryte-520/590/630 (cat. no. 20650/20700/20720, AAT Bioquest). The commercialization of Ca 2+ probes highlights the importance of the biological evaluation of Ca 2+ ions. Despite these advancements, there are a number of drawbacks with current systems, these include poor intracellular localization, short cellular retention times, and potential cytotoxicity [45,46]. These factors make it difficult to accurately image Ca 2+ ions in subcellular organelles.</p>
        <p>Alternative approaches to Ca 2+ -based fluorescent probes include biomacromolecular probes with genetically-encoded indicators [47][48][49] and DNA sensors [50]. [51], calix [4]-crown-4 3a [52] and Compound 3 [53] for the detection of Ca 2+ ions.</p>
        <p>Recently, Pendin et al. [54] have developed a fluorescent probe, mt-fura-2-AM, that was able to detect Ca 2+ in the mitochondria of HeLa cells (Fig. 6). In comparison with the commercial Ca 2+ fluorescent probe Rhod-2, mt-fura-2-AM exhibited enhanced photostability and a lower mitochondrial leakage rate. Illustrating its suitably for biological studies, mtfura-2-AM was used for the real-time visualization of Ca 2+ ion flow in HeLa cells, and was used to observe changes in Ca 2+ concentrations in cardiomyocytes and astrocytes when stimulated with potassium chloride and ATP, respectively. To achieve the imaging of Ca 2+ in deep-tissues, Shemetov et al. [55] reported a rare example of a near-infrared (NIR) Ca 2+ sensor (λex, = 640 nm, λem, = 720 nm), which used a genetically encoded indicator iGECI rather than a traditional fluorescent probe. To date, only a limited number of NIR fluorescent probes have been reported, such as CaSiR-1 (λex, = 650 nm, λem, = 654 nm) and Ca-NIR (λex, = 616 nm, λem, = 684 nm) [56]. This illustrates the urgent need to develop additional NIR Ca 2+responsive fluorescent probes to facilitate the evaluation of Ca 2+ ions in vivo. 7). Specifically, Mag-S-Tz exhibited a 24-fold fluorescence enhancement at 595 nm after a bioorthogonal click reaction between tetrazine and a cyclooctyne halotag. Significantly, a blue shift in fluorescence to 565 nm was seen upon binding with Mg 2+ ions. This strategy provided a sensitive means for the in-situ activation with genetically fused proteins to facilitate more precise imaging of Mg 2+ ions in organelles.</p>
        <p>This strategy was used to determine that the concentration of Mg 2+ ions in the cell nucleus was lower than that in the Golgi apparatus or cytosol [58]. with permission from Ref. [57], Copyright © 2016 American Chemical Society.</p>
        <p>Within transition metals, iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are the most essential to biological systems. We therefore focus on the development of fluorescent probes that have been designed for their detection. For an extensive overview on fluorescent probes developed for the detection of transition-metal ions, the reader is directed to other relevant reports [42,[59][60][61][62][63][64]. Due to the unique properties of transition metals, the strategies shown in this section are either receptor-based or reaction-based fluorescent probes.</p>
        <p>Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ions are essential for a myriad of redox catalytic physiological processes such as aerobic respiration and DNA replication [65,66]. Due to the presence of high intracellular concentrations of glutathione (GSH), and iron-related transporters, Fe in cells tends to exist in 2+ oxidation state (Fe 2+ ). However, Fe 2+ ions are known to catalyze the Fenton reaction and produce highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals, which can deactivate biological proteins and induce cellular apoptosis [67]. Therefore, abnormal Fe 2+/3+ uptake and storage has been associated with certain cancers [62] [68], L′ (isomer Z) [69], REPN [70] and BOD-NHOH [71] for sensing Fe 3+ ions. [72], IP1 [73], ICL-1 [74] and RhoNox-1 [75] for sensing Fe 2+ ions.</p>
        <p>As can be seen in Figs. 8 and9, fluorescent probes that have been developed for the detection of Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ either using a receptor motif or a Fe-reactive site. Initial Fe-based detection strategies exploited known metal-ligand interactions. Unfortunately, this approach was found unsuitable for imaging biological systems due to paramagnetic fluorescence quenching and issues with selectivity. This is a common problem for receptor-based fluorescent probes used for the detection of transition metals. This problem attracted significant attention from the imaging community aiming to develop strategies able to overcome this fluorescence quenching limitation. A notable example was developed in 2013 by Hirayama et al. [75]. RhoNox-1 consisting of the rhodamine B fluorophore masked with an N-oxide unit. The fluorescence of RhoNox-1 was initially quenched by an N-oxide functionality. Then the addition of Fe 2+ ions to RhoNox-1 resulted in a sequential reduction of the N-oxide unit, which afforded the highly fluorescent rhodamine B fluorophore. This fluorescent probe strategy was used to monitor Fe 2+ perturbations in in HepG2 cells by exogenous stimulation (ferrous ammonium sulfate or 2,2′-bipyridyl) [75]. Subsequent efforts from the same group were made to improve the sensing performances of their developed Fe 2+ probe. The newly developed fluorescent probe Mem-RhoNox consisted of the Fe 2+ was shown to reduce to Fe 2+ on the cell membrane prior to being transported to the lysosome for iron storage [76,77], and that Fe 2+ is essential for the synthesis of heme protein in the mitochondria [78].</p>
        <p>Another noteworthy example was reported by Spangler et al., which exploited the redox activity of Fe 2+ ions for peroxides. The reported Fe 2+ Probe 3 contained a fluorophorequencher pair connected via a 1,2,4-trioxolane linker. A strong fluorescence was observed upon the reaction between Fe 2+ ions and 1,2,4-trioxolane unit since the fluorophore and quencher were now separated (shown via HPLC analysis). This strategy was further extended to the Fe-mediated release of small molecules, which was demonstrated using antibiotic puromycin (PURO) (Fig. 10a) [79]. Extending the scope of this strategy, Aron et al. [80] utilized the 1,2,4-trioxolane linker to develop the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) [2] fluorescent probe, FIP-1, for the ratiometric detection of Fe 2+ ions. This was achieved through conjugating the fluorophores fluorescein and cyanine-3 (Cy3) via the 1,2,4trioxolane linker (Fig. 10b). In the presence of Fe 2+ , the ring-opening of trioxolane facilitated the release of each fluorophore and inhibition of the FRET process. This enabled the ratiometric sensing of labile Fe 2+ pools during ferroptosis. In a subsequent study, the same group reported the bioluminescent Fe 2+ probe ICL-1, which consisted of D-aminofluorescein that was caged with the 1,2,4-trioxolane unit. The Fe 2+ -mediated cleavage of the peroxide bridge released D-amino luciferin and enabled its oxidation by luciferase to produce oxyaminoluciferin and bioluminescence-based emission. The minimal background interference seen with bioluminescence enabled this probe to be successfully used for the imaging of unstable iron pools in a mouse model infected by Acinetobacter baumannii (Fig. 10c) [74]. Copper ions (Cu 2+ /Cu + ) are essential for cellular respiration and metabolic activities [81][82][83]. Abnormal Cu concentrations have been associated with a number of serious diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [84], Parkinson's disease [85,86] and cancer [81,87,88].</p>
        <p>Therefore, the development of chemical tools that enable the accurate detection of Cu ions in cells are desired for improving our fundamental understanding to its role in various pathophysiological processes, such as FluTPA2, CSCN-Cu, 3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin, Compounds 8 and 2 (Fig. 11). probes FluTPA2 [89], CSCN-Cu [90], 3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin [91], Compounds 8 [92] and 2 [93] for sensing Cu 2+ /Cu + ions.</p>
        <p>Cu + is the predominant oxidation state (rather than Cu 2+ ) found in cells due to the reducing cellular environment. Significant focus has therefore been directed towards the development of fluorescent probes that can detect Cu + ions in biological systems. It is important to note that fluorescent probes for the detection of Cu 2+ ions have also been reported. The reader is directed to the following reviews [94,95]. Chang and co-workers [88] developed the FRET probe, FCP-1, that incorporated their previously reported tris[(2pyridyl)methyl]amine (TPA) Cu + -triggered C-O cleavage reactive unit (Fig. 12a).</p>
        <p>were linked to each other using TPA, which served as both linker and chelating motif.</p>
        <p>Initially, FCP-1 was orange emissive (576 nm) with an excitation of 458 nm. This was due to the FRET from Fluo-Me to RB. In the presence of Cu + , FCP-1 underwent the Cu + -triggered C-O oxidative cleavage, leading to loss of the FRET process and observation of the Fluo-Me fluorescence emission (526 nm). FCP-1 was used to monitor changes in concentration of Cu + ions in HEK293T cells (human embryonic kidney) and Cu + ions changes induced by GSH in response to oncogene expression (BRAF V600E or KRAS G12D ). This study illustrated the use of FCP-1 as a powerful chemical tool for investigating the intrinsic relationship between Cu + ions and redox signaling pathways. Most fluorescent probes that have been developed for the detection of Cu + ions rely on TPA-based Cu + -triggered bond cleavage. However, the resultant unmasked fluorophores are prone to diffusion, which makes it difficult to determine the precise location of Cu + ions in cells. To overcome this problem, Lee et al. [96] reported the fluorescent probe CD649, which exploits the protein-based conjugation of thioether-based acylimidazoles (Fig. 12b). The unique advantage of CD649 was the ability of the acylimidazole group to be used for the affinity-labeling of proteins [97]. The chelation of Cu + ions to the thioether acylimidazole resulted in an enhanced electrophilicity allowing the covalent labelling of proximal proteins (copper transporter protein ATP7A) through nucleophilic addition. Compared to traditional TPA-based fluorescent probes, this new strategy improved the imaging resolution, as well as facilitating long-time monitoring of proteins adjacent to intracellular Cu + ions the result of proximal labelling. CD649 was used to analyze the redistribution of variable copper pools in three types of cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) from the brain after depolarization stimulation. CD649 facilitated the evaluation of the distinct functional roles played by Cu + ions in different brain cell types.</p>
        <p>Zn 2+ is the second most abundant transition-metal ion in the body and is used in nucleic acid and protein synthesis, immune response, and gene transcription. Abnormal concentrations of Zn 2+ ions have been associated with immunologic diseases and the impairment of the nervous system, and prostate cancer [98]. Therefore, it is essential to develop chemical tools that can monitor Zn 2+ levels in cells and in real-time. Owing to the known dynamic fluctuations of Zn 2+ ions the accurate interpretation of the functional role of Zn 2+ ions during various pathological processes is difficult. To date, a variety of Zn 2+ fluorescent probes have been developed, such as SZn-Mito, HPO, BAR and H2L [99][100][101] (Fig. 13), however, many suffer from photobleaching and poor sensitivity. [102], HPO [103], BAR [104], H2L [105] developed for the detection of Zn 2+ ions.</p>
        <p>Xu et al. [106] reported the FRET-based probe, CPBT, for the detection of Zn 2+ ions in the endoplasmic reticulum. CPBT was synthesized by coupling a coumarin FRET donor to the benzofurazan FRET acceptor functionalized with the Zn 2+ ion receptor, N-2methylpyridinyl (Fig. 14a). The chelation of Zn 2+ ions resulted in the inhibition of the FRET process between coumarin and benzofurazan and a ratiometric change in fluorescence emission from 560 to 480 nm. CPBT was used to detect Zn 2+ ions in the heads of zebrafish larvae. In combination with flow cytometry, CPBT was used to monitor changes in Zn 2+ ions in cells, including MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line), A549 (human lung carcinoma cell), SGC-7901 (gastric cancer cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian cancer cell). A subsequent imaging assay revealed that MCF-7 and SKOV3 cells exhibited an opposite trend in Zn 2+ concentration changes after treatment with the anti-cancer drug, cisplatin, providing new insight into the relationship between cell apoptosis and Zn 2+ metabolism. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) is known to hydrolyze the majority of β-lactam antibiotics [108]. Clinical variants of NDM show an increased affinity towards Zn 2+ , which is considered key to antibiotic resistance. Despite this knowledge, a lack of effective methods to evaluate dynamic changes in the Zn 2+ state of NDM exists. Inspired by a previously reported thiol inhibitor of NDM, Mehta et al. [107] designed a reversible binding fluorescent probe 4D that can detect the bis-zinc form in the structure of NDM-1 (a clinical variant of NDM) (Fig. 14b), facilitating the dynamic monitoring of NDM metallization in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and provide a novel approach to explore the functional role of Zn 2+ with NDM. Fluorescent probes for ions discussed in this review are highlighted in Table 1. a) BODIPY, boron dipyrromethene; TCF, 2-dicyanomethylene-3-cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran; Cy7, cyanine 7; TPP, triphenylphosphonium; Fluo, fluorescein. "-" means no excitation is applied.</p>
        <p>In addition to the crucial role of metal cations, several biological anions are known to have important roles in many physiological pathological processes. These biological anions include sulfite (SO3 2-)/bisulfite (HSO3 -), halogens (F -, Cl -, Br -and I -), phosphate (HPO4 2-) /pyrophosphate (P2O7 4-), nitrate (NO3 -)/nitrite (NO2 -) and selenate (SeO4 2-)/selenite (SeO3 2-).</p>
        <p>This section will summarize representative examples of fluorescent probes that facilitate the functional imaging of these anions. For a more extensive coverage of the detection of biological important anions, the reader is directed to the following reviews [109][110][111].</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a common gaseous molecule found in biological systems that can be converted to sulfite (SO3 2-) and bisulfite (HSO3 -) via hydrolysis and ionization. Sulfites and bisulfites are known to act as blood vessel dilators. However, excessive sulfites are known to contribute to diseases such as pneumonia and neurological disorders [112]. For these reasons, several reaction-based fluorescent probes have been developed for the detection of sulfites.</p>
        <p>These strategies are based on the SO3 2-and HSO3 --mediated deprotection of levulinate ester [113], nucleophilic addition to aldehydes [114][115][116] and double bonds (C=C [117][118][119] or N=N [120,121] (Fig. 15). with permission from Ref.

        <p>In contrast to previously reported fluorescent probes, Zhang et al. [122] reported a remote light-controlled photochromic probe, SP-Gal for the detection of SO3 2-/HSO3 -. SP-Gal consisted of a spiropyran/merocyanine (SP/MR) photochromic unit, a naphthalimide (Naph) fluorescence reporter, and a galactose targeting unit, specific for asialoglycoprotein receptors overexpressed on the surface of hepatocyte carcinoma cells, (HepG2) (Fig. 16). SP-Gal formed micelles and was used for the selective visualization of SO3 2-concentrations in HepG2 cell lines. In cells, the SP and MR state of the probe could be reversibly transformed under alternating UV and visible light irradiation. This transformation resulted in fluorescence "blinking" of the naphthalimide emission due to an alternating activated FRET</p>
        <p>In biological systems, the extracellular chloride (Cl -) ion concentration (120 mmol/L) is usually higher than that of the intracellular concentration (5-40 mmol/L), thus ion transporters are used to govern the concentration gradient of intracellular and extracellular Cl -. Abnormal concentrations of Cl -ions can disrupt intracellular pH and cellular autophagy, thereby inducing apoptosis. Defects in ion channels can result in deterioration of the physiological functions of cells and cause serious diseases such as osteoporosis, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's disease [123,124]. A diverse range of ion transporter molecules have been developed in order to alleviate symptoms of diseases caused by ion channel defects [125]. Interestingly, chloride ionophores have been shown to induce cell apoptosis by activating the caspase pathway in cancer cells, which is expected to become a new cancer therapeutic approach [126]. To date, many synthetic Cl -fluorescent molecules have been reported, such as MQAE, S1, Lucigenin and R3 (Fig. 17). However, there are still a lack of reported fluorescent probes that can selectively detect Cl -ions in subcellular organelles.</p>

        <p>Lucigenin [129] and R3 [130] for sensing Cl -ions.</p>
        <p>Recent efforts by Park et al. [131] led to the development of a lysosome-targeting fluorescent probe MQAE-MP for visualizing changes in lysosomal Cl -concentrations (Fig. 18). MQAE-MP proved useful for imaging the spatial and temporal distribution of Cl -by fluorescence microscopy in the lysosomes of HeLa cells. In this study, they found that the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes was suppressed when lysosomal Cl -concentration is stable but concentrations of cytosolic Ca 2+ decrease. In contrast, when the cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration remains constant but concentrations of Cl -decrease, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes was activated. Extensive research has also focused on the development of fluorescent probes able to detect other halogen anions, including fluoride (F -) [132,133], bromide (Br -) [134,135] and iodide (I -) [136,137]. Feng et al. [138] reported a NIR probe, DCM-Si, which exploits fluoride-mediated silyl deprotection of oxygen functionalities (Fig. 19). The probe was used to image F -in zebrafish. Qu et al. (Fig. 20). However, in contrast to PPi, there are relatively fewer fluorescent probes available for the detection of other complicated phosphates (i.e., AMP, ADP and ATP) [142].</p>

        <p>The post-translational modification of proteins is an essential process that affords proteins with a diverse range of functions. Unfortunately, the analysis of proteins modified with PPi remains challenging. Traditional biochemical methods require cell lysis, which is not applicable for the real time imaging of phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways in cells. To detect and enrich pyrophosphorylated peptides in cell lysates, Conway et al. [147] developed a bis-Zn 2+ -ligand 8 complex and anchored it to a solid-phase resin (Fig. 21) for enrichment of pyrophosphoproteins based on the selective chelation between Zn 2+ and PPi.</p>
        <p>The enrichment capacity of pyrophosphoproteins was further validated by quantifying the fluorescent intensity of pyrophosphoproteins bearing a dansyl fluorophore in complex cell lysates. In the presence of 100 equivalents of other interfering phosphorylated peptides, the system was unaffected and performed well for the sensitive enrichment of the phosphopeptides of interest. As such, this study provided an approach for characterizing the dynamics of protein pyrophosphorylation. Fluorescent probes for anions discussed in this review are highlighted in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Selenate (SeO 2- 4 ) and selenite (SeO 2- 3 ) are involved in many vital processes in the human body, such as cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, and immunologic response. To date, extensive efforts have been made to detect selenate and selenite in vitro [148][149][150], but few studies have achieved in vivo sensing of these species. Tian et al. [151] reported an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) [3]-based fluorescent probe, HBTN-Se, for the ratiometric detection of sodium selenite in HepG2 (cancer) and L-02 (normal) cells using a SeO3 2--mediated hydroxyl-deprotection mechanism (Fig. 22b). HBTN-Se enabled the differentiation of selenite concentrations between normal (L02) and HepG2 cells, as well as assessing the relationship between the concentration and physiological effects of sodium selenite in cells. Kong et al. [152] developed the fluorescent probe, HB consisting of a hemicyanine conjugated with a 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (BS) (Fig. 22c). HB was used for the detection of selenocysteine (Sec) in HepG2 and HL-7702 (human normal liver) cells.</p>
        <p>Upon exposure to Na2SeO3, its antitumor effect in HepG2 cells was derived from inducing the formation of Sec. Trace selenium has been found to be useful in cancer therapy, but the mechanism of action remains unclear. Therefore, more accurate and sensitive fluorescent probes are required to enable the elaboration of the biological functions of SeO4 2-and SeO3 2- ions.</p>
        <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of oxygen metabolism, which is essential to maintain the balance of oxidative stress in living organisms. However, abnormal levels of ROS can cause various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The main forms of ROS that exist in humans include singlet oxygen ( 1 O2), hydroxyl radical ( • OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2 •-). However, the sensitive detection of these ROS is restricted by their short half-life and low concentration in living cells. The reader is directed to a number of reviews that provide an extensive overview on fluorescent probes developed for the detection of ROS [153][154][155].</p>
        <p>Enormous efforts have been made towards the development of fluorescent probes for the detection of ROS [3], here we summarize some recent advances based on different reaction mechanisms, such as ESIPT, FRET and chemiluminescence. Wu et al. [156] developed the ESIPT fluorescent probe, TCBT-OMe, for the ratiometric detection of hypochlorous acid (HClO/ClO -) in live cells (Fig. 23a). TCBT-OMe displayed a low limit of detection (0.16 nM) and exhibited excellent selectivity for HClO/ClO -over other ROS/RNS species. Chang and co-workers reported the FRET fluorescent probe RPF1 [157] for the ratiometric detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). RPF1 consisted of a bis-boronate-masked fluorescein (FRET acceptor) that was conjugated to a coumarin (FRET donor). The presence of H2O2 resulted in the oxidative-mediated deprotection of the boronates and afforded a highly fluorescent fluorescein derivative. This reaction event activated FRET between the coumarin (donor) to fluorescein (acceptor) fluorophores (Fig. 23b) enabling the ratiometric detection of H2O2. To overcome diffusion issues with activated fluorophores, Iwashita et al. [158] developed the fluorescent probe, PG1-FM, a boronate-protected rhodamine functionalized with a benzyl fluoride arm for the sensitive and selective detection of H2O2 and covalent attachment with proteins (Fig. 23c). In the presence of H2O2, the oxidation reaction afforded a fluorescent rhodamine product. Protein staining in the vicinity of H2O2 was shown to be fixed and H2O2 could be monitored using fluorescence microscopy. The visualization of the transcellular ROS signals in a microglia-neuron co-culture system provided evidence for ROS instigated neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic strokes, and brain injuries.</p>
        <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a cellular messenger that plays an important role in several cardiovascular, nervous, and immune processes, as well as in lysosomal autophagy [166].</p>
        <p>The importance of nitric oxide has attractive significant attention from the imaging community aiming to develop fluorescent probes that enables its detection in vitro and in vivo. ONOO -is a highly reactive ROS/RNS that plays a role in signal transmission, apoptosis, necrosis, and tumorigenesis. The currently reported fluorescent probes for ONOO -are mainly based on ONOO --triggered deprotection reactions, which results in limitations of specificity. Through a screening of previously reported structures, Cheng et al. [170] developed a FRET probe MITO-CC consisting of benzopyrylium and coumarin for the sensitive and selective detection of endogenous ONOO -in HepG2 cells. The proposed mechanism of action was the nucleophilic addition of ONOO -to the chromenylium fluorophore followed by subsequent oxidation, elimination, and hydrolysis reactions to afford an olefine acid by-product that exhibited 473 nm emission (Fig. 25c). Cao et al. [171] developed the chemiluminescent probe, PNCL for the detection of endogenous ONOO - using a unique oxidative decarbonylation reaction between isatin and ONOO -in RAW 264.7 macrophages. To confirm the ONOO-mediated response, the chemiluminescence response was found to decrease after treatment with nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, 1400 W (N-[[3-(aminomethyl)phenyl]methyl]-ethanimidamide dihydrochloride). The result suggested that the production of ONOO -is dependent on iNOS (Fig. 25d).</p>
        <p>Sedgwick et al. [11] with FA, producing a red fluorescence at 633 nm. This enabled the measurement of exogenous FA in HEK293TN and Neuroscreen-1 (rat neuronal cell line) cells, providing a potential approach to elucidate the pivotal role of FA in living cells (Fig. 27a).</p>
        <p>Bruemmer et al. [173] developed the FA-responsive chemiluminescent probe, CFAP700</p>
        <p>for the NIR chemiluminescence imaging of FA in HEK293 cells and FVB-luc + mice.</p>
        <p>CFAP700 was able to image concentration changes of FA in FVB-luc + mice treated with tetrahydrofolate/folinate (FA inducer) and NaHSO3 (FA scavenger) (Fig. 27b).</p>

        <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a signaling molecule involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. These include signal transduction, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases. Palladium-mediated carbonylation of CO is a common method for the construction of CO probes. However, many currently available probes exhibit poor water solubility and display high cytotoxicity, which makes them unsuitable for the in vivo imaging of CO. Morstein et al. [174] replaced the commonly used palladium ligands (thiomethoxide, hydroxylamine and pyridine) with a morpholine ligand (Fig. 27c), resulting in an enhanced water solubility and reduced cytotoxicity while retaining CO reactivity. COP-3-Py enabled the monitoring of exogenous CO in HEK293T cells through the treatment of [Ru(CO)3Cl-(glycinate)] (CORM-3), and the visualization in electrically stimulated and N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA)-stimulated dopamine release in drosophila brain. Robson et al. [175] reported on fluorescent Probe 6, consisting of a divalent ruthenium vinyl complex, which enabled CO imaging (Fig. 27d). Probe 6 was used to detect CO and monitor viscosity changes in MCF-7 cells using fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM), enabling the evaluation of the correlation between CO signaling and changes in viscosity.</p>
        <p>As a vital plant hormone, ethylene is involved in a complex set of signaling pathways such as cell division, growth, and pathogen response. Although several fluorescent probes for ethylene have been developed, detection of ethylene in living cells remains challenging.</p>
        <p>Toussaint et al. [176] reported the ethylene responsive probe BEP-4 for the detection of ethylene in live cells. The Ru complex served as the reactive site for ethylene and borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) was used as the fluorescent reporter (Fig. 28). BEP-4 could be used for the detection of ethylene in HEK239T cells exposed to ethylene gas.</p>
        <p>Biothiols, cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH) play crucial roles for redox homeostasis, biocatalysis and protein modification. Unfortunately, these three reactive biothiols are often difficult to differentiate due to their structural similarities. In recent years, significant efforts have been made towards the development of selective RSS probes. For an extensive overview of RSS probes, the reader is directed to the following recent reviews [154,167,177,178].</p>
        <p>A common employed strategy used to differentiate structurally similar biothiols uses intramolecular cyclization/addition reactions. Yang et al. [179] developed the benzothiazole derivative (Probe 4) for the discrimination between Cys and Hcy. This strategy exploits the difference in kinetics of ring formation between Cys/Hcy and an acrylate unit. Upon ring formation, the 2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HMBT) fluorophore is released and affords a change in fluorescence emission (Fig. 29a). As discussed in brief previously, H2S is an important signaling molecule that has a role in vasodilation, oxidative stress, and cancer development. Recently, Cao et al. [180] developed a chemiluminescent probe CHS-3 for the in vivo imaging of H2S (Fig. 29b). The chemiluminescent strategy alleviated problems often associated with fluorescent probes such as background interference and photostability.</p>
        <p>Phosphatases are important enzymes known to modulate the dephosphorylation of biomacromolecules. The activity of this enzyme is believed to be controlled by signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, Ou et al. [181] was motivated to develop the fluorescent probe N3-CR-PO4 that can simultaneously detect H2S levels (by reduction of the azide functionality) at 445 nm and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (by removal of the phosphate ester on fluorescein) at 545 nm in HeLa cells. In the presence of both H2S and ALP, FRET between coumarin and fluorescein was enabled (Fig. 29c). Notably, N3-CR-PO4 can be used to image H2S or ALP in HeLa cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, H2S scavenger) and Na3VO4</p>
        <p>(ALP inhibitor), respectively, indicating the importance of H2S for the regulation of enzyme activity.</p>

        <p>Nitroso acid (HSNO) is the smallest S-nitrosothiol and is key to deciphering the relationship between H2S and NO. Its biological function remains unclear due to a lack of effective fluorescent probes. Chen et al. [182] synthesized the fluorescent probe, TAP-1, for HSNO detection with 2-mercaptobenzoate as the HSNO reaction site (Fig. 29d). Initially, the fluorescence emission was quenched by PeT and intramolecular spirocyclization effects.</p>
        <p>Exposure to HSNO resulted in the deprotection of 2-mercaptobenzoate and subsequent increase in fluorescence emission, which enabled the detection of endogenous HSNO in HeLa cells. This research outlined an important approach on how to evaluate the intrinsic relationship between H2S and NO.</p>
        <p>The process of apoptosis eliminates abnormal cells so that normal physiological processes can be maintained. Abnormal apoptotic processes can lead to autoimmune diseases and cancer. In cancer cells, high concentrations of GSH reduce oxidative stress and diminish the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, GSH depletion could be an effective approach for cancer therapy. Talukdar and co-workers [183] found that the T-DNS probe This was accompanied with an increase in blue fluorescence emission at 410 nm (Fig. 30).</p>
        <p>This research suggests that instigation of artificial ion channel transport in cancer cells when activated by endogenous biospecies could represent a promising approach for cancer therapy.</p>

        <p>Enzymes play a central role in living systems, mainly by acting as specific catalysts for a myriad of biochemical reactions. Each enzyme has a certain role to play in maintaining the balance of a living system. However, abnormal enzymatic activity has been associated with several serious diseases. The development of small-molecule fluorescent probes that can noninvasively visualize enzymatic activity in real-time are therefore urgently needed to help improve our understanding on their biological and pathological roles [184]. In this section, we will discuss the recent progress towards small-molecule fluorescent probes for the functional imaging of enzymatic activities in living systems.</p>
        <p>Glycosylation is the process by which glycans are covalently attached to biomolecules (e.g., proteins and lipids) by glycotransferases [185], while, deglycosylation is the removal of saccharides from biomolecules in the presence of glycosidases. Protein glycosylation has been associated with the progression of several diseases, which include cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, lung diseases, blood disorders and genetic disorders. The glycosylation and de-glycosylation of biomacromolecules are regulated by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, respectively [186][187][188][189]. Therefore, chemical tools that can interrogate these processes are useful for drug development and fundamental research.</p>
        <p>For an extensive overview, the reader is directed to several elegant papers [190,191].</p>
        <p>β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) is a well-known glycosidase that selectively removes galactose units found on glycoconjugates [192]. These galactose-based glycoconjugates are known to be overexpressed during cell senescence and in ovarian cancer. During fluorescent probe development, it is important to have the ability to distinguish between cell senescenceassociated β-Gal (SA-β-Gal) and other β-Gals expressions. Gao et al. [193] reported two fluorescent probes, KSA01 and KSA02, that produced sequential fluorescent responses to β-Gal and alkaline pH. This was achieved through the removal of the β-Gal unit followed by an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect mediated by an alkaline environment (Fig. 31). KSA01 and KSA02 were used to track cell senescence with high precision through the simultaneous analysis of SA-β-Gal activity and its local acidic microenvironment. This ability enabled the remarkable differentiation between senescent cells and ovarian cancer cells. Hydrolysis of KSA01 and KSA02 by β-Gal produced the fluorescent products KSAP1</p>
        <p>and KSAP2, respectively. The fluorescent products displayed a green fluorescence at 534 nm and an orange-red fluorescence at 562 nm under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively.</p>
        <p>Through their study, each probe was able to simultaneous track changes in β-Gal expression and pH in senescent human lung fibroblastic cells (MRC-5) and in senescent HL-7702 (human liver) cells treated by doxorubicin (DOX). The red and green fluorescence of KSA02 was found to dominate in DOX-induced senescent HL-7702 and SKOV3 cells, respectively, which was ascribed to differential lysosomal pH of the two cell lines. By treating kidney tissue of DOX-induced aged C57BL/6J male mice with these two probes, respectively, the total fluorescence intensity (I562 + I534) as well as the fluorescence intensity ratio (I562/I534) of each probe increased, suggesting that the SA-β-gal level and acidity in kidney tissue increased with age. Researchers have pointed out that SA-β-Gal alone is not sufficient as a biomarker of cell senescence [194]. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels and enzymatic activity of the FUCA1-encoded α-L-fucosidase (α-fuc) were also found to upregulated in multiple models of senescence, including oncogenic, drug-induced and replicative cellular senescence [195].</p>
        <p>Therefore, to improve the precision by which senescence is detected, Kim and co-workers [196]</p>
        <p>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a hydrolytic enzyme that is responsible for the dephosphorylation of nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids. ALP is widely distributed in human liver, bone, intestine, kidney and placenta, and is used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of liver dysfunction, leukocytosis, biliary obstruction, Alzheimer's disease, liver cancer and prostate cancer [64,197]. Therefore, a vast number of fluorescent probes have been developed for the detection of ALP and as such the reader is directed to a number of literature examples and reviews [198][199][200].</p>
        <p>Li et al. [201] developed the AIE-based fluorescent probe, DQM-ALP (Fig. 33), for monitoring ALP activity and for distinguishing between tumor tissue and healthy tissue.</p>
        <p>DQM-ALP was constructed using an AIEgen-quinoline-malononitrile (QM) as the fluorophore, and a water-soluble phosphate group as the ALP-recognition site [202].</p>
        <p>Depression is a psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. Abnormalities in the metabolism of neurotransmitters in the brain are a major cause of oxidative stress that occurs during depression. Abnormal expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key hydrolase in the cholinergic system, causes alterations in acetylcholine levels and affects neural signalling. Therefore, effective monitoring of changes in the activity of AChE facilitates mechanistic investigations of oxidative stress during depression [203]. Wang et al.</p>
        <p>[204] developed a small-molecule fluorescent probe (MCYN) for the detection of AChE (Fig. 34). MCYN consists of the merocyanine fluorophore and is blocked with a dimethyl carbamate, an AChE-responsive moiety. Initially, MCYN was non-fluorescent due to a weak push-pull electronic effect. However, after hydrolysis by AChE, a strong fluorescence signal was observed caused by the enhanced push-pull electronic effect. MCYN exhibited a high sensitivity towards AChE with a limit of detection of 0.36 U/mL, and a working pH range of</p>
        <p>Aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as CD13) is a Zn 2+ -dependent membrane-bound exopeptidase that catalyses the cleavage of amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein or from a peptide substrate. APN is implicated in different stages (e.g., cell proliferation, secretion, invasion and angiogenesis) of cancer development, and has been regarded as a target for tumor diagnosis and treatment [207]. Li et al. [208] reported the fluorescent probe, YH-APN, for the monitoring and imaging of APN activity in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 36). YH-APN consisted of a dicyanoisophorone fluorophore and an L-alanine APN recognition site.</p>
        <p>Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid (AA) [210]. COX contains two main isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2, of which COX-1 is found mainly in vascular, gastric and renal tissues, and is involved in the regulation of vasodilation, platelet aggregation, gastric mucus secretion and renal function. tumor-bearing mice and human glioma tissue using two-photon microscopy, achieving the differentiation of cancerous tissue from paraneoplastic tissue. Fluorescent probes for enzymes discussed in this review are highlighted in Table 4. Activatable small-molecule fluorescent probes can also be used to detect other biomolecules, such as DNA G-quadruplex [214], double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) [215],</p>
        <p>RNA [216]. For recent comprehensive reviews on this subject, please refer to the following papers [217][218][219][220].</p>
        <p>The occurrence and progression of human diseases are marked by changes in the expression level and dynamic translocation of specific biological species including ions, reactive species, and enzymes at the cellular level. To image these dynamic changes in live cells and in vivo provides a basis for the better understanding of fundamental biology and research on disease development and progression. Small-molecule fluorescent probes have been developed, as summarized in this review, that allow the qualitative and quantitative detection of these biological important analytes. As can be seen throughout the review fluorescent probes have exhibited the ability to image a vast range of biological species in live cells and small animals with high spatiotemporal resolution. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of biological systems, in which a wide variety of cells, biomacromolecules, cell metabolites and ions coexist, some challenges remain.</p>
        <p>(1) Reaction-based fluorescent probes react with analytes in an irreversible manner. This produces a monotonic signal increase with limited sensitivity. In addition, this limits the amount of information that can be obtained during a single study. Alternative strategies that have been developed to mitigate these limitations include continuous signal outputs achieved by cascade amplification [221], multiresponsive fluorescent probes [222] and regeneration of probe molecules [223]. These strategies could be used for the detection of endogenous species that exist at low concentrations, for example H2S (30-100 μmol/L) [224], H2O2</p>
        <p>(1-10 nmol/L) [225] and NO (100 pmol/L-5 nmol/L) [226].</p>
        <p>(2) Despite the extensive development of two-photon (or multiphoton) microscopic techniques. In vivo imaging using two-photon fluorescent probes still suffer from limited tissue penetration depths. This problem could be potentially addressed by means of chemiluminescence [227], Cerenkov luminescence [228], afterglow luminescence [229], and fluorescence lifetime imaging [230].</p>
        <p>(3) NIR I/II-emissive fluorescent probes based on organic dyes have been developed to obtain high resolution in vivo [231,232]. However, very few scaffolds have been reported. An alternative strategy could be the conversion of photonic energy to photoacoustic [233] or other signal modules [234], which can result in a significantly enhanced penetration depth of detection signal.</p>
        <p>(4) Fluorescence-guided surgery has become attractive for tumor resection [4,235,236].</p>
        <p>Indocyanine green (ICG) is the most frequently used imaging agent for fluorescence-guided surgery [237,238], however, we anticipate that in the near future other fluorescent probes that can differentiate between healthy tissue and cancerous tissue will receive clinical approval.</p>
        <p>This greater precision should significantly improve the prognosis and recovery (postoperative) of cancer patients.</p>
        <p>(5) Similar to drug molecules, when metabolized by the "cell factory" in the human body, fluorescent probes can be structurally converted to many unknown substances that could result in biosafety concerns. Systematic pharmacokinetic and biosafety analyses are needed for a fluorescent imaging probe before entering clinical trials. This is also important for those probes developed for basic studies since the fluorescence signal detected in cells might not originate directly from the original probe after interaction with the biospecies of interest. More in-depth research into the precise structural transformations of fluorescent probes in different cell types might also lead to new discoveries that contribute to the study of cell metabolism.</p>
        <p>(6) Fluorescent probes developed for enzymes implicated in post-translational modifications are mainly concerned with hydrolases (enzymes that remove a chemical group from a biomolecule). This is due to the relatively ease in the design of bond-cleavage based fluorescent probes through the modulation of electron and energy transfer processes in a conjugated dye system. However, fluorescent probes for kinases and transferases (enzymes that add a chemical substance onto a biomolecule) are particularly challenging since these catalytic reactions commonly take place on the sidechain of several amino acid residues of a protein of interest including serine, threonine, tyrosine, lysine and cysteine. The current approach to address this issue is the use of non-natural amino acids and carbohydrates that can be metabolically introduced to biomolecules, followed by bioorthogonal chemical labelling (the majority use click chemistry) [239][240][241]. Therefore, how to achieve the selective detection of a specific transferase activity in cells with non-genetically encoded small-molecule fluorescent probes remains a significant challenge in the field. The differentiation of structurally and functionally similar enzymatic subtypes in cells also requires additional assistance from biophysical techniques and computational science.</p>
        <p>(7) To date, a number of small-molecule fluorescent probes have been exploited for the construction of theranostic probes towards concerted disease diagnosis and therapy [242]. For an overview of the progress made in this area, please refer to the following literature reports concerning: tumor ablation by photodynamic therapy (PDT) [6,243,244]; sonodynamic therapy (SDT) [245,246]; chemodynamic therapy (CDT) [247][248][249]; photothermal therapy (PTT) [250][251][252]; and the interrogation of major organ diseases [253,254]. Due to their merits in terms of structural variability, ease of implementation, minimal invasiveness and biocompatibility, small-molecule fluorescent probes have proven useful for cancer theranostics. However, the limited penetration ability of the excitation light still restricts their clinical translation. As such the development of theranostic agents that can be activated by light with enhanced penetration ability or by other chemical forces are urgently required.</p>
        <p>Despite the abovementioned problems remaining to be overcome, we envision that the importance of fluorescent probes will continue to increase in the context of basic chemical biological studies and disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>
