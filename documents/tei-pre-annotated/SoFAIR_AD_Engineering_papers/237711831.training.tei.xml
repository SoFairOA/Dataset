        <p>Tactile sensing is an essential component in human-robot interaction and object manipulation. Soft sensors allow for safe interaction and improved gripping performance. Here we present the TacTip family of sensors: a range of soft optical tactile sensors with various morphologies fabricated through dual-material 3D printing. All of these sensors are inspired by the same biomimetic design principle: transducing deformation of the sensing surface via movement of pins analogous to the function of intermediate ridges within the human fingertip. The performance of the TacTip, TacTip-GR2, TacTip-M2, and TacCylinder sensors is here evaluated and shown to attain submillimeter accuracy on a rolling cylinder task, representing greater than 10-fold super-resolved acuity. A version of the TacTip sensor has also been open-sourced, enabling other laboratories to adopt it as a platform for tactile sensing and manipulation research. These sensors are suitable for real-world applications in tactile perception, exploration, and manipulation, and will enable further research and innovation in the field of soft tactile sensing.Tactile sensing is an essential component in human-robot interaction and object manipulation.

        <p>A large variety of tactile sensors have been developed over the years, 4 relying on various technologies such as capacitive taxels, resistive wires, and piezoelectric materials. However, there is a general lack of cheap customizable tactile sensors in the field, which is hampering the ease of researching applications of robot touch. We aim to develop these types of tactile sensors and make them available through open resources such as the soft robotics toolkit. 5 Our sensors are soft, with a compliant modular tip that protects sensitive electronic parts from physical contact with objects. When integrated into robotic grippers, compliant sensors have also been shown to improve grasping. 6 Developing soft sensors is also key for safe and comfortable human-robot interaction. 3 Advances in multimaterial 3D printing allow researchers to manufacture rapidly prototyped robot hands and sensors with integrated soft surfaces for compliant, adaptable, and sensorized manipulation. Recent work in the application of soft, 3D-printed tactile sensors, for instance, in demonstrating tactile super-resolution, 7 extends the scope of these devices from prototypes to useful, working versions of sensors whose materials and morphologies can be quickly, easily, and cheaply adapted to suit different practical applications.A large variety of tactile sensors have been developed over the years, 4 relying on various technologies such as capacitive taxels, resistive wires, and piezoelectric materials.

        <p>The aim of this study is to present a suite of soft sensors of various morphologies using 3D printing, including the tactile fingertip (TacTip) by successive modifications of the original cast tip version (Fig. 1). The TacTip 8 is a low-cost, robust, 3D-printed optical tactile sensor based on a human fingertip and developed at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL). We also introduce the TacTip-M2, TacTip-GR2, and TacCylinder (Fig. 2), more skin-like derived sensors whose fabrication is made possible by multimaterial 3D printing and which are designed for integration in two-fingered grippers and for capsule endoscopy, respectively.The aim of this study is to present a suite of soft sensors of various morphologies using 3D printing, including the tactile fingertip (TacTip) by successive modifications of the original cast tip version (Fig. 1).

        <p>We have open-sourced the open TacTip (www.soft roboticstoolkit.com/tactip) to offer other research institutions the opportunity to adopt and adapt our sensor designs, such as to create different morphologies, as we have done with the TacCylinder. 9 The sensor design can also be modified to integrate with robot hands, as demonstrated with the TacTip-M2 (formerly TacThumb) 10 and TacTip-GR2.We have open-sourced the open TacTip (www.soft roboticstoolkit.com/tactip) to offer other research institutions the opportunity to adopt and adapt our sensor designs, such as to create different morphologies, as we have done with the TacCylinder. 9 The sensor design can also be modified to integrate with robot hands, as demonstrated with the TacTip-M2 (formerly TacThumb) 10 and TacTip-GR2.</p>
        <p>This article presents the first comparative study of our suite of soft sensors, all of which are highly accurate, being able to localize objects to submillimeter accuracy that demonstrates super-resolved acuity. This high performance of the TacTip family of sensors suggests that analogous designs could result in a range of novel soft complex tactile sensors from regions of tactile skin to tactile feet and proboscises.This article presents the first comparative study of our suite of soft sensors, all of which are highly accurate, being able to localize objects to submillimeter accuracy that demonstrates super-resolved acuity.

        <p>Most tactile sensors are soft, comprising at least some compliant elements, and rely on a variety of underlying technologies (e.g., strain-gauge, 11 barometric, 12 capacitive, 13 piezoresistive, 14 piezoelectric 15 .) to transmit and record tactile information. Here we review existing compliant optical tactile sensors, which relate most closely to our family of TacTip sensors.Most tactile sensors are soft, comprising at least some compliant elements, and rely on a variety of underlying technologies (e.g., strain-gauge, 11 barometric, 12 capacitive, 13 piezoresistive, 14 piezoelectric 15 .) to transmit and record tactile information.

        <p>At first glance, the design of the Optoforce force/torque sensor (www.optoforce.com) seems closely related to the TacTip, based on its overall shape and design. However, the Optoforce is designed to compute only the overall force and torque of the contact, rather than relaying tactile information that comprises an array of sensor readings across a sensing surface. Force/torque sensing is unlike human touch and inadequate for tasks requiring more information than a force vector, such as multicontact sensing.At first glance, the design of the Optoforce force/torque sensor (www.optoforce.com) seems closely related to the TacTip, based on its overall shape and design.

        <p>An early precursor to the TacTip used a molded transparent dome with a black dotted pattern. 16 However, the use of ambient light for imaging the dots has drawbacks, including lack of contrast on objects that obscure the ambient lighting and difficulties for automated tracking of the dots; moreover, the design presents difficulties for image recognition of tactile elements independent of lighting conditions.An early precursor to the TacTip used a molded transparent dome with a black dotted pattern. 16 However, the use of ambient light for imaging the dots has drawbacks, including lack of contrast on objects that obscure the ambient lighting and difficulties for automated tracking of the dots; moreover, the design presents difficulties for image recognition of tactile elements independent of lighting conditions.</p>
        <p>A further tactile sensor based on optics is the GelSight sensor, 17 which uses colored lights and photometric stereo to reconstruct highly accurate deformations of its surface. This sensor obtains high resolutions, uses inexpensive materials, and can be made into a portable device. While in many ways it represents an excellent, low-cost optical tactile sensor, it presently requires a flat surface and there would be challenges in adapting it to more complex morphologies such as domed fingertips. Similar considerations apply to the Gel-Force sensor, 18 where the sensing surface is a flat elastomer pad.A further tactile sensor based on optics is the GelSight sensor, 17 which uses colored lights and photometric stereo to reconstruct highly accurate deformations of its surface.

        <p>Other examples include tactile sensors that use an optical waveguide approach, [19][20][21] or patterns of dots 22 or lines 23 drawn on the inside surface of a flexible skin, tracked by a CCD camera. Some sensors also make use of fiber optics to relay light intensities to the camera, 24 allowing the sensor's contact area to be made very small, ideal for medical applications.Other examples include tactile sensors that use an optical waveguide approach, [19][20][21] or patterns of dots 22 or lines 23 drawn on the inside surface of a flexible skin, tracked by a CCD camera.

        <p>All tactile sensors have their pros and cons, and ultimately, the best choice will depend on the application. That being said, an important distinction between the TacTip and the sensors described above is the presence of physical pins attached to the sensing surface; these structures mimic intermediate ridges within the human fingertip, giving a biomimetic basis for the sensor design, as described below.All tactile sensors have their pros and cons, and ultimately, the best choice will depend on the application.

        <p>When the human finger makes contact with an object or surface, deformation occurs in the epidermal layers of the skin and the change is detected and relayed by its mechanoreceptors. 1 Chorley et al. 8 were inspired to consider the behavior of the human glabrous (hairless) skin, as found on the palms of human hands and soles of our feet. They built on previous research showing that the Merkel cell complex of sensory receptors works in tandem with the morphology of the intermediate ridges (Fig. 3) to provide edge encoding of a contacted surface. The TacTip device seeks to replicate this response by substituting intermediate ridges with internal pins on the underside of its soft, skin-like membrane, with optical pin tracking via an internal camera taking the place of mechanosensory transduction of the sensing surface (Fig. 4).When the human finger makes contact with an object or surface, deformation occurs in the epidermal layers of the skin and the change is detected and relayed by its mechanoreceptors. 1 Chorley et al. 8 were inspired to consider the behavior of the human glabrous (hairless) skin, as found on the palms of human hands and soles of our feet.

        <p>This biomimetic inspiration was recently extended by exploring the role of an artificial fingerprint on tactile sensing with the TacTip. 25 In that study, an artificial fingerprint consisting of a series of outer nodules on the TacTip's skin was shown to enhance high spatial frequency detection. This finding suggests that the inclusion of artificial fingerprints in biomimetic fingertips will improve their ability to perform tactile tasks such as edge perception, contour following, and fine feature classification, with potential implications for object perception and tactile manipulation.This biomimetic inspiration was recently extended by exploring the role of an artificial fingerprint on tactile sensing with the TacTip. 25 In that study, an artificial fingerprint consisting of a series of outer nodules on the TacTip's skin was shown to enhance high spatial frequency detection.

        <p>The original TacTip 8 is a soft, robust, and high-sensitivity sensor making use of biomimetic methods for active perception. This sensor has been shown to achieve 40-fold localization super-resolution 7 and successfully perform tactile manipulation on a cylinder rolling task. 26 Further efforts to integrate the TacTip for use with 3Dprinted robot hands and grippers have led to the development of the TacTip-M2 10 and TacTip-GR2 sensors, integrated on the M2 gripper 26 and GR2 gripper, 27 respectively. These open-source robot hands developed at Yale's GRAB Lab enable the investigation of in-hand tactile manipulation with the TacTip sensors.The original TacTip 8 is a soft, robust, and high-sensitivity sensor making use of biomimetic methods for active perception.

        <p>In the original version of the open-TacTip, 7,8,29 the base, camera mount, and rigid part of the tip are 3D printed, the skin is cast in VytaFlex 60 silicone rubber, and the pins' tips are (painstakingly) painted white by hand.

        <p>To enhance the functionality of the open-TacTip, a series of modifications are made to the original version that was described above.

        <p>3D-printed skin. Rather than cast the TacTip's skin in silicone rubber, dual-material rapid prototyping with an Objet 3D printer is used to create the sensor's rigid base in hard plastic (Vero White) and its soft skin in a rubber-like material (Tango Black+). This lowers the cost and accelerates the creation of new prototype TacTip skins, by avoiding the time-consuming mold creation and skin casting/painting fabrication stages. In particular, Vero White tips are now printed directly onto the end of the pins avoiding the need to paint them. Examples of different types of skins include tips with a fingerprint 25 and a rotationally symmetric pin layout. 30 Three-dimensional printing also increases reproducibility of design. Differences in 3D-printed tip dimensions are based on the accuracy of the 3D printer. Conversely, in molded tips, the skin is molded by hand, introducing variability in skin thickness between tips. While one would expect that 3Dprinted skins would be less robust over the long term than their cast counterparts, we have used such 3D-printed skins over months on a daily basis with no obvious drop in performance. Damage is usually due to human error.3D-printed skin.

        <p>The new printing method also provides the opportunity to add complex features to the sensor's skin. For instance, an exterior fingerprint of rubber nodules was included that mechanically coupled to the white pin tips through rigid internal plastic cores. The creation of this complex skin structure was made possible through the use of multimaterial 3D printing and has been shown to improve perceptual acuity at high spatial frequencies. 31 Modularity. To facilitate skin testing and optimization, the skin is printed in a single structure attached to a hard plastic casing (Fig. 4, right panel), forming a tip that connects to the TacTip base with a bayonet mount. The tip (made up of the skin, gel, lens, and plastic casing) is thus a modular component of the sensor, which is easily replaceable or upgradable. By printing tips in this way, it is possible to produce and test different pin layouts and tip structures to optimize the sensor capabilities at a much lower cost than has been possible previously.The new printing method also provides the opportunity to add complex features to the sensor's skin.

        <p>We are thus able to update the pin layout to a hexagonal projection of 127 pins with a regular spacing when imaged by the camera, an improvement over the uniform geodesic distribution that had been used in past molded TacTips (Fig. 5). This design gives better performance of the pin tracking algorithms during image processing. We also experimented with different skin thicknesses and pin lengths, eventually converging on a 1 mm thick skin with 2.0 mm long pins for the improved TacTip (3°taper) as a good balance between robustness and sensitivity of the pins to deflection. 3D printing was essential in enabling these trial-and-error experiments requiring extensive hardware testing and leading to an improved sensor design.We are thus able to update the pin layout to a hexagonal projection of 127 pins with a regular spacing when imaged by the camera, an improvement over the uniform geodesic distribution that had been used in past molded TacTips (Fig. 5).

        <p>Shorter sensor. A more compact sensor is both easier to deploy in practical scenarios and facilitates integration with a wider range of robot hands and arms. Another important benefit is to reduce the torque on the base if struck laterally, which would be an issue for a long sensor. Thus, we take apart the webcam, retaining only the essential components, and reconnect its circuit boards in a horizontal arrangement (Fig. 4). This shortens the spread along the sensor's long axis, reducing the TacTip's height by approximately a factor FIG. 5. Raw images from the TacTip family of sensors. From left to right: improved TacTip, TacTip-GR2, TacTip-M2, and TacCylinder. The TacTip images pins with a Microsoft Cinema HD webcam, whereas the TacTip-GR2 uses a Raspberry Pi spycam (Adafruit) and a fisheye lens to reduce the sensor's form factor. The TacCylinder uses a catadioptric mirror to achieve 360°vision. of 2 (from 161 to 85 mm). The base and camera mount are also combined into a single piece to simplify the overall sensor design (Fig. 4, middle panel).

        <p>The pin layout of the modular tips is maintained for this version of the TacTip, but a flatter skin component creates more space between the gripper's fingers, allowing larger objects to be grasped by the gripper.The pin layout of the modular tips is maintained for this version of the TacTip, but a flatter skin component creates more space between the gripper's fingers, allowing larger objects to be grasped by the gripper.</p>

        <p>TacTip-M2. Applying TacTip design principles to the OpenHand model M2 gripper, 26 we created the TacTip-M2, 10 an elongated tactile thumb (Fig. 6) for application to in-hand dexterous manipulation of an object using only tactile feedback as guidance. We believe tactile manipulation to be an essential component in allowing robots to effectively interact with objects in complex, dynamic environments. The M2 gripper was chosen for integration as it is 3D printed and open source, has good grasping capability, and provides an opportunity for simple tactile manipulation to be investigated along one dimension.TacTip-M2.

This experiment was chosen because it is simple to set up for all tactile sensors and was also compatible with the range of different designs, morphologies, and uses of the sensors, from manipulation tasks with robot hands to contacting objects with stand-alone sensors.For validation of perceptual performance, we test the TacTip, TacTip-GR2, TacTip-M2, and TacCylinder sensors on the same cylinder rolling task, to evaluate localization performance for each sensor.

        <p>The sensors are attached as end-effectors to a 6-DOF ABB IRB120 industrial robot arm (Fig. 8), and brought into contact with a 25 mm diameter cylinder, by lowering the sensor's tip to 3 mm below its first point of contact with the cylinder. The cylinder is then horizontally rolled, with a custom platform constraining movements to one dimension (defined as y). The platform consists of a flat Perspex bottom plate, with two Perspex walls that constrain the cylinder to move along them (Fig. 8). A rubber surface is added to the bottom plate to ensure the cylinder does not slip while rolling. Magnets mounted at the ends of the cylinder and one end of the roller provide a home position for the cylinder. The cylinder is rolled forward in a nonslip motion in 0.1 mm increments over a 72 mm range, totaling 720 different locations along the y-axis.The sensors are attached as end-effectors to a 6-DOF ABB IRB120 industrial robot arm (Fig. 8), and brought into contact with a 25 mm diameter cylinder, by lowering the sensor's tip to 3 mm below its first point of contact with the cylinder.

        <p>At each location, 10 images are recorded (640 • 480 pixels (px), sampled at *20 fps). These images are then filtered and thresholded in 
            <rs type="software">OpenCV</rs> (
            <rs type="url">www.opencv.org</rs>), and the pin center coordinates are detected using a contour detection algorithm. Each pin is identified based on its proximity to a default set of pin positions recorded when the sensor is not in contact with the cylinder; if no pin is detected within a radius of 20 px from its default, the position from the previous frame is used instead. A time series of x-and y-deflections of the sensor's pins are then extracted and treated as individual taxel inputs. Several frames are collected to reduce noise arising from the pin detection algorithm and minor displacements of the sensor.

        <p>TacTip. As the TacTip rolls the cylinder across a flat surface in the y direction (as described in the Experimental Setup and Data Collection section), we note the pin deflections in the x-direction (perpendicular to cylinder movement direction) have a regular pattern, with successive rows of pins deflecting outward (deflection reaching -30 to 30 px) and then returning to baseline (Fig. 9A,B). The y-deflections of pins (in the direction of cylinder motion) display an irregular pattern, however, with all pins initially dipping downward before recovering sequentially to baseline positions. This FIG. 9. Tactile data from all four sensors. Data were sampled at 0.1 mm intervals along the 72 mm range of cylinder motion (720 samples).

        <p>TacTip-GR2. Data acquired from the TacTip-GR2 produced similar patterns of x-and y-deflections to the TacTip, although deflections are less pronounced (Fig. 9C,D). This is most visible in the x-direction, with an approximate deflection range of -12 to 12 px for the TacTip-GR2 (c.f. -30 to 30 px for the TacTip).TacTip-GR2.

        <p>We note that the pins which contact the cylinder first (red and orange in Fig. 9) have the largest y-deflections in the TacTip case, whereas in the TacTip-GR2 data, the pins in the middle of the sensor (yellow and green in Fig. 9) are the most deflected in the y direction. This difference is a consequence of the shape of the sensors, with the TacTip's dome-shaped tip creating large y-deflections close to the initial contact. The TacTip-GR2 is mostly flat with a slight bulge around its center, creating a central area in which internal dynamics enables larger deflections. Note that these dome-shaped morphologies also explain the greater deflections of central pins (yellow and green) relative to pins around the sensors' edges (dark red, dark blue).We note that the pins which contact the cylinder first (red and orange in Fig. 9) have the largest y-deflections in the TacTip case, whereas in the TacTip-GR2 data, the pins in the middle of the sensor (yellow and green in Fig. 9) are the most deflected in the y direction.

        <p>TacTip-M2. Data from the TacTip-M2 have a regular, repeated sinusoidal pattern, with a deflection range of -9 to 4 px in the x-direction and more pronounced deflections (-14 to 6 px) in the y-direction (Fig. 9E,F). This makes sense as it is the direction of movement of the cylinder, and is also the direction with most freedom of movement for pins, since it corresponds to the sensor's long axis. The sinusoidal pattern arises from the synchronized movement of rows of pins on the TacTip-M2 as the cylinder moves across them.TacTip-M2.

        <p>An asymmetry is also noticeable in both the x-and ydirections, with the magnitude of x-deflections increasing as the cylinder is rolled forward, and peaks of the sinusoidal pattern in the y-deflections gradually migrating downward from +8 to +2 px. This is likely due to the intrinsic mechanical asymmetry of the TacTip-M2, arising from the way in which the skin and base connect at each end of the sensor (Fig. 6).An asymmetry is also noticeable in both the x-and ydirections, with the magnitude of x-deflections increasing as the cylinder is rolled forward, and peaks of the sinusoidal pattern in the y-deflections gradually migrating downward from +8 to +2 px.

        <p>TacCylinder. Data for the TacCylinder show a regular pattern of deflections (-6 to 2 px in the x-direction), which is greater in the y-direction (-4 to 12 px) (Fig. 9G,H). We only consider pins from the lower half of the TacCylinder, as the pins on the top half are unaffected by contact with the cylinder. We note a slight initial increase and then decrease of the peak amplitudes of deflections in the y-direction, showing that lower pins with more pressure applied are deflected further.TacCylinder.

        <p>Thus, we can observe from the data gathered in this experiment from all four sensors that sensor morphology has a huge impact on the aspect and quality of collected data. The overall pattern of pin deflections, their relative and absolute amplitudes, and the order in which they deflect are all strongly dependent on sensor morphology. The next section explores how these differences affect performance on cylinder localization.Thus, we can observe from the data gathered in this experiment from all four sensors that sensor morphology has a huge impact on the aspect and quality of collected data.

        <p>TacTip. Localization performance of the TacTip is tested using the validation procedure detailed in the Materials and Methods (Validation section), and results are summarized in Table 2. The localization accuracy is an average e y ¼ 0:20 mm over all location classes (Fig. 10A), and is below 1 mm everywhere. Considering the closest pins on the TacTip skin (in the center) are spaced 2.4 mm apart, and the x-and y-deflections of these pins act as taxels, we consider the resolution of the sensor to be 2.4 mm. As such, the TacTip demonstrates *12-fold super-resolution 7 over the cylinder's movement range.TacTip.

The TacTip-GR2's localization accuracy averages e y ¼ 0:16 mm and remains below 0.3 mm over the entire range (Fig. 10B), corresponding to 15-fold superresolution over the pin spacing of 2.4 mm. We interpret this slight improvement in localization relative to the TacTip sensor as a consequence of the flat surface of the TacTip-GR2 creating a more consistent pattern of pin deflections over the cylinder location range (Fig. 9).TacTip-GR2.

        <p>We tested four 3D-printed sensors on a cylinder rolling task: the TacTip, TacTip-GR2, TacTip-M2, and TacCylinder. We found that all four sensors were able to localize the cylinder with submillimeter accuracy. All four sensors demonstrated above 10-fold super-resolution, with the TacTip-GR2 performing best (although it also had a closer pin spacing than the TacCylinder), possibly because its morphology is the most suited to a rolling task.We tested four 3D-printed sensors on a cylinder rolling task: the TacTip, TacTip-GR2, TacTip-M2, and TacCylinder.

        <p>All the TacTip sensors utilize the same working principle, yet their different morphologies yield appreciable differences in behavior. These results reinforce the validity of the tight link between shape and function in a sensor and show the advantage of using 3D-printing techniques, which allow morphological customization. In particular, multimaterial printing enables a full sensor to be 3D printed, including its soft skin, opening up further possibilities of experimentation with different materials and morphologies. The sensor's compliance could be adjusted for different tasks by modifying the 3D-printed skin material and the shore hardness of silicone gel used in the tip. Further experiments on parameters such as pin length, pin spacing, and pin width could also reveal optimal solutions for TacTip designs applied to specific tasks. The TacTip-M2 and TacCylinder sensors could be made modular to facilitate these experiments. Directions for future work include accelerating the data processing algorithm and overall control loop to establish tasks with continuous, uninterrupted motion and miniaturizing the TacTip further for integration into a wide range of robotic hands.All the TacTip sensors utilize the same working principle, yet their different morphologies yield appreciable differences in behavior.

In particular, multimaterial printing enables a full sensor to be 3D printed, including its soft skin, opening up further possibilities of experimentation with different materials and morphologies. The sensor's compliance could be adjusted for different tasks by modifying the 3D-printed skin material and the shore hardness of silicone gel used in the tip. Further experiments on parameters such as pin length, pin spacing, and pin width could also reveal optimal solutions for TacTip designs applied to specific tasks. The TacTip-M2 and TacCylinder sensors could be made modular to facilitate these experiments.

        <p>To encourage the use of the TacTip design principles for new tactile sensing applications, we have open-sourced the hardware on the soft robotics toolkit (www.softrobotic stoolkit.com/tactip) along with fabrication instructions. This submission won the ''2016 contributions to soft robotics research'' prize and aims to provide open access to cheap customizable tactile sensors, which are currently lacking from the field. It is our intention that research groups will use and develop TacTip sensors, and take advantage of 3Dprinting technologies to apply our design principles to novel sensors and systems of their own devising.To encourage the use of the TacTip design principles for new tactile sensing applications, we have open-sourced the hardware on the soft robotics toolkit (www.softrobotic stoolkit.com/tactip) along with fabrication instructions.
