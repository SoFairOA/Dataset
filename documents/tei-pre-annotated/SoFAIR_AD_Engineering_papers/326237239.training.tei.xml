        <p>The study is focused on multifunctional performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) reinforced PEEK composites enabled via fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing (AM) utilizing in-house nanoengineered filaments. Thermo-physical, mechanical and wear characteristics of electroconductive PEEK nanocomposites are reported. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is found to decrease by 26% and 18% with the incorporation of 5 wt% GNP and 3 wt% CNT into PEEK polymer, respectively. The decrease in CTE provides better dimensional stability to resulting nanocomposite structures. Due to uniform dispersion of CNT and GNP in the PEEK matrix, the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity are both increased. The 3D printed PEEK nanocomposites reveal interfacial voids between the beads and intra-bead pores and thus exhibit lower density compared to that of the 3D printed neat PEEK. Young's and storage moduli are found to increase by 20% and 66% for 3 wt% CNT loading and by 23% and 72% for 5 wt% GNP loading respectively. However, the PEEK nanocomposites exhibit similar tensile strength to that of neat PEEK. The coefficient of friction obtained from fretting wear tests is found to decrease by 67% and 56% for 1 wt% CNT and 3 wt% GNP loaded PEEK nanocomposites, respectively and the decrease is attributed to reduced hardness and increased porosity. Multifunctional performance of carbon nanostructures reinforced AM-enabled PEEK composites demonstrated here makes them suitable for a range of applications such as orthopedics, oil and gas, automotive, electronics and space.The study is focused on multifunctional performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) reinforced PEEK composites enabled via fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing (AM) utilizing in-house nanoengineered filaments.

        <p>Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fabrication of complex geometries through layer-by-layer formation and is rapidly advancing towards new materials and applications [1,2]. AM offers user friendly and low-cost fabrication route that provides greater flexibility to locally design the material architecture in three-dimensions [3][4][5][6]. Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most popular AM technique for thermoplastics due to its relative simplicity and low-cost. In FFF process, the filament feedstock is fed into a heated nozzle where the polymer is fused and subsequently deposited on to a heated plate to form a 3D part, following a predefined 3D slicing pattern.Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fabrication of complex geometries through layer-by-layer formation and is rapidly advancing towards new materials and applications [1,2].

        <p>Despite abundant availability of FFF machines, only a few are suitable for 3D printing high performance polymers, such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), etc., as they process at high temperature. These polymers exhibit superior mechanical properties as well as high thermal and chemical resistance [7]. Among the high performance polymers, PEEK, a semi-crystalline polymer is suitable for many engineering applications, such as biomedical implants, due to its biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, radiopacity, excellent fatigue and wear resistance [8]. PEEK is also utilized for space applications as PEEK has low outgassing property and lightweight relative to metals [9]. PEEK and PEEK composites are also used in oil and gas industries for gaskets and seals. These components interact with potentially harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures and high pressures, corrosive fluids and gases, lubricating oils and solvents [10]. The drawbacks of PEEK are higher cost (compared to other commodity thermoplastics), high processing temperature (above 350 � C) and the processing difficulties associated with its semi-crystallinity. FFF technique has been successfully utilized to fabricate PEEK [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. The expensive selective laser sintering (SLS) AM technique has also been utilized to fabricate PEEK [18].Despite abundant availability of FFF machines, only a few are suitable for 3D printing high performance polymers, such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), etc., as they process at high temperature.

        <p>Precursor materials (e.g., filament, mixed photo-resin) containing micro and/or nano-fillers, such as carbon fiber [19,20], carbon black [21], GNP [22,23], CNT [24], montmorillonite [25], stainless steel, bronze and copper powders [26,27], glass microspheres and nanoclay [28], and wood flour [27] are increasingly being developed to realize AM-enabled composites. The main idea is to harness the synergistic effects of their constituents and their tailorable microstructure to realize lightweight composites with superior mechanical, electrical, thermal and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) properties. Strong parts with low CTE are desirable to ensure dimensional stability. However, typical polymers possess high CTE. It was found that the PEEK CTE can be reduced by the incorporation of low CTE and high thermal conductivity Al 2 O 3 particles [29]. Additionally, polymers reinforced with electrically conductive nanofibers, such as GNP and/or CNT have also been explored for their functional performance, such as for temperature, strain and damage-sensing [30][31][32][33][34]. Stepashkin et al. [19]. reported that Carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK composites fabricated by FFF process exhibit 25-30% lower thermal conductivity than cast CF/PEEK composites. Anisotropy of thermal properties was observed, as the short carbon fibers get oriented along the FFF deposition path. Berretta et al. [35]. fabricated PEEK nanocomposites reinforced with 1 wt% and 5 wt% CNT by FFF process and found that the incorporation of CNT into the PEEK matrix, does not influence the mechanical performance of the PEEK nanocomposites.

        <p>The reinforcement of PEEK with CNT and GNP also influences the tribological characteristics of resulting PEEK composites. For example, addition of GNP into PEEK was found to reduce the coefficient of friction by 38% of the nanocomposite due to the lubrication action of GNP [37]. In another study, incorporation of CNT into PEEK matrix was found to result in a ~24% reduction in the friction compared to the neat PEEK [38]. The microscale wear (known as fretting wear) test is usually performed to assess the tribological performance of PEEK and PEEK nanocomposites used especially for artificial joints in orthopedics and mechanical bearings [38]. Artificial joints, experience microscale oscillatory movements between the mating surfaces [39][40][41]. Fretting wear analysis can predict the possibility of loosening of the implant due to wear at the joints [42].The reinforcement of PEEK with CNT and GNP also influences the tribological characteristics of resulting PEEK composites.

        <p>To manufacture filament of an appropriate size for use in FFF machines, a filament extrusion system consisting of a twin-screw extruder, water bath, a customized filament puller, and a winding device was setup as shown in Fig. S1. To achieve precise speed control, the filament puller consists of a potentiometer, an Arduino controller, and a stepper motor. For extrusion, a Thermo Scientific Process 11 parallel co-rotating twin-screw extruder was used to melt compound the CNT/PEEK (1 and 3 wt%) and GNP/PEEK (3 and 5 wt%). To ensure a homogenous dispersion, formulations with varying concentrations were stir mixed prior to melt compounding. It is interesting to note that the GNP/PEEK compound with 3-5 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK compound with 1 wt% CNT showed good melt processability, whereas CNT/PEEK compound with 3 wt% CNT was very viscous. Viscous compound, due to its unstable melt flow, makes the filament diameter non-uniform. This in turn influences the printability of filaments and the properties of printed parts. The weight fraction of carbon nanostructures is chosen such that they form electrically percolating network in the resulting nanocomposite (electrical conductivity σ ¼ 9.1 � 10 7 S/cm for 1 wt% CNT) but still small enough for the nanocomposite to remain biocompatible.To manufacture filament of an appropriate size for use in FFF machines, a filament extrusion system consisting of a twin-screw extruder, water bath, a customized filament puller, and a winding device was setup as shown in Fig. S1.

        <p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Netzsch) were performed under nitrogen atmosphere to study the melting and crystallization behavior of neat PEEK and in-house nanoengineered PEEK filaments. The samples were heated from 30 � C to 430 � C at a heating rate of 10 � C/min and then maintained isothermally at 430 � C for 5 min before cooling the samples to 30 � C at the same rate of 10 � C/ min. Subsequently after soaking isothermally for 5 min at 30 � C, the samples underwent a 2nd heating cycle. The melting temperature and heat of fusion data were obtained from the 2nd heating cycle to eliminate the influence of any thermal history and for a better surface contact between the solid sample and the DSC crucible. The degree of crystallinity X c of the samples was calculated using X c ¼ ΔH c � 100= ðΔH 0 c wÞ, where ΔH c is the heat of crystallization and ΔH 0 c is the heat of crystallization of 100% crystalline PEEK (130 J/g [44]), and w is the mass fraction of PEEK in the nanocomposites.Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Netzsch) were performed under nitrogen atmosphere to study the melting and crystallization behavior of neat PEEK and in-house nanoengineered PEEK filaments.

The CTE of the samples was determined using Dilatometer DIL 802 from Bahr Thermoanalyse. The temperature was varied from 30 to 200 � C with a scan rate of 5 � C/min. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 5 mm and length of 50 mm were analyzed (see Fig. S3). The CTE was estimated from the relationship: ΔL=L 0 ¼ CTE* ΔT, where ΔL=L 0 is the average thermal strain along the length of the sample and ΔT is the change in temperature.

        <p>DSC was performed on filament feedstocks (see, Fig. 2). The melting temperature (T m ), crystallization temperature (T c ), heat of fusion ðΔH m Þ, heat of crystallization ðΔH c Þ; and degree of crystallinity ðX c Þ of neat PEEK and the PEEK nanocomposite filaments were analyzed (see, Table 1). The CNT and GNP reinforced PEEK exhibit a shift in melting and crystallization peaks to a higher temperature compared to the unreinforced PEEK. The T m is increased by 1 � C and 2 � C with the addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. The T c shows higher temperature shift than T m as the T c increases by 3-4 � C and 5-6 � C with addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. It indicates that the presence of CNT and GNP in PEEK facilitates PEEK crystallization. This is further confirmed by the increase in degree of crystallinity of GNP/PEEK with 3 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 1 wt% CNT. The nano-reinforcements serve as nucleating agents permitting molecular chains of PEEK to pack into a closer arrangement [45,46]. Higher loading of nano-reinforcements (GNP/PEEK with 5 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 3 wt% CNT) exhibit negligible increase in degree of crystallinity. This could be due to the agglomeration of CNT and GNP. Agglomeration reduces the effective contact surface area between the nano-reinforcements and the matrix.DSC was performed on filament feedstocks (see, Fig. 2).

The CNT and GNP reinforced PEEK exhibit a shift in melting and crystallization peaks to a higher temperature compared to the unreinforced PEEK. The T m is increased by 1 � C and 2 � C with the addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. The T c shows higher temperature shift than T m as the T c increases by 3-4 � C and 5-6 � C with addition of GNP and CNT, respectively. It indicates that the presence of CNT and GNP in PEEK facilitates PEEK crystallization. This is further confirmed by the increase in degree of crystallinity of GNP/PEEK with 3 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 1 wt% CNT. The nano-reinforcements serve as nucleating agents permitting molecular chains of PEEK to pack into a closer arrangement [45,46]. Higher loading of nano-reinforcements (GNP/PEEK with 5 wt% GNP and CNT/PEEK with 3 wt% CNT) exhibit negligible increase in degree of crystallinity. This could be due to the agglomeration of CNT and GNP. Agglomeration reduces the effective contact surface area between the nano-reinforcements and the matrix.</p>
        <p>Fracture surfaces of tensile specimens were examined to investigate the morphology and dispersion state of the GNP and CNT in PEEK matrix. Figs. 3 and4 show the SEM images of base PEEK, GNP/PEEK, and CNT/PEEK samples at low (contain several beads) and high magnification, respectively. Fig. 3a shows smooth, brittle-like fracture surface of the base PEEK samples. The interfaces between beads of the base PEEK are not well identifiable, signifying a relatively good adhesion between beads. CNT/PEEK specimen shows surface morphology similar to that of the base PEEK, but with more visible interfaces between beads (Fig. 3c). This indicates that CNT/PEEK sample has more interfacial voids between the beads compared with base PEEK and thus lower interfacial strength. GNP/PEEK sample (see, Figs. 3b and4b) exhibits a morphology different to those of base PEEK and CNT/PEEK, indicating that the addition of GNP promotes ductility of the nanocomposite. Fig. 4 shows high magnification SEM images of the base PEEK, GNP/PEEK, and CNT/PEEK. It can be seen that CNT and GNP are uniformly dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Moreover, GNP/PEEK composite has large extent of micro and nano-pores. It is worth noting that in all samples, voids with diameters ranging from 50 to 150 μm are observed (see SI, Fig. S4). This is commonly observed in FFF process, arising due to issues, such as non-uniformity of the filament diameter and non-uniform flow of polymer melt.Fracture surfaces of tensile specimens were examined to investigate the morphology and dispersion state of the GNP and CNT in PEEK matrix.

        <p>It can be seen from Table 2 that the density of the filament feedstock slightly increases with increasing CNT and GNP content. This is due to higher density of CNT (1.6 g/cm 3 ) and GNP (2.267 g/cm 3 ) than that of the PEEK. All FFF-fabricated nanocomposites exhibit lower density than those of the filament feedstocks. The reduced density of FFF-samples is due to the formation of multiscale voids both within the beads and at the interfaces between the beads during layer-by-layer build-up of the samples. It is interesting to note that horizontally fabricated samples Fig. 2.

        <p>The polymer melt in vertically fabricated sample is deposited onto a small cross-sectional area, as seen in Fig. 1. Therefore, the deposition time in the x y plane is very short prior to moving in the z -direction. This allows a good degree of compaction of the sample, resulting in higher density, since the polymer is deposited onto a layer that is still in a molten or partially molten state. The deposition time in the x y plane of the horizontally fabricated sample is more than that of the vertically fabricated sample. Therefore, it is likely that the bead is deposited on to a solidified preceding layer, resulting in lower degree of compaction of the specimen. Significant difference in density is particularly observed for reinforced nanocomposites. For similar FFF process parameters such as the nozzle movement speed, nozzle temperature and layer height, the mass flow rate of material dispensed through the nozzle for nanoengineered filaments is lower than that for neat PEEK filament. This is due to the increased viscosity and change in flow behavior of fused nanocomposite. Therefore, the extent of interfacial voids between beads of the nanocomposites is higher than that of the base PEEK. This leads to reduced density of the nano-reinforced PEEK composites compared to base PEEK. Moreover, presence of micro and nano-pores within beads are prevalent especially in GNP/PEEK composites, contributing to reduced density of the nano-reinforced PEEK composites.The polymer melt in vertically fabricated sample is deposited onto a small cross-sectional area, as seen in Fig. 1.

        <p>The thermal expansion behavior of the samples is influenced by CNT/GNP content, as well as the fabrication configuration. In this study, we measure an average CTE considering thermal expansion only along the longitudinal direction. As seen from Fig. 5, the specimen elongates as the temperature is constantly increased. Two distinct regions, separated by change in slope of strain ΔL=L 0 vs. temperature increase ΔT are observed. This corresponds to the temperature below and above T g . The CTE was estimated by evaluating the slope of ΔL=L 0 vs. ΔT, below and above T g . Table 3 summarizes CTE of neat PEEK and PEEK composites with CNT and GNP reinforcements for both horizontal and vertical fabrication configurations. One can see that for temperature below T g , the CTE of PEEK nanocomposite decreases by 16% and 26% with the addition of 3 wt% GNP and 5 wt% GNP, respectively. Incorporation of CNT into the PEEK matrix reduces the CTE as well but to a lesser extent. The addition of 1 wt% and 3 wt% CNT reduces the CTE of PEEK nanocomposites by 9% and 18%, respectively. The CTE of the nanocomposite above T g is also evaluated. It should be noted that the mechanical performance of the reinforced PEEK nanocomposites becomes poor in this temperature regime, with a storage modulus of ~10 � lower than that below T g (see, Fig. 6). The extent of decrease in CTE of the samples with GNP remains the same relative to that below T g . However, CNT incorporated PEEK specimens above T g do not exhibit significant CTE changes compared to that of base PEEK. In summary, the horizontally printed nanocomposite samples exhibit lower CTE than the base PEEK, except for CNT reinforced PEEK above T g . The in-plane CTE of GNP and CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites is lower than that of the out-of-plane direction. This is optimally manifested by the horizontally fabricated samples since GNP and CNT tend to orient along the deposition path direction. Insignificant changes in CTE of CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites above T g could be due to different intrinsic thermal expansion property of CNT above T g .

        <p>The vertically fabricated samples exhibit different trend as compared to horizontally fabricated samples. GNP/PEEK samples show increase in CTE, while CNT/PEEK samples do not exhibit significant changes in CTE, both below and above T g . The CNT and GNP in vertically fabricated samples are oriented transversely to the specimen's longitudinal direction and thus intrinsically low CTE of CNT and GNP cannot be manifested by the composites.

        <p>The tensile performance of base and PEEK nanocomposites is summarized in Table 4. The stress-strain response of the samples are shown in Fig. S5. The Young's modulus of GNP and CNT reinforced PEEK nanocomposites increases with increase in nano-reinforcement content. However, the reinforced nanocomposites exhibit similar tensile strength to that of the base PEEK. The GNP/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit ductile fracture behavior while CNT/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit brittle fracture behavior, as discussed earlier in SEM morphology section. This is reflected in the strain at break and tensile toughness properties of the nanocomposites. Compared to base PEEK, the GNP/PEEK nanocomposites exhibit higher strain at break and toughness properties, while the CNT/PEEK nanocomposites show decreased performance. The Poisson's ratio of the base PEEK and CNT/PEEK nanocomposite samples are similar. However, GNP/PEEK nanocomposite exhibits lower Poisson's ratio. This could be attributed to the greater extent of micro-voids in GNP/PEEK samples, as indicated by SEM image presented in Fig. 4b. It should be noted that the mechanical properties of FFF-parts are influenced by factors such as the bead-bead interfacial strength, nanostructure-PEEK interfacial strength, dispersion state of the nanoreinforcement, interfacial voids between beads and the voids within the beads. The dominating factors that govern the mechanical properties of nano-reinforced FFF samples are the dispersion state of the nanoreinforcement and the interfacial strength between CNT/GNP and PEEK. The macroscopic density measurement presented in Table 2 is influenced by the density of the individual constituents (fiber and matrix), the intra-bead pores, the interfacial voids between beads and the compaction degree during processing.

        <p>DMA analysis for base and nano-reinforced PEEK composites were performed to examine the effect of nano-reinforcement and fabrication configuration on the thermomechanical properties of the PEEK nanocomposites. The storage modulus ðE'Þ and tan δ of the PEEK nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6. In horizontally fabricated samples, incorporation of GNP and CNT into the PEEK matrix increases the storage modulus in the glassy region (below T g ). The higher content of nano-reinforcement results in higher storage modulus. The storage modulus of the samples above T g reduces drastically, with no significant difference between the base and reinforced PEEK nanocomposites. In contrast, GNP and CNT reinforcements do not significantly influence the storage modulus of vertically fabricated samples in both regimes (below and above T g ). The improved storage modulus of horizontally fabricated samples is due to uniform dispersion of GNP/CNT in the PEEK matrix (see, Fig. 4b andc) which enables efficient stress transfer between the GNP/CNT and PEEK and the improved bead-bead interfacial strength. The vertically fabricated samples do not show significant improvement with GNP/CNT incorporation because the load (in bending mode) in this sample is parallel to multiple weak interfaces between beads. For all the samples, the storage modulus shows a sharp drop at a temperature of 150 � C which indicates the T g . No significant changes in T g of both horizontally and vertically fabricated samples are noticed, as seen from the storage modulus onset and peak of tan δ.DMA analysis for base and nano-reinforced PEEK composites were performed to examine the effect of nano-reinforcement and fabrication configuration on the thermomechanical properties of the PEEK nanocomposites.
