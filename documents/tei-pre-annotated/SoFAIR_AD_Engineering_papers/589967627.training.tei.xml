        <p>Therefore, a turnaround is required, entrusted to the design of new buildings with a reduced annual energy requirement, supported by the inclusion of systems powered by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The challenge, however, is not limited to new buildings. In fact, according to the EU Building Stock Observatory -the observatory that monitors the energy performance of buildings across the Member States -the building stock is inexorably aging, as confirmed by the alarming figures, composed of 75% buildings built before 1990 [1] with a renewal rate around 1.2% [2].Therefore, a turnaround is required, entrusted to the design of new buildings with a reduced annual energy requirement, supported by the inclusion of systems powered by Renewable Energy Sources (RES).

        <p>A probable, and already outlined, further step is represented by the possibility of connecting the individual NZEBs to an intelligent energy distribution network, also called smart grids. Positive Energy Buildings (PEBs) could be a new target, through their contribution to the energy support of other buildings connected to them, producing more energy than necessary to their needs. A system of units connected together at the neighbourhood level, aiming of achieving neutrality or, in extreme cases, energy positivity is the next challenge. The buildings will thus become collectors and energy storage structures.A probable, and already outlined, further step is represented by the possibility of connecting the individual NZEBs to an intelligent energy distribution network, also called smart grids.

        <p>The development of the work lies in outlining the tools and practical application of the indications of the European Union for the resolution of environmental problems, which involve air pollution, the depletion of natural resources and climate change. In order to mitigate these problems, the EU has offered several tools to its Member States: energy policies, observers, action programs to finance NZEB and PEB projects and research into promising materials and technologies.The development of the work lies in outlining the tools and practical application of the indications of the European Union for the resolution of environmental problems, which involve air pollution, the depletion of natural resources and climate change.

        <p>Energy consumption and production will be analyzed for a case study, represented by a building built with the utmost attention to energy aspects, located in areas outside densely populated urban centres.

        <p>The international regulatory situation allows stating that the continuous attention on building energy consumption [3] has led to the drafting of increasingly stringent laws, which aim at the energy efficiency of both new and existing buildings and at the reduction of polluting emissions. In fact, recently the premises of the EU Commission Recommendation on building renovation [4] reaffirms: "Buildings are central to the Union's energy efficiency policy as they account for nearly 40% of final energy consumption", of which 27% is attributable to the residential sector.The international regulatory situation allows stating that the continuous attention on building energy consumption [3] has led to the drafting of increasingly stringent laws, which aim at the energy efficiency of both new and existing buildings and at the reduction of polluting emissions.

        <p>A first indication about NZEB was introduced in the EU Directive in the year 2010 ( [5], art.2): "a building that has a very high energy performance, … The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby".A first indication about NZEB was introduced in the EU Directive in the year 2010 ( [5], art.2): "a building that has a very high energy performance, … The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby".</p>
        <p>The application of the NZEB model in Europe became mandatory starting from 31 December 2018 for new public buildings and it will be the same for all new buildings at the end of this year (31 December 2020) [5].The application of the NZEB model in Europe became mandatory starting from 31 December 2018 for new public buildings and it will be the same for all new buildings at the end of this year (31 December 2020) [5].</p>
        <p>Moreover, in order to achieve the Union's own targets for decarbonisation and energy efficiency in a costeffective manner, the non-ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) sectors -such as buildings and transport -must deliver on their potential. The goal is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050, as compared with 1990, to increase the proportion of used renewable energy [6].Moreover, in order to achieve the Union's own targets for decarbonisation and energy efficiency in a costeffective manner, the non-ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) sectors -such as buildings and transport -must deliver on their potential.

        <p>Finally, the most recent Directive (EU) 2018/844 [7], entered into force on 9 July 2018, amended the EPBD introducing (Art.2a) the target of NZEB also for existing buildings in the long-term renovation strategies. These strategies are implemented through the use of building automation and control technologies, as well as the introduction of smart grids for energy sharing.Finally, the most recent Directive (EU) 2018/844 [7], entered into force on 9 July 2018, amended the EPBD introducing (Art.2a) the target of NZEB also for existing buildings in the long-term renovation strategies.

        <p>The NZEB model, already applied for new buildings in several European Countries, is representing the target for the energy performance improvement also for the renovation of existing buildings, even if it is possible only for a part of the building stock, depending on a cost optimal analysis. Despite this, there is another model that could be considered, by overtaking the NZEB target towards the so called Positive (or Plus) Energy Building (PEB). This one can be considered different from a net-ZEB that in some periods produces excess energy that uses in other times, because the PEB should produce excess energy all over the year.The NZEB model, already applied for new buildings in several European Countries, is representing the target for the energy performance improvement also for the renovation of existing buildings, even if it is possible only for a part of the building stock, depending on a cost optimal analysis.

        <p>Therefore, the PEB model could be considered as a mean to make zero-energy-consumption one building and contemporarily to cover, even partially, the needs of some other existing buildings, leading perhaps to reach the energy independence of whole building stocks, when the mix of existing buildings and PEB can balance the energy needs. Several studies are already developed on this building model, and its potentialities (ref. 4.2 par.), even if a common definition and features have not yet been indicated.Therefore, the PEB model could be considered as a mean to make zero-energy-consumption one building and contemporarily to cover, even partially, the needs of some other existing buildings, leading perhaps to reach the energy independence of whole building stocks, when the mix of existing buildings and PEB can balance the energy needs.

        <p>In the following parts, a review of several examples of the development of the NZEB model in Europe is synthetized, also referring to EU projects on NZEB pilot cases. Finally, the near future on PEB is outlined: by means an overview on the main objectives and expected results of some EU projects. Furthermore, an example of a particular NZEB is described and some energy consumption data are discussed. This building, designed before EU indications on NZEB, falls within the current requirements for NZEB and could be adequate to be considered as a PEB. This project demonstrates that a smart integrated approach between building envelope and systems, right from the design phase, allows to obtain results that can go well beyond a NZEB.In the following parts, a review of several examples of the development of the NZEB model in Europe is synthetized, also referring to EU projects on NZEB pilot cases.

        <p>The European Construction Sector Observatory (ECSO) [9] worked in this direction, presenting in November 2018 analyses, statistics and comparative assessments between the 28 EU countries, with the aim of raising awareness among policy makers and stakeholders about market conditions, staff skills and energy efficiency.The European Construction Sector Observatory (ECSO) [9] worked in this direction, presenting in November 2018 analyses, statistics and comparative assessments between the 28 EU countries, with the aim of raising awareness among policy makers and stakeholders about market conditions, staff skills and energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>The economic recession caused by the debt crisis in Europe has affected many southern European countries (e.g. Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria), immediately leading to cuts in national budgets and thus affecting the share of GDP dedicated to public and private investments in the construction sector.The economic recession caused by the debt crisis in Europe has affected many southern European countries (e.g. Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria), immediately leading to cuts in national budgets and thus affecting the share of GDP dedicated to public and private investments in the construction sector.</p>
        <p>The slow economic recovery has been facilitated by the disbursement of national and EU funds in the 2014-2020 programming period and by the implementation of around 120 smart specialization strategies, which involve aid of over 60 billion euros, promoting the competitiveness and interregional cooperation [9].The slow economic recovery has been facilitated by the disbursement of national and EU funds in the 2014-2020 programming period and by the implementation of around 120 smart specialization strategies, which involve aid of over 60 billion euros, promoting the competitiveness and interregional cooperation [9].</p>
        <p>Another aspect that struck the attention of ECSO are the conditions of human capital in the construction sector [10]. Energy efficiency and sustainable construction will offer significant market potential, as only the renewable energy sector is expected to employ up to 2 million people by 2020, with most new jobs created in the energy sector. Therefore, an increase in the level of education, specialization of staff and skills in the field of energy efficiency must be initiated.Another aspect that struck the attention of ECSO are the conditions of human capital in the construction sector [10].

        <p>It is known that EU policies aim at encouraging Member States (MS) to reduce the energy consumption of their national building stock and to stimulate their conversion from energy consumers to energy producers through retrofit measures and integration of renewable energy sources [1]. This transition is made possible by improving resource efficiency, environmental performance and commercial opportunities. In fact, buildings are goods with a long life and a natural tendency to low replacement and renovation rates. At the current rate of renovation (around 1% per year depending on each MS), it will take more than 100 years to renovate the EU building stock [11]. Therefore, in addition to the new construction of NZEBs, it will be necessary to focus above all on the redevelopment of the existing one.It is known that EU policies aim at encouraging Member States (MS) to reduce the energy consumption of their national building stock and to stimulate their conversion from energy consumers to energy producers through retrofit measures and integration of renewable energy sources [1].

        <p>Finally, the good news is that there is a positive change of trends in building energy performance: new buildings today consume only half of the typical buildings of the 1980s. This was facilitated by the introduction of the EPBD and subsequent transpositions into national codes, which allowed consumers to make informed choices to save energy and money.Finally, the good news is that there is a positive change of trends in building energy performance: new buildings today consume only half of the typical buildings of the 1980s.

        <p>On the other side, Phase Change Materials (PCMs) represent one of the passive technological solutions that has already been extensively studied. They allow to store the energy supply of solar radiation, when located in the external layers of walls. In the form of mixtures of salts or paraffins, they are able to retain thermal energy under form of latent heat, to pass it successively in correspondence with a phase change (from solid to liquid and vice versa), in a temperature range compatible with human comfort (between 20°C and 30°C).On the other side, Phase Change Materials (PCMs) represent one of the passive technological solutions that has already been extensively studied.

        <p>The integration of these materials in the building envelope involves a series of advantages, including the reduction and the phase shift of the summer and winter thermal load peaks, the reduction of energy requirements (thanks to the use of more dynamic energy), and the potential improvement of the thermal comfort of the environment.The integration of these materials in the building envelope involves a series of advantages, including the reduction and the phase shift of the summer and winter thermal load peaks, the reduction of energy requirements (thanks to the use of more dynamic energy), and the potential improvement of the thermal comfort of the environment.</p>
        <p>For the above-mentioned advantages, researchers have extensively studied a new approach to develop a building envelope with high energy efficiency by increasing the ability of latent heat storage of the buildings through the macro-encapsulation technique [26]. This method improves the internal thermal behaviour of buildings and it has various advantages: high strength, durability, and thermal stability, and prevention of PCM losses during phase transformation. To prevent losses, maintain the density of thermal energy storage and increase the thermal conductivity of PCM through the use of porous materials based on carbon as support materials; a research was carried out on an aerosol based on porous carbon [27].For the above-mentioned advantages, researchers have extensively studied a new approach to develop a building envelope with high energy efficiency by increasing the ability of latent heat storage of the buildings through the macro-encapsulation technique [26].

        <p>The application of PCMs is quite wide, ranging from building materials (brick, plaster, concrete) to opaque and transparent components up to systems. Despite the advantages and applied research set out, PCMs would need further research to find solutions to still open problems, including the high cost of encapsulation production, the possible variation of thermal storage capacity after several cycles of use and the absence of real and practical reliable results.The application of PCMs is quite wide, ranging from building materials (brick, plaster, concrete) to opaque and transparent components up to systems.

        <p>Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIP) have been recently considered, thanks to their ability to improve the thermal performance of buildings with reduced thickness. Together with aerogel, VIP belongs to the promising family of Super-Insulation Materials (SIM). The thermal insulation is obtained by means of a gas-tight enclosure surrounding a rigid core, from which the air has been evacuated. Thanks to their high thermal resistance, VIPs would allow to reach ZEB standards with a reduced thickness when compared with traditional insulation (rock wool or EPS) and are declared to reach a thermal transmittance of 0.18 W/(m 2 •K) [30]. Their application in buildings energy retrofit could be interesting. In fact, if an internal insulation is used -preferable in the case of historic or listed buildings -a larger usable floor area is saved, compared to the installation of traditional insulators, resulting in an economic advantage for the building owner [31].Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIP) have been recently considered, thanks to their ability to improve the thermal performance of buildings with reduced thickness.

        <p>Renewable Energy Systems (RES) are decisive to achieving NZEB goals. The European directive 2018/844 encourages Member States to increase the share of energy consumption from renewable sources, depending on the territorial and climatic conditions. Renewable energies on site, such as solar thermal and photovoltaic systems, are more convenient in Mediterranean climates (e.g. Spain, Italy, Greece) characterized by greater solar radiation. Biomass products used in heating systems and heat pumps (geothermal energy) are particularly common in cold climate countries in northern Europe (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Latvia). A study [37], in 12 European capitals, demonstrated the importance of the role played by renewable energy sources in reaching the nZEB target. Compared to the basic building, the NZEB configuration, optimized by the combination of insulation, air tightness, class A++ appliances, and home energy management systems together with photovoltaics, is characterized by 90% energy savings.Renewable Energy Systems (RES) are decisive to achieving NZEB goals.

        <p>Before some notes on the PEB model and its application at the district level, a brief discussion focuses on the dual energy role that a PEB is able to play. In recent decades there has been a progressive evolution of the energy market. The traditional production-consumption model, operating according to a static distribution system (Distribution Network Operator -DNO) and focused on the supply of one-way electricity, threatens to be replaced by a more fluid distribution system: the Distribution System Operator (DSO), based on more active and decentralized energy management. This is made possible by the introduction of innovative technologies: production of energy from renewable sources, data management systems, smart grids and energy storage systems.Before some notes on the PEB model and its application at the district level, a brief discussion focuses on the dual energy role that a PEB is able to play.

        <p>It should be noted that in the summer period they can be superimposed, thus highlighting that the estimates made in the design phase reflect the actual energy behaviour of the building. Starting from year 2017, in summer, a peak is shown, due to the heat pump use for the dehumidification, depending on a different setpoint adopted on cooling water. This effect is not visible in 2018 summer period because of a temporary failure. In winter the two trends show significant differences, with measured values lower than expected. This is probably due to the careful management of the systems: the adoption of a positive offset of 3°C of the internal temperature during the sunshine hours involves forcing the operation of the heat pump for air conditioning during photovoltaic self-production hours, in order to reduce the consumption of electricity from the network during the night. The comparison between the production of electric energy from the photovoltaic (PV) system and the consumption of total electricity taken from the network in the real case (Figure 5) shows that the electrical coverage from photovoltaics is guaranteed for almost the whole year, however in winter it is necessary to use electricity from the grid. All the not used energy, mostly from February to November, is transferred to the grid.It should be noted that in the summer period they can be superimposed, thus highlighting that the estimates made in the design phase reflect the actual energy behaviour of the building.

        <p>The comparison between the overall share of electricity consumed and that produced by the photovoltaic system shows that the building uses only 34% of the energy available from photovoltaics to satisfy user's needs. Therefore, the energy surplus is sold to the urban grid, with a consequent much higher economic return compared to the small expenses during the winter months, in which the solar radiation exploitation is not sufficient to cover energy consumption.The comparison between the overall share of electricity consumed and that produced by the photovoltaic system shows that the building uses only 34% of the energy available from photovoltaics to satisfy user's needs.

        <p>In particular, the last year of data collection of energy consumption and production (data from January 2019 to December 2019) has been analyzed. For this period, the maximum production of electricity by the photovoltaic system was recorded, equal to 2100 kWhe. In addition, for the winter months of January and February, consumption was lower than the energy generated by photovoltaics, while for the months of November and December, higher consumption was recorded, probably attributable to reduced solar radiation and a greater energy demand for indoor heating service. The most recent calculations have led to show that the building uses only 37% of the energy produced by the photovoltaic system for self-consumption. The remaining share of renewable energy is destined for sale in the urban network, with peaks of up to 1890 kWhe, recorded in the summer months.In particular, the last year of data collection of energy consumption and production (data from January 2019 to December 2019) has been analyzed.

Therefore, the construction sector must also necessarily align itself with the objectives set by the EU.

        <p>The study shows that, with a careful design and sizing of the building envelope and the plant system, it can be realised a production of electricity from renewable sources much higher than the energy that the building would need for self-consumption. This energy surplus demonstrates the PEB potential of the building. The results may allow to support the development of a roadmap for a greater diffusion of the PEB in the territory and to encourage the creation of energy independent districts.The study shows that, with a careful design and sizing of the building envelope and the plant system, it can be realised a production of electricity from renewable sources much higher than the energy that the building would need for self-consumption.
