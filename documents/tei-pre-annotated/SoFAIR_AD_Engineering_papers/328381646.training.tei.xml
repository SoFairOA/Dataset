        <p>To solve the present energy crisis and pollution problems, wave energy can play an important role because of its energy density and availability. To harness energy from ocean waves there are many research works proceeding all over the world. Research on wave energy technology started informally in the 1940s by Yoshio Masuda, a Japanese marine captain, who invented a navigation buoy based air turbine PTO system which was later named as the (floating) oscillating-water-column (OWC) (Antonio, 2010;Falcão and Henriques, 2016). Academically the research started in the 1970s when the fossil oil price increased and the Middle East restricted oil supply (Polinder and Scuotto, 2005). By the 1980s, the wave energy research slowly stopped because the price of oil again reduced and the necessary funds to continue research in this field was not available. Some researchers from Europe, especially from UK and Norway did the majority of the early work and during this time the researchers mostly focused on hydrodynamic systems and developed the point absorber type of wave energy converters and the oscillating water column type of device concepts and the fundamental theoretical understanding of ocean wave energy (Elwood et al., 2010;McArthur and Brekken, 2010). It was then several decades before the research of wave energy started again, driven by increasing energy demand, the price of conventional energy, and pollution and climate change concerns. Therefore, the academic research into ocean wave energy can be divided into two phases as in the late 1970s and at present. Up to date there are many wave energy converters (WEC) that have been developed and deployed in different countries and several hundred WEC projects around the world are still at various stages of developments. This number is continuously increasing as new concepts and technologies are developed. Day et al (Day et al., 2015) summarised that since 2015, worldwide there are more than a hundred projects and more than one thousand patents that have been developed in Europe, USA, Japan, China and Asia.To solve the present energy crisis and pollution problems, wave energy can play an important role because of its energy density and availability.

        <p>Different concepts, techniques, designs and working principles have been investigated using the WEC to harness energy from the ocean waves, therefore the classification of WEC depends on different aspects. Wave energy systems can be classified by different methods such as according to location, structure, working or operational principle, size and orientation, and power take-off systems (Antonio, 2010;Czech and Bauer, 2012;Falnes, 2007;Hong et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2018). The most well-known diagram of the WEC classification was presented by Falcão et al (Antonio, 2010). Based on installation location, the WECs can be classified by three types: (1) Onshore devices which are usually designed to be installed at or to the shoreline; (2) Offshore devices that are installed in deep water (&gt;40 m); (3) Near shore devices which are deployed in shallow water regions (water at depths less than 20m).Different concepts, techniques, designs and working principles have been investigated using the WEC to harness energy from the ocean waves, therefore the classification of WEC depends on different aspects.

        <p>Power take off (PTO) systems are at the heart of wave energy converters (WEC) and many academic researchers from several universities and many wave energy technology developer companies are actively working to develop and improve the PTO system (Babarit, 2013;Babarit and Clément, 2006;Babarit et al., 2009;Clément and Babarit, 2012;Cretel et al., 2011;Folley et al., 2012;Folley and Whittaker, 2009;Fusco and Ringwood, 2012;Hals et al., 2002;Saulnier et al., 2011). So far there are many concepts that have been used in PTO systems to harness maximum energy with low installation and maintenance costs, as can be seen in Figure 1. Previously published review articles have focused either on the challenges, current status, and development of WECs or classifications based on working principles and generators, with a brief discussion on the various parts of the WEC and energy harvesting systems. However, there does not appear to have been a single article that presents the review of WECs based on the power take off (PTO) system. It is known that the economic viability, efficiency and complexity of the structure of the WEC depends on its power take off (PTO) system. Therefore, with the aim to find the success of research, advancement and deployment of power take-off (PTO) systems of the WEC, a comprehensive study is required where all past and present works are reviewed. It is anticipated that this present review work can offer novel insights into the range of PTO systems that are being used for WECs with the intention of encouraging new research activity in the wave energy field.Power take off (PTO) systems are at the heart of wave energy converters (WEC) and many academic researchers from several universities and many wave energy technology developer companies are actively working to develop and improve the PTO system (Babarit, 2013;Babarit and Clément, 2006;Babarit et al., 2009;Clément and Babarit, 2012;Cretel et al., 2011;Folley et al., 2012;Folley and Whittaker, 2009;Fusco and Ringwood, 2012;Hals et al., 2002;Saulnier et al., 2011).

        <p>Hydraulic motor-based PTO systems are one of the well-known methods which can be used for wave energy conversion in WECs to convert the low-speed oscillating motion into energy (Drew et al., 2009). The hydraulic motor-based PTO system is the most suitable device for generating usable electricity from wave energy, particularly for the wave-activated-bodies wave energy conversion system. Thus, the hydraulic motor can utilize both translation and rotational types of wave energy conversion systems (Jusoh et al., 2019). Jose F. Gaspar et al (Gaspar et al., 2016) summarized the mathematical and numerical models of the hydraulic PTO concept which can be implemented for different types of WECs with reliable, standardized and scalable technology.Hydraulic motor-based PTO systems are one of the well-known methods which can be used for wave energy conversion in WECs to convert the low-speed oscillating motion into energy (Drew et al., 2009).

        <p>Hydraulic types of PTO systems generally consist of a hydraulic cylinder or ram, hydraulic motor, accumulator and generator. The schematic diagram of a typical hydraulic motor type PTO system is shown in Figure 2. Normally the ocean waves drive the hydraulic ram to increase the pressure of a working medium, (usually hydraulic oil) meaning that the hydraulic cylinder of the PTO system converts the translation or rotational motion into hydraulic energy which runs the hydraulic motor. The hydraulic motor then drives the generator to generate energy (Drew et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2012). The working principle of the hydraulic systems have been described in (Gaspar et al., 2016;Henderson, 2006;Lasa et al., 2012). The control of the PTO force is also the major factor to increase the efficiency of the WEC and there are many control systems such as Declutching control and Latching control that have been proposed by researchers (Babarit et al., 2009;Xie and Zuo, 2013). The characteristics of hydraulic PTO systems are very favourable for WEC therefore there are many WECs that have been proposed and designed using this approach (Blake and Chaplin, 1998;Henderson, 2006;Salter, 1979). For increasing the efficiency of the WECs there are many research works that have been done to improve the designs of the hydraulic pump or motor and control systems (Budal and Falnes, 1977;Eidsmoen, 1998;Falcão, 2000;French, 1979;Heath et al., 2000;Salter and Rampen, 1993).Hydraulic types of PTO systems generally consist of a hydraulic cylinder or ram, hydraulic motor, accumulator and generator.

The Scottish Pelamis Wave Power</p>
        <p>Company developed the Pelamis WEC and installed it in offshore from Orkney, Scotland for harnessing 750 kW of power by using the surface wave motion (Hagerman, 2004). The working method of the Pelamis has been discussed in Ref. (Hagerman, 2004). AW-Energy Ltd developed a series of Wave Rollers and deployed them in Portugal for testing the performances during two different years, 2007 and 2012 (Lin et al., 2015b;Lucas et al., 2012), as shown in Figure 3. The rated power of these two devices were 100 and 300 kW, respectively. Professor Salter at the University of Edinburgh proposed a WEC in 1974 which was known as the Duck (Salter, 1974). The Duck as shown in Figure 4 has been designed in such a way that the buoy travels with a pitching movement around the shaft to create hydrodynamic pressure instead of up-and-down movement. The working principle of the Duck can be seen in Ref. (Clément et al., 2002). In 2013 a Duck wave energy conversion system was developed by using many multilevel models of hydraulic systems and were tested by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion in China, having a power generation capacity of 100 kW (Lin et al., 2015b).

        <p>Because of the large power density of the waves and being suitable for low-frequency operation, the hydraulic motor-based PTO system has significant advantages (Gaspar et al., 2016). The hydraulic motor can generate large amounts of power from the low frequency waves and can be used effectively to extract energy from the continuous variation of the wave energy converter movement. Generally, waves create large forces with slow speed and in these conditions the hydraulic system is very suitable and effective to harvest energy (Drew et al., 2009;Henderson, 2006;Zhang et al., 2012). The hydraulic motor system usually uses incompressible fluid which can help to deliver higher efficiency. The overall claimed efficiency of the system varied from 69% to 80% but in the real-world it would have a lower efficiency (Hansen et al., 2013b). In addition, with the aim of maximising energy absorption along with the ocean wave condition the hydraulic motor system can also be used to control the WEC device (António, 2007). The components needed to assemble the hydraulic motor system are locally available from hydraulic components suppliers (Lasa et al., 2012).Because of the large power density of the waves and being suitable for low-frequency operation, the hydraulic motor-based PTO system has significant advantages (Gaspar et al., 2016).

The hydraulic motor-based PTO system consists of a lot of mechanical moving parts therefore its structure is complex and it needs regular system maintenance in ocean environment which is costly, risky and time consuming (Drew et al., 2009). Moreover, another challenge of the hydraulic motor-based PTO system is the end-stop problem. The hydraulic actuator can exceed its maximum displacement limit and can damage the system due to unexpected extreme conditions (Jusoh et al., 2019).The fluid flows inside the hydraulic system due to compression and decompression of the fluid in the hydraulic actuator chamber and this can create hydraulic oil leakage (Zou and Abdelkhalik, 2018), which can harm the marine environment.

        <p>The advantage of using air as the working fluid for WEC is to increase the wave's slow velocities into high air flow rates. The pneumatic air turbine transfer system does not have environmental impact like the hydraulic motor-based PTO systems, as the air turbine is used to harness energy from the high air flow, which has been a mature technology for many decades. The benefits of the air turbines are that they can be located away from the potentially corrosive salt water and destructive high waves, not being in direct contact with them; they can also be located to be easily accessible for maintenance (Soares et al., 2012). However, conventional turbines are not suitable because of the bidirectional flow. Non-return valves coupled with a traditional turbine are a possible solution to this problem, but the non-return valve airflow rectification system is complicated and hard to maintain. In fact, in a large-scale wave energy unit, such a system cannot be implemented because the valve is large (Maria-Arenas et al., 2019;Pecher and Kofoed, 2017). Due to its ability to rotate in the same direction, regardless of airflow direction, the Wells turbine is the most popular pneumatic air turbine transfer system design. The major disadvantage of the Wells turbine is that it is not self-starting:The advantage of using air as the working fluid for WEC is to increase the wave's slow velocities into high air flow rates. The pneumatic air turbine transfer system does not have environmental impact like the hydraulic motor-based PTO systems, as the air turbine is used to harness energy from the high air flow, which has been a mature technology for many decades. The benefits of the air turbines are that they can be located away from the potentially corrosive salt water and destructive high waves, not being in direct contact with them; they can also be located to be easily accessible for maintenance (Soares et al., 2012). However, conventional turbines are not suitable because of the bidirectional flow.

It requires low maintenance and can operate with 90 % efficiency (Pecher and Kofoed, 2017). For wave energy conversion, the bottleneck lies in the extraction of energy from ocean waves that can provide enough head and flow to be economical for the Kaplan turbine generator unit. The significant benefit of using the hydro turbine is that no environmental problems are caused by fluid leakage (Drew et al., 2009). The drawback is that ocean water is a dynamic fluid with various unpredictable components.

        <p>Therefore, the Direct Mechanical Drive wave energy conversion system obtains more wave energy than hydraulic system because of the reduced friction. Numerous traditional transmission mechanisms have been proposed for use in wave energy converters, such as rack and pinion, belt drive system, ratchet wheel or screw mechanisms.

        <p>To overcome the mechanical complexity of some of the WEC designs, electromagnetic based linear generators or direct electrical drive systems have been used in PTO systems (Mueller and Baker, 2002;Polinder et al., 2005). The concept of the linear generator, when placed on the seabed, is based on the use of a translator and stator, where the translator is attached to a floating buoy and the stator is fixed or vice versa. The translator consists of permanent magnets, and the stator is equipped with coil windings. The translator moves up and down along with the buoy because of the hydrodynamic action of the ocean waves and creates the magnetic field inside the coil windings, thereby creating the electric power.

        <p>The word "Direct electrical Drive" indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy directly without any pneumatics or complex linear-to-rotary conversion systems. This device directly couples the mechanical energy collected by the primary converter to the moving part of a linear generator (Baker and Mueller, 2001;Mueller, 2002). That means this system has the advantage of not requiring an intermediate mechanical interface (for example a gearbox) and thus avoids the losses that take place in other PTO systems (turbines and hydraulic motors) which consequently reduces maintenance cost (Hong et al., 2014;Leijon et al., 2008;Muetze and Vining, 2006). The main advantages of direct electric drive systems (linear permanent magnet generators) are a relatively high efficiency and the possibility of continuous force control (Danielsson, 2006). In addition, this PTO system needs power electronics in order to convert the generated electricity to a form that is suitable for the electric grid (Hong et al., 2014). The main disadvantage of linear generators is that the linear velocity of the translator, determined by the velocity of the absorber, is much lower than conventional rotary generators' equivalent rotational velocity due to low frequencies of the ocean waves. Other drawbacks are the low power-to-weight ratio (very large machines are needed) and the need for a heavy structure due to the attractive forces between the stator and the translator (Penalba and Ringwood, 2016). Moreover, the power transmission system is very complicated due to the unequal generated voltage created by the irregular wave motion (Leijon et al., 2008).The word "Direct electrical Drive" indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy directly without any pneumatics or complex linear-to-rotary conversion systems.

The hybrid system is a very recent research topic in the field of wave energy and wind energy research and only a limited number of articles have been published (Fusco et al., 2010;Veigas et al., 2014a;Veigas andIglesias, 2013, 2015;Veigas et al., 2014b).

        <p>Carlos Perez-Collazo et al (Perez-Collazo et al., 2018) proposed a hybrid system for jacketframe offshore wind substructures. The proposed hybrid system combines an oscillating water column (OWC) type WEC with jacket-frame offshore wind substructures. Generally, the hybrid systems currently being proposed (research and development levels) are based on fixed (mooring) and floating structure (Kim et al., 2015). There are a couple of hybrid wave-wind systems that have been proposed in some countries. Green Ocean energy, a marine energy company based in Scotland, is developing a wave-wind energy device known as Wave Tender (as shown in Figure 18) and currently, it is projected to have a peak rating of 500kW to 700kW due to high yield per unit of sea area (Technology, 2019b). The system consists of wind turbines to generate energy from the air in the top of the ocean surface and hydraulic cylinders to convert wave energy. A Poseidon system demonstrator has been constructed by the Danish company Floating Power Plant in which a range of pitching type WECs are mounted on a secure crosstype base (Ding et al., 2015). Moreover, a Norwegian company is developing a W2power system that incorporates a point-absorber type WEC and two wind turbines (Ding et al., 2015).Carlos Perez-Collazo et al (Perez-Collazo et al., 2018) proposed a hybrid system for jacketframe offshore wind substructures.

        <p>The main advantage of the hybrid system is its cost saving structure because two working principles to harvest energy can couple with one structure which will reduce the installation and mooring cost. For example, the Hybrid system combining either a floating or mooring wind turbine with wave energy converters in order to harvest energy from the offshore area will reduce the initial investments required compared to the two independent systems. By using the hybrid concept, the new or existing wind turbine infrastructure could be developed as a hybrid system (Manasseh et al., 2017). Therefore, the overall cost of installation, operation and maintenance can be decreased. Moreover, the wave energy converters (WECs) should be incorporated into the platform's overall motion response, thus having a stabilising effect on the entire device (Ding et al., 2015). The hybrid system can deliver higher power efficiency and it have a smoother integration into the grid network, by being less influenced by a single resource's variability (Rusu and Onea, 2018). In addition, by sharing the grid connection, logistics, and the same infrastructure, offshore wind farms could reduce the energy cost of the wave energy. However, because of the one working principle the other working system's performances could be changed because of the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings. Such as, if the wave energy converter couples with the floating wind turbine then due to the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings between the floating bodies, the behaviour of the floating wind turbine would be changed (Ding et al., 2015). Therefore, the efficiency of the floating wind turbine could be reduced. Moreover, the two working systems will increase the loads on the structure. Coupling a wave energy converter with a floating wind turbine will also increase the loads of the substructure (Perez-Collazo et al., 2018).The main advantage of the hybrid system is its cost saving structure because two working principles to harvest energy can couple with one structure which will reduce the installation and mooring cost.

        <p>The piezoelectric energy harvesting system's energy density is three times higher than the electromagnetic energy harvesting system, and it occupies smaller space than turbine transductions (Nabavi et al., 2018;Priya, 2007). The piezoelectric material based ocean wave energy device, being smaller and lighter, can generate energy from low-frequency wave range in a variety of water motions (Hwang et al., 2017;Su et al., 2014). Moreover, the piezoelectric materials can be easily integrated into the device, having no moving parts, and therefore do not require frequent maintenance (Jbaily and Yeung, 2015). The disadvantages of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system are that the systems are mostly complex, costly, and work well only with shallow ocean waves (Viet et al., 2016). The energy efficiency is also very low compared to electromagnetic and triboelectric nanogenerators because of the energy transduction principal. These methods often convert less than 10% of the available ocean energy into electricity (Wang, 2017).The piezoelectric energy harvesting system's energy density is three times higher than the electromagnetic energy harvesting system, and it occupies smaller space than turbine transductions (Nabavi et al., 2018;Priya, 2007).

        <p>The fabrication and installation costs of the EAP generator based WEC are low compared with other conventional WECs because the PTO system is also the structure of the device and it can be run until failure (Babarit et al., 2013a). This type of device can avoid the stress concentration and flexible due to the PTO system being distributed over the whole surface (Babarit et al., 2013a). Without moving mechanical parts this device can generate electricity directly from ocean waves (Wattez and van Kessel, 2016). It acts like an antenna which amplifies the dynamic pressure of the ocean waves and it has high number of degrees of freedom and therefore high number of resonance modes which helps to generate energy in any condition period of the waves in any frequency range (Andritsch et al., 2012;Jean et al., 2012). This device is still in the research and development phase and work continues to address the key challenges (Wattez and van Kessel, 2016). The key challenges of the EAP generator based WEC are that the system should be operated at field strengths above 50 V/µm to optimise the maximum energy because of the flexible nature of the system (Andritsch et al., 2012). The lifetime of the device is low compared to the conventional WECs due to the use of segmented electrodes (Jean et al., 2012). Moreover, this device can be destroyed in survival conditions and the fatigue life can be reduced as it operates under combined mechanical and electrical load cycles (Babarit et al., 2013a).The fabrication and installation costs of the EAP generator based WEC are low compared with other conventional WECs because the PTO system is also the structure of the device and it can be run until failure (Babarit et al., 2013a).

        <p>While a wide number of WECs have been designed over the last few decades, their concepts of extracting waves are identical. By using the PTO system, the absorbed energy is transformed into usable electricity. Therefore, the PTO system is very important in the WEC device because it not only directly affects how effectively the captured wave energy is converted into electricity, but also determines the WEC's mass, size and structural dynamics (Têtu, 2017).While a wide number of WECs have been designed over the last few decades, their concepts of extracting waves are identical.

        <p>The PTO system has direct effect on power conversion efficiency and the levelling cost of energy (LCOE) by providing this direct influence on the WEC. In addition, the PTO system directly impacts the capital cost of a project by usually accounting for between 20 to 30 % of the overall cost of capital (Bedard et al., 2004). The reliability of the PTO system also has effects on the energy production, operation and in the maintenance cost. Moreover, research has shown that proper PTO design has an effect on increasing the efficiency and reducing the LCOE of the WEC (Seanergy, 2016). However, unlike the wind energy market, there is no industry standard device for conversion of wave energy and this variety is transferred to the PTO system. There have been studies into many different types of PTO systems, and the type of PTO system used in a WEC is often associated with its size. For instance, the air turbinebased PTO system is normally used in oscillating water column devices and different types of PTO system can be used in point absorber-based devices and it depends on their configuration and may need cascaded conversion mechanisms (Têtu, 2017). There are five types of PTO systems usually used in WECs and among them, the hydraulic motor type PTO system is especially well-suited to absorb energy from high force, slow oscillatory motion and can enable the conversion of reciprocating motion to rotary motion to drive the generator. However, they have various design challenges including efficiency and reliability. The direct mechanical and direct electric drive-based PTO systems provide alternative options, but their technologies are less mature. However, while each PTO system has its advantages and disadvantages, the decisions on which type of PTO system is to be used in a particular WEC depends primarily on the method of capturing the wave power, wave condition, and cost etc. Currently, there is still no PTO system commercially developed and deployed and the design can still be considered to be in the early stages.

By reducing technological or nontechnological risks, this sector can also increase the confidence of the potential investors. By including engineers, environmental scientists, economists, lawyers, regulators and policy experts, this can be done via interdisciplinary methods.

        <p>There are numerous research and development (R&amp;D) project works ae going on all over the world focusing on future wave energy technologies and prototype developments. Some current research WEC projects have been listed in Table 8. In the last decade's research and development work of WEC, the numerical modelling has achieved the desired level of maturity to model multi-body interactions to the second order or higher accuracy, such as non-linear BEM, CFD (Stratigaki, 2019). A wide variety of models are presently available, ranging from the simplest ones which can simulate wave propagation and far-field effects to the more complex models that can deal with the actual interaction between the waves and the devices. More advanced models can also simulate the mooring system, the existence of articulated parts connected by hinges, springs and pulleys and their use will help properly investigate the behaviour of the PTO system. The models require a correct understanding of the governing physics to optimize the WEC's design phase and evaluate its survival, covering different time and space scales. , 2015). The code of the WEC-Sim has been created in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>/
            <rs type="software">SIMULINK</rs> by using the multi-body dynamics solver 
            <rs type="software">Simscape Multibody</rs> and the WEC-Sim could model devices that contain rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. The Waterpower Technologies Office from the U.S. Department of Energy provided funding for the WEC-Sim project and the effort for developing the code was a collaboration between the Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

        <p>However, compare with other renewable energy technologies, the costs of the wave energy technologies are too high, and this is one of the biggest challenges for commercializing WEC devices (Contestabile et al., 2017). To commercialize WEC devices in large scale there are a number of improvements that are required such as the important challenges of WEC PTO system reliability, maintenance, survivability, efficiency which need to be solved. Furthermore, losses in the energy-conversion chain should be decreased (Liang et al., 2017;Liu, 2016).However, compare with other renewable energy technologies, the costs of the wave energy technologies are too high, and this is one of the biggest challenges for commercializing WEC devices (Contestabile et al., 2017).

        <p>Ocean Energy Systems (OES) projected the Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) analyses, as shown in Figure 20, for wave energy in 2015 which showed that the cost should be reduced significantly by 2050(Seanergy, 2016)). Still the object of the wave energy technology roadmap initiated by OES is to achieve these LCOE targets (OES, 2018a). Moreover, it is hoped that the hybrid systems (combined wave and offshore wind energy) can further reduce the LCOE (Pérez-Collazo et al., 2015). If the wave energy converter devices are installed in the offshore wind turbine structure then the installation, foundation and mooring costs will be reduced. It is expected that developments in the future generation of wave energy technology could reduce the costs of power take-off (by 22%), installation (18%), operation and maintenance (17%), foundation and mooring (6%) and grid connection (5%) (IRENA, 2014).Ocean Energy Systems (OES) projected the Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) analyses, as shown in Figure 20, for wave energy in 2015 which showed that the cost should be reduced significantly by 2050(Seanergy, 2016)).

        <p>The size of the potential ocean energy market is huge. By 2050, it is projected that more than 300 GW of ocean energy installed capacity could have been deployed, capable of generating 68K direct jobs and saving 500 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (OES, 2020b). The ocean energy industry is preparing to install 100 GW of production capacity in Europe alone by 2050, meeting 10 percent of demand for electricity which would be enough to meet the daily needs of 76 million households, creating 40K skilled jobs in Europe (Europe, 2020c). European companies are today the strong global leaders in ocean energy, accounting for 66 percent of tidal energy patents and 44 percent of wave energy patents worldwide (Europe, 2020b). By using the European technology, significant projects have been developed outside Europe in Canada and South-East Asia. Therefore, EU companies are in a strong position to lead the global market as seen in the analysis in Table 9. However, most of the wave energy technologies are still at an early stage and only a few companies have been able to test their devices in the open sea (Lasa et al., 2012). It can be seen from Table 9 that there are numerous developer companies actively working around the world.

        <p>As studied in this paper, wave energy technologies are currently undergoing innovative research and development all over the world. Due to the significant potential of the future ocean energy resources, the improvement and progress of wave energy technologies continues to This paper has presented a brief review of the advances in power take-off systems for wave energy technologies. The novel analysis has shown that power take off systems can be classified into their five major groupings of direct mechanical drive, hydro and air turbine transfer system, hydraulic motor system, direct electrical drive system, along with other triboelectric nanogenerators. The hydraulic motor, turbine transfer and direct mechanical drive systems are the most popular used PTO systems in the prototype WEC because of technology maturity and their effective working ability. So far, most of the prototype WECs have been deployed in offshore locations because of the higher wave power density and the onshore land installation issues. The analysis of the major advances and challenges of these systems has also been provided.As studied in this paper, wave energy technologies are currently undergoing innovative research and development all over the world.
