        <p>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is an elastomeric polymer with interesting properties for biomedical applications, including physiological indifference, excellent resistance to biodegradation, biocompatibility, chemical stability, gas permeability, good mechanical properties, excellent optical transparency and simple fabrication by replica moulding [1][2][3][4][5]. Due to these characteristics, PDMS has been widely used in micropumps [6], catheter surfaces [7], dressings and bandages [8], microvalves [9], optical systems [10,11], in the in vitro study of diseases [12,13], in implants [14,15], in microfluidics and photonics [16][17][18][19]. Moreover, soft-lithography technology has driven the use of PDMS in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications and in microfluidic components [17,18,20]. Soft-lithography techniques such as micro-contact printing, replica moulding, micro-transfer moulding, micro-moulding in capillaries and solvent-assisted micro-moulding usually require the use of PDMS to create an elastomeric stamp or mould that incorporates nano-and microstructures for the transfer of patterns onto a subsequent substrate [18,21].Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is an elastomeric polymer with interesting properties for biomedical applications, including physiological indifference, excellent resistance to biodegradation, biocompatibility, chemical stability, gas permeability, good mechanical properties, excellent optical transparency and simple fabrication by replica moulding [1][2][3][4][5].

        <p>The investigation and improvement of already existing MEMS are more and more common. As they are increasingly commercialized, the necessity to find processes and materials that enable mass production while reducing cost has emerged [21]. MEMS are traditionally silicon-based and the pursuit for a more biologically friendly material is needed. Polymers allow rapid prototyping and mass production techniques as well as having a lower cost in relation to silicon, making them particularly attractive for the development of MEMS [21]. Photolithography is the most commonly used technique in microfabrication, however, this method is expensive [24]. With the introduction of polymers in microsystems, new manufacturing techniques have been studied, such as soft-lithography, which can be a cheaper method comparatively to photolithography, even when a costly mould is needed for patterning; once a mould is created, it can be reused several times [20]. Additionally, there are alternatives which are attempting to reduce the cost of the moulds, relying on cleanroom less approaches [25]. Candidate polymers for the production of MEMS are polycarbonate (PC), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and PDMS [21].The investigation and improvement of already existing MEMS are more and more common.

        <p>In addition to applications in microfluidics, PDMS has been widely used in the fabrication of biomodels (flow phantom) for the in vitro hemodynamic study of diseases such as aneurysms and stenosis [28][29][30][31]. The biomodels developed in PDMS allow good replicability of the lumen of the arteries and good transparency, being ideal for the application of optical techniques of micro particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and non-evasive techniques [32][33][34]. These experimental tests have provided a greater understanding of these pathologies, validated numerical techniques and tested medical devices such as stents [35][36][37].In addition to applications in microfluidics, PDMS has been widely used in the fabrication of biomodels (flow phantom) for the in vitro hemodynamic study of diseases such as aneurysms and stenosis [28][29][30][31].

        <p>PDMS has also been investigated in the field of medical implants [38][39][40][41][42]. These types of implants are usually made with titanium or its alloys; however, such materials do not allow a good osseointegration [39]. In order to overcome this limitation, PDMS has been studied to produce coatings with microscale features that help the bonding between the implant and the bone. The main characteristics for its use in implants are its high biocompatibility, excellent resistance to biodegradation and flexibility, which makes PDMS one of the most successful polymers in implanted devices, presenting only mild foreign body reactions [43][44][45]. Common applications include cardiac pacemakers, cuff and book electrodes in the PNS, cochlear implants, bladder and pain controllers and planar electrode arrays in the CNS [45,46].PDMS has also been investigated in the field of medical implants [38][39][40][41][42].

        <p>Silicon, glass and polymers are the typical materials used for micro devices fabrication: silicon, because of its thermal conductivity and the availability of advanced fabrication technologies; glass, mainly due to its transparency; polymers, because of its low cost, optical transparency and flexibility. Compared to glass and silicon, PDMS turns out to be the most promising elastomer, because the other two materials have a high manufacturing cost, require greater labour intensity and are rigid in nature. The variable elasticity of PDMS in medical applications is also favourable; its modulus of elasticity is 1-3 MPa (compared to ~50 GPa of glass) [2,47]. PDMS is also chemically inert, thermally stable, permeable to gases, simple to handle and manipulate, exhibits isotropic and homogeneous properties and can replicate submicron features to develop microstructures [19,21,48]. Additionally, this elastomer is optically transparent, can work as a thermal and electrical insulator and degrades quickly in the natural environment [49]. PDMS presents a hyperelastic behaviour, which is the ability of a material to undergo large deformations before rupture [50]. This characteristic is also found in biological tissues and, for that reason, PDMS is a well-suited material to mimic, for example, blood vessels [49]. Another characteristic of this elastomer is its biocompatibility, which means that PDMS is compatible with biologic tissues [49]. PDMS presents a transmittance up to 90% for the wavelength from 390 nm to 780 nm [51][52][53] and, due to this characteristic, PDMS-based microsystems allow the direct observation of the mimicked blood flow inside the mimicked vessels and the integration of optical detection systems, hence playing an important role in this field.Silicon, glass and polymers are the typical materials used for micro devices fabrication: silicon, because of its thermal conductivity and the availability of advanced fabrication technologies; glass, mainly due to its transparency; polymers, because of its low cost, optical transparency and flexibility.

        <p>With the purpose of extending the lifespan of a chip, PDMS is used to embed or encapsulate electronic components by casting. Due to its thermal and electrical insulation capability, PDMS protects the components from environmental factors and mechanical shock within a large temperature range (-50-200 • C) [23,48]. In Table 1, some physical properties of PDMS are listed. -49.9 to -40 [63] Despite these advantages, PDMS has some properties that can present a limitation in some applications. Due to its CH 3 groups, PDMS presents a hydrophobic surface (contact angle with water ~108 • ± 7 • ) [62,64,65], often limiting its application in solutions composed of biological samples [66]. Additionally, PDMS tends to swell when combined with certain reagents [17,48]. In some applications, the absorption of small molecules flowing through the channels makes it difficult to quantitatively analyse experiments in proteomic drug discovery and cell culture [67,68]. In microchannels, the hydrophobicity of PDMS generates complications that include impedance to the flow of polar liquids, which makes it difficult to wet its surface with aqueous solvents [49]. On the other hand, much effort has been made to make the PDMS surface hydrophilic and resistant to protein adsorption [19,[69][70][71][72][73].With the purpose of extending the lifespan of a chip, PDMS is used to embed or encapsulate electronic components by casting.

        <p>Strategies employed in attempting to solve PDMS hydrophobicity include surface activation methods such as: oxygen plasma; UV/ozone treatments; corona discharges, which are widely used for PDMS surface oxidation to promote microchannel wettability. The main benefits of these methods are the short treatment time and easy operation; however, the PDMS surface recovers its hydrophobicity when in contact with air within a few minutes [74][75][76]. The hydrophilic treatments and some examples are discussed further in Section 5. Another method is physisorption, which is a simple and efficient approach that relies on surface hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. This method includes the following techniques: layer-by-layer deposition; non-ionic surfactants; charged polymers. The disadvantages are the lack of covalent bonds between PDMS and surface modifiers, which lead to the loss of modifiers quickly through desorption [77][78][79].Strategies employed in attempting to solve PDMS hydrophobicity include surface activation methods such as: oxygen plasma; UV/ozone treatments; corona discharges, which are widely used for PDMS surface oxidation to promote microchannel wettability.

        <p>In order to improve the difficulties encountered in physisorption, chemical modification methods allow for maintaining a long-term stability of the modified surface.

        <p>Adding waxes such as paraffin or beeswax to PDMS has been demonstrated to potentially increase the corrosion resistance, hydrophobicity and thermal and optical properties of PDMS, which is useful in applications such as sensors, wearable devices and superhydrophobic coating [83].Adding waxes such as paraffin or beeswax to PDMS has been demonstrated to potentially increase the corrosion resistance, hydrophobicity and thermal and optical properties of PDMS, which is useful in applications such as sensors, wearable devices and superhydrophobic coating [83].</p>
        <p>Although the methods listed above have been successful in improving the hydrophilicity of the PDMS surface, they have some limitations, such as chemical instability, the need for specific equipment, limited manufacturing process for large scale and some methods cause loss of transparency, loss of mechanical properties and do not provide the hydrophilic surface for a long period of time [62]. Considering these facts, the work of Gökaltun et al. [84] presents a simplified method of easy manufacture, which uses copolymers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) and PDMS segments (PDMS-PEG) to reduce the hydrophobicity of PDMS without changing its transparency, biocompatibility and mechanical properties, with a durability of 20 months.Although the methods listed above have been successful in improving the hydrophilicity of the PDMS surface, they have some limitations, such as chemical instability, the need for specific equipment, limited manufacturing process for large scale and some methods cause loss of transparency, loss of mechanical properties and do not provide the hydrophilic surface for a long period of time [62].

        <p>Sylgard ® 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit is the most used commercial PDMS. It consists of a monomer and a curing agent, which are usually combined at a weight ratio of 10:1. The compound is mixed and then degassed with a desiccator in order to prevent the formation of micro-bubbles. The PDMS solution is poured over the master mould and then cured in the oven [23]. The curing time depends on the temperature of the oven and on the size of the PDMS sample. The higher the hardening temperature, the less time it will take for the PDMS to cure. After the curing process, the piece is taken out of the mould [57]. Note that, for very specific applications and complex geometries, it is usually advised to perform the curing process at room temperature for at least 48 h [55,85]. In Table 2 are listed curing times and temperatures recommended by the manufacturer.Sylgard ® 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit is the most used commercial PDMS.

        <p>Table 2. Recommended curing times and temperatures to produce PDMS samples [57]. The monomer and the curing agent can be mixed at a different ratio besides the 10:1 [86] and, as a consequence, some properties change, namely, mechanical [87], optical [88] and gas permeability [89]. Mixing at a higher ratio of cure agent results in a faster hardening time, in a less sticky cured PDMS and in a more fragile PDMS sample. In contrast, mixing with less cure agent results in a longer hardening time, in a stickier cured PDMS and in better mechanical properties. Khanafer et al. [87] found that elastic modulus increases as the mixing ratios increase up to 9:1, after which the elastic modulus starts to decrease as the mixing ratio continues to increase.Table 2.

        <p>PDMS is patterned through commonly used microfabrication techniques, such as soft-lithography and spin coating. However, especially due to its hydrophobic nature, some of the techniques must be employed alongside with hydrophilic treatments, such as oxygen plasma. Soft-lithography, which is a group of techniques that use patterned elastomers as stamp, mould or mask to generate micropatterns, was developed to allow processing elastomers [100]. However, the fabrication of the most microfluidic devices still relies on photolithography for fabricating SU-8 masters that usually serve as the PDMS mould [20]. Photolithography is a microfabrication technique used to process photoresists, commonly employed in CMOS microelectronics fabrication [101]. The softlithography can be performed in several types, such as microcontact printing (µCP), replica moulding (REM), micro-transfer moulding (µTM), micro-moulding in capillaries (MIMIC), solvent-assisted micro-moulding (SAMIM), phase-shift photolithography, cast moulding, embossing and injection.

        <p>The soft-lithography process begins with the preparation of the elastomeric stamp or the mould by cast moulding. Most of the time, cast moulding implies the use of photolithographic techniques to fabricate the master.

In this process, a liquid film is spread by centrifugal force onto a rotating substrate. This technique is commonly used for deposition of polymer resist layers in the photolithographic processing of a master mould. It is formulation dependent: increased amounts of cross-linker agent in the formulation decrease film thickness [21,102].Additionally, spin coating is a common microfabrication method for producing polymer films of controlled and uniform thickness.

        <p>The hydrophobic nature of PDMS brings, in some cases, limitations in the microfabrication processes. There are applications, such as cell culture, immunoassay and biomolecule separation, where the modification of the hydrophobic surface of native PDMS to a hydrophilic surface is indispensable. For example, when endothelial cell seeding is needed, hydrophilic modification of the PDMS surface is indispensable for a successful seeding [103]. However, it is important that the hydrophilic treatment does not affect its transparency, as transparency is a key property that makes PDMS the material of choice for certain applications. Oxygen plasma is the most employed treatment that leads to an increase in PDMS surface hydrophilicity because of its short treatment time, its easy operation and that it does not affect the PDMS transparency [21, 65,104,105]. However, this treatment is also known for losing its effects within minutes after exposure to air. For this reason, a variety of well-studied treatments have emerged for this purpose [19,[69][70][71][72][73]. Additionally, some articles reported that oxygen plasma may damage PDMS surface [62,106] and, therefore, Shin et al. reported three different treatments that do not require oxygen plasma pre-treatment, including Teflon coating, commercially available water-repellents and perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) [107]. The authors showed that the Teflon and the water-repellent decreased the hydrophobicity of PDMS with great chemical stability and without significantly affecting its transparency. UV/ozone treatments and corona discharge are also commonly employed hydrophilic treatments; however, as with oxygen plasma treatment, PDMS quickly recovers its hydrophobicity [62]. There have been efforts to improve some of these treatments; however, the best way to achieve an effective and long-lasting treatment seems to be the combination of a surface activation with a covalent surface functionalization [19,106]. For example, Zhao et al. [108] proposed a method where PDMS is firstly activated by oxygen plasma treatment and then it is coated with a zwitterionic poly(methacrylate) copolymer (PMGT). This method allowed for decreasing the water contact angle (WCA) of native PDMS from 108 • to 30 • , with a duration of at least 200 h. Further, Zhou et al. [19] suggest a combination of gas-phase with wet chemical methods in order to achieve a better surface stability in a shorter treatment time. Examples of these treatments are the combination of UV or plasma treatment and silanization, the combination of UV or plasma treatment and graft polymerization and the combination of plasma treatment and layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly.The hydrophobic nature of PDMS brings, in some cases, limitations in the microfabrication processes.

        <p>Sterilization is a required procedure for most biomedical applications. In some cases, this process must be done alongside the microfabrication process. There are three mainly used sterilization methods: cleaning with ethanol, ultraviolet light exposure and the steam autoclave procedure. Sterilization does not significantly affect PDMS hydropho-bicity. However, steam autoclaving increases the storage modulus and ultimate tensile stress [21, [109][110][111][112][113][114].Sterilization is a required procedure for most biomedical applications.

        <p>Rectangular microchannels are the most common geometry obtained by soft-lithography. However, this kind of geometry can lead to some erratic measurements because the shear stress imposed on the cell is different and, consequently, the pressure build-up in the channel is not the same as if it were built-up in a circular section [124]. Hence, studies have been conducted to establish methods that allow the construction of circular microchannels of PDMS. For example, Fiddes et al.

Then, through the polymerization of the oligomer and the removal of the solvent, the authors demonstrated the ability to control the shape and the diameter of the microchannel's crosssection.

        <p>The creation of microscale features on ceramics or polymers is simpler than on metal. Considering the fact that PDMS allows the fabrication of hydrophobic and smooth surfaces has led to their use for developing coatings that help in the osseointegration of implants [38][39][40][41][42]. Rossi de Aguiar et al. [38] studied a sol-gel coating based on PDMS for metallic surfaces such as titanium and stainless steel. The authors demonstrated that the hydrophobic nature of PDMS allows the formation of an anti-biofouling surface, preventing the bacterial adhesion. Additionally, Tran et al. [39] developed a coating that involved the hydrolysis and co-condensation of PDMS and tantalum (Ta) ethoxide to produce tantalum oxide. This PDMS hybrid material has biocompatibility and corrosion resistance properties, which allowed a great osseointegration. The integration of nanoparticles, such as CuO, has been proven to improve the antibacterial characteristic of PDMS-based coatings, as demonstrated by Tavakoli et al. [42]. Table 5 comprises a list of some PDMS-based coatings that have been developed in the past years.The creation of microscale features on ceramics or polymers is simpler than on metal.

        <p>Microchips for biomedical applications are devices that allow monitoring and analysis of samples. The use of PDMS in these devices offers great advantages such as optical transparency, being easy-to-manufacture and having a low-cost, which are important requirements when fabricating microchips. Additionally, the permeability to gases is a unique advantage to culture living cells in closed microchannels, a task that is extremely complex to achieve in glass microchannels. However, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS brings some limitations during the fabrication and flow transport phenomena, especially for biological applications. Developments of treatments that contradict the hydrophobic property have been made and these limitations are easily overcome by applying simple and fast hydrophilic treatments to PDMS. The lack of industrial processes to manufacture PDMS is still an issue. There are already methods that allow good replications of microfabricated PDMS; however, they are far from an industrial scale.Microchips for biomedical applications are devices that allow monitoring and analysis of samples.

        <p>Replication of the cardiovascular system using PDMS microchannels is on a good path to be an application well-suited for the study of cardiovascular diseases. The hyper-elastic behaviour and transparency are great advantages that make PDMS the chosen material in these types of applications. Herein, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS can be a limitation as well, in the blood flow itself but also when it is intended to grow endothelial cell cultures on its walls.Replication of the cardiovascular system using PDMS microchannels is on a good path to be an application well-suited for the study of cardiovascular diseases.

        <p>Additionally, PDMS plays an important role in medical implant applications, especially due to its biocompatibility and hydrophobic nature. These characteristics allow the production of antibacterial coatings for implants, which is a requirement when developing implants. PDMS also allows the production of smooth surfaces through processes of microfabrication that help in the osseointegration of the implant in the body.

        <p>It is interesting to note that the hydrophobic nature of PDMS can be a limitation in some applications, such as microchips and microchannel fabrication, but a great advantage in others, such as in implant coatings, solar panels and face masks.It is interesting to note that the hydrophobic nature of PDMS can be a limitation in some applications, such as microchips and microchannel fabrication, but a great advantage in others, such as in implant coatings, solar panels and face masks.</p>
        <p>In summary, PDMS opens a wide range of possibilities to make great developments in biomedical applications. With regards to further work, it is important to continue studying more methods to produce PDMS-based devices on a larger scale which would further enable these devices to reach the market. Additionally, the currently available PDMS hydrophilic treatments need further developments and improvements as, most of the time, they do not last long. Hence, it is important to develop new methods or improve the existing ones in order to achieve a higher permanent hydrophilic feature for PDMS.In summary, PDMS opens a wide range of possibilities to make great developments in biomedical applications.

        <p>• Tensile testing allows Young Modulus measurement of PDMS. The Young Modulus can be affected by treatments that may be applied to PDMS, by hardening temperature and time, and by the mixing ratio used to fabricate the PDMS samples [42,96,97]; • X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a technique based on the photoelectric effect, which allows identification of the elemental composition of the material. This method is useful when it is needed to verify if any changes in surface composition occurred after the PDMS received any treatment [38,39,98]; • Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a method used to obtain the infrared spectrum of absorption or transmission of the PDMS sample. This technique allows examination of the effect of some treatment on the cross-linking of PDMS [38,42,99].• Tensile testing allows Young Modulus measurement of PDMS.
