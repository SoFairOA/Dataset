        <p>Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions, in particular, for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently, minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (G N ). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), we show highperformance 3d-5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM-G N from the view of structure/coordination, formation energy, structural/electrochemical stability, electronic properties, electrical conductivity, and reaction mechanism, which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various -N n C m moieties, the -N 2 C 2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure -C 4 /C 3 and -N 4 /N 3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ ORR mechanism, completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N 2 C 2 templates, Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here, the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N), which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni-N 2 C 2 , Ni/Pd-C 4 , and Rh-N 4 , while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir</p>
        <p>Recently, it has been of utmost importance to develop highperformance, energy-efficient and eco-friendly electrocatalysts. These can be utilized for various types of electrochemical reactions 1,2 such as the HER, 3 OER/ORR, 4-7 water oxidation/ splitting, 8 fuel cell reactions, 9 carbon-oxidation/CO-reductionoxidation/CO 2 -reduction reactions, 10,11 MeOH/EtOH oxidation reactions, 12 nitrogen-reduction/ammonia-oxidation reactions, 13 peroxide/chlorine evolution reactions, 14 acid oxidation reaction, 15 etc. Until recently, most of these catalysts were usually made of highly expensive and scarce novel metals (Pt/Ir/Ru). 16 Hence, tremendous efforts have been paid to using a tiny amount of novel metal SAs/NPs 17,18 or replacing them with inexpensive alternatives. 19 In this regard, minimal amounts of metal (M) SAs [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs to glue atoms in defect sites of graphene (Gr) or other 2D materials. 17,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] However, while most metal NPs behave like conducting metals, metal SAs embedded in supports often lose some of the electric conductivity (s), because once embedded metal SAs are ligated by C/N atoms in vacant sites, the p-conjugation through C/N atoms in the 2D sheet can be lost. 17,27,28,31 This would cause a reduction in the kinetic reaction rate of SA electrocatalysts. 31,37,38 To maximize the catalytic performance, (TM)SA-embedded electrocatalysts need to be optimized in view of coordination-structure, stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. To this end, highthroughput computer screening is a powerful approach. [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] (TM)SA catalysts embedded in M-N 4 /C 4 and M-N 3 /C 3 moieties of G N /Gr have been reported to be promising as HER/OER/ORR electrocatalysts. 31,34 The localized d orbital energy levels in (TM)SAs are modified by the coordination environments. 47 Thus, they dictate the stability and activity of SAs. Also, they dictate the s when the (TM)SAs are embedded in p-conjugated G N , which enables fast transport of charges (i.e., electrons) in electrochemical reactions. 17 In this regard, we have considered 3d (Sc-Zn), 4d (Y-Cd), and 5d (La, and Hf-Hg) TMs in the mono/di-vacancy defect sites of G N . G N is particularly considered here because of its high s compared with that of Gr and its high tunability towards better electrochemical activity by a variety of coordination environments around a (TM)SA with tetra-coordination (-N n=0-4 C 4Àn ) in di-vacancy sites or tri-coordination (-N n=0-3 C 3Àn ) in monovacancy sites. We thus studied 11 different pyridinic/ graphitic-type defect configurations for each (TM)SA embedded in G N . For high-throughput computational screening towards high-performance electrocatalysts of (TM)SAs embedded in G N [M-N n C m -G N ], we have performed DFT calculations (see Method &amp; Tables S1 andS2, ESI †).</p>
        <p>Here we investigate the stability of each embedded (TM)SA, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) (which helps in characterization of the coordination environment of SAs onto the G N template), the electronic properties including s, the reaction mechanisms and the HER/OER/ORR activities of M-N n C m -G N . We find that the (TM)SAs, in particular, in the -N 2 C 2 moiety, display superior durability and high s in favour of fast HER reaction kinetics. These complicated electrochemical reactions have shown very different activities depending on different chemical environments and calculation methods, causing a lack of reliable clear-cut reference data. Thus, we report the lucid understanding of TM(SA) catalysts, in particular, for HER/OER/ORR towards water splitting and hydrogen fuel, which are vital for clean green energy environments such as hydrogen cars and electric power. We assess highly effective (TM)SAs ligated by various -N n C m , in particular, by -N 2 C 2 for superb electrochemical performance. The machine learning-based descriptors describing high-performance HER/OER/ORR catalysts are also assessed.</p>
        <p>To analyse the degree of formation and stability of various -N n C m moieties in G N /Gr defects, we study the representative pyridinic/graphitic-type defects and (TM)SA-embedded configurations and these formation energies including metal-embedding energies, based on the refined DFT method (Tables S1-S6, ESI †).</p>
        <p>Here we show that the (TM)SAs embedded in the -N 2 C 2 vacant sites are consistently the most stable among possible confor-</p>
        <p>SA-catalysts templated in G N are often synthesized using Gr, G N , N-containing carbon compounds (such as melamine) and other materials. 34,[48][49][50] In the absence of metals, it is not energetically easy to form significant vacancy sites in G N /Gr (based on Table S3, ESI †). M-N n C m -G N is often formed in the presence of (TM)SAs and N sources (NH 3 , N 2 H 4 , etc.) or N-containing carbon materials. 17,27,34,[48][49][50] According to our DFT-predicted formation energies of 11 different pyridinic/graphitic-type defect configurations (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI †) with optimal H atoms attached on edge C/N atoms (Fig. 2a and Table S3, ESI †), the -N n C m defect sites in G N can be formed easily in the presence of H atoms (which is naturally present even in moderately high vacuum) with the formation energies of B2 eV. The formation of pyrrolic defect sites is less favoured due to their higher formation energies (B5 eV) (Fig. S2 and Table S4, ESI †). We investigate the formation energies and metal embedding stabilities on the mono/ di-vacancy pyridinic defect sites with tri/tetra-coordination</p>
        <p>The stability criterion of ''metal embedding (embedding a metal atom into/onto the support)'' over ''metal cohesion (adding a metal atom to the bulk)'' is defined as the difference (E emb/coh = E emb À E Àcoh ) of the (TM)SA-embedding energy (E emb ) on G N (Fig. 2b and Tables S6, S7, ESI †) from the bulk cohesive energy (E coh = ÀE -coh ; Table S1, ESI †). Here, embedding energy is defined in a negative value. A more negative embedding energy means stronger embedding, while cohesion is generally defined by a positive value. If E emb/coh o 0, the embedding into graphene is preferred over metal clustering. However, even for small positive E emb/coh , the embedding into graphene can still be transiently stable unless the concentration of metal is significantly present to be able to form clusters.</p>
        <p>Embedding energy shows that the N 2 C 2 moiety is the most favorable for the M-N n C m -G N formation with the trend of embedding strength (ÀE emb ) in the order of N 2 C 2 4 (N 3 C 1 , N 2 C 2 b , and</p>
        <p>and N 2 C 2 c are the cis forms, while N 2 C 2 is the trans form; Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI †). The N 2 C 2 case shows high embedding stability of (TM)SA over TM-cohesion, and thus their SAs can be easily formed (shown in blue-to-yellow color in Fig. 2b). In contrast, the cases of N 1 C 2 , N 2 C 1 and N 3 are less stable than the (TM)-cohesion (shown in orange/red color). Thus, these SAs are not so stable that their clusters/NPs are formed. Most (TM)SAs are slightly large to fit into the di-vacant site of G N , but several of the (TM)SAs (such as (Mn/Fe), Co/Ni/ Cu/Zn/Pt) just fit into that site (Fig. S3 and Table S8, ESI †). The planar embedding structures are highly stable. However, in all -N n C 3Àn mono-vacancy moieties, all (TM)SAs are off the plane (cf. Fig. S1, ESI † where the TM is Zr located above the graphene sheet due to its slightly larger radius; Fig. S2 and Tables S8 andS9 (ESI †) which show the off-plane distances for various (TM)SA moieties before and after H-adsorption; Table S10, ESI † after O-adsorption.) 2 ) divacancy sites tend to be more bluish, while the -N n C 3Àn (particularly M-N 3 ) monovacancy sites tend to be more reddish (cf. Table S6 for E emb , Table S7 for E emb/coh , ESI †). In -N n C 3Àn mono-vacancy sites, all (TM)SAs are off the G N plane by 41.5 Å.</p>
        <p>by more than 1.5 Å. Upon *H/*O adsorption, a slight/small structural change can be noted (Fig. S4 and Tables S9, S10, ESI †).</p>
        <p>To understand the aggregation of SAs by clustering, we report the 2nd (TM)SA's clinging energy (E 2M ) and the (TM)SAstability over TM-cohesion (E 2M/coh ) (Tables S11 andS12, ESI †). A few M-N n=0-3 C 3Àn -G N systems have smaller E 2M/coh (or even negative values) than M-N n=0-4 C 4Àn -G N due to their weak metal-ligand interaction. Then, in some cases 2nd (TM)SAs bind the C atoms in the cases of -N 1 C 3 -G N and -C 4 -Gr sites, showing small E 2M/coh . The Hg/Cd/Zn/Ag/Au/Pd TMs have rather small E 2M/coh , and Mn/Cu have moderate values, while other (TM)SAs show large stability (43eV) over TM-cohesion. Since d-orbitals of (TM)SAs split due to the metal-ligand interaction by C/N atoms in G N , the 1st (TM)SAs hardly interact with the 2nd (TM)SAs.</p>
        <p>To analyse the electrochemical stability of a (TM)SA embedded in a -N n C m moiety, we investigate its stability over metal-aggregation and metal-dissolution. We find that the -N 2 C 2 moiety generally shows the highest durability against aggregation and dissolution.</p>
        <p>The electrochemical stability is governed by dissolution potential U ds ½¼ U ds ðbulk metalÞ À E emb=coh =en e , 51 where U ds is the standard dissolution potential (pH = 0) of bulk metal in aqueous solution, e is the electron charge, and n e is the number of electrons involved in dissolution. A more positive U ds relative to the equilibrium potential indicates that the metal atoms bind the M-N n C m -G N support more strongly and the dissolution of metal atoms can be better avoided under electrochemical reactions, which enhances the durability of (TM)SA in a harsh electrochemical environment. While there can be a different number of electron transfers in the dissolution process, we here use a broad range of U ds (40 V) based on the reported experimental studies on most of the synthesized (TM)SA-catalysts. 52 The stability against metal-aggregation and metal-dissolution in the M-N n C m -G N system is plotted in the E emb/coh vs. U ds plot (Fig. 3). Negative E emb/coh indicates the thermodynamical stability against clustering, while positive U ds reflects the electrochemical stability against dissolution. Following these two stability criteria, the whole figure is divided into four quadrants, depicted by blue, green, yellow, and pink. We set the stability criteria as the unaggregatable and indissoluble system with E emb/coh o 0 eV and U ds 4 0 V. It can be noted that most of the double vacancy systems are stable, and the -N 2 C 2 moiety is particularly stable among -N m C n moieties (Tables S13 andS14, ESI †). In contrast, most TM elements (except for La and Y) in mono-vacancy site of -N n=1-3 C 3Àn -G N (excluding -C 3 -Gr having weak stability) show poor stability over metal cohesion, and so these SAs tend to aggregate as clusters. This is a salient finding in that most studies for TM(SA) electrocatalysts in Gr/G N have focused on pure C(C 4 /C 3 ) or N(N 4 /N 3 ) coordination except for very recent studies showing remarkable electrocatalytic performance in both activity and durability by using the -N 2 C 2 moiety. 17,[27][28][29] Among all the M-N n C m -G N , we find that the -N 2 C 2 moieties show favorable E emb/coh and U ds values for promising hosts, which provide high durability for metal atoms. This finding would help in accelerating various SA-driven electrochemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Generally, the early (TM)SAs (Sc/Ti/Y/Zr/La/Hf) are more likely to be stabilized on the defective sites of the substrates, as indicated by the more negative E emb/coh values, while the late (TM)SAs (Co-Zn, Rh-Cd, and Ir-Hg) tend to be stabilized against electrolytic dissolution. Overall, (TM)SAs including Pt/Pd/Au/Ag/Cu/Ir/Rh/Ni in the -N 2 C 2 moiety display superior durability.</p>
        <p>The band structure is reflected in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), conductivity, catalytic activity, etc. The coordination environments of defect sites in G N affect the electronic properties of (TM)SAs and hence the thermodynamic adsorption/desorption strength of intermediates in electrochemical redox reactions. Here, we study the electronic properties of TM(SA) in M-N n C m -G N and XANES showing the coordination environments of a (TM)SA to aid experimental characterization.</p>
        <p>Fig. 4a-f show the projected density of states (PDOS) for (V/Ni/Zn)-N 2 C 2 -G N and (V/Ni/Zn)-N 3 -G N defect sites. Square planar complexes are stable as 16-electron species. 47 The Ni on a Ni-N 2 C 2 -G N (as Ni 2+ ion) has eight d electrons after forming four bonds with four C/N atoms, resulting in a 16-electron d 4 + dsp 2 electron configuration in the square-planar like structure (Fig. 4a). Early TM elements like V on di-vacancy sites cannot fill the 16-electron configuration, and so the orbitals are not occupied evenly, showing a magnetic property (Fig. 4b, Fig. S5, S6, Table S15, ESI †). Group 12 elements like Zn have fully occupied 10 d electrons in +2 oxidized states along with 8 electrons from -N 2 C 2 , resulting in 18 electrons in total (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, (TM)SAs on mono-vacancy sites have tetrahedral like structures. As an example, in Ni-N 3 -G N , the Ni atom (3d 8 4s 2 ) is tricoordinated to N atoms, resulting in 16 electrons in total around the Ni atom. The calculation shows d 9 electrons with one unoccupied minor spin state in the d-orbital (d xz ) due to the electron transfer to the N atoms, showing a magnetic moment (Fig. 4d). The magnetic properties can change upon *H/*O-adsorption (Fig. S7, S8 and Tables S16,S17, ESI †). The less oxidized metal atom can be found in early TM elements as in V-N 3 -G N (Fig. 4e) and group 12 elements as in Zn-N 3 -G N (Fig. 4f).</p>
        <p>From these differences, XANES of M-N n C m -G N systems show each characteristic peak. For example, the edge energy of XANES shifts according to the oxidization state of (TM)SAs. Also, the symmetry of the structure and p-d orbital hybridization increase the intensity of pre-edge peaks. The group of TM is another factor affecting XANES associated with the number of empty orbitals for electron excitation. The calculated K-edge XANES data of all 3d and 4d (TM)SAs are in Fig. S9 (ESI †), which are essential for analyzing the SA-coordination analysis but not available in the literature. In</p>
        <p>A good electrical conductivity is vital for high-performance electrocatalysts. This issue was not important in the past because the catalysts on electrodes were made with conductive metals or carbon materials, but nowadays the SA-embedded supports are not necessarily good conductors. Hence, s is an important issue in determining the kinetic reaction rate, in particular, in fast reactions such as the HER. However, there is no serious study on this issue except for our recent work. 17,27,28 In the HER, the reaction rates in (TM)SAs are often very fast by the Tafel mechanism where H 2 gas is released by combining two neighboring adsorbed H atoms on catalytic sites; thus, fast charge transfer plays a critical role. 31 This charge transfer effect is rather less important in the OER, which shows a rather sluggish reaction rate. Thus, we consider the fast H-adsorption in the HER. Here, the s for M-N n C m -G N before/after H-adsorption is calculated at 300 K and compared with the s of 2.1% N-doped G N [s o E 7 Â 10 2 s(Gr)] (Fig. S10 and Tables S18, S19, ESI †). Overall, M-N 2 C 2 tends to show higher s than any other double vacancy M-N n C m -G N system (Fig. 5). The change in electronic structure by coordination environment affects the s significantly. The covalent bonding of Gr is disrupted by (TM)SA-doping and N-adsorption; hence, the s of metal-doped G N tends to be much reduced, showing poor conductivity. Among the (TM)SAs, early We also study the s when O*, HO*, and HOO* are adsorbed on the active sites of M-N n C m -G N , where the s tends to decrease compared to the pristine case (Fig, S12 and Table S19b, ESI †). However, in the cases of OER/ORR, the overpotentials are large, and so lowering their high barriers, which exponentially forbid the charge transfer, is the critical issue, while the conductivity is not a significant issue unless it becomes very small.</p>
        <p>The HER of M-N n C m -G N is achieved through their active sites such as metal atom M, and bridge sites between M and C, or C/N atoms. One should also consider if the Kubas active site 54 can help in accelerating H 2 desorption by combining both H atoms, leading to a Tafel-like reaction. Here we assess high-performance HER SA catalysts.</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity is investigated in terms of H-adsorption binding/free energies (DE H* /DG H* in Tables S20 andS21, ESI †) for the intermediates during the HER. The solvent effect on the HER is rather insignificant within 0.03 eV for DE H* /DG H* (see Table S22, ESI †). The zero-point energy and entropy contributions to DG H* when H is on a metal atom show an almost constant shift by 0.24 eV (for H 2 ), 53 but this shift changes significantly when H is on a C/N atom or a bridging bond between metal and C/N atoms, and thus such a correction is made by phonon calculations. Then, the refined HER overpotential (Z HER , Tables S30a andS31 7a and in filled red triangle in Fig. 7b) and are likely to be super-performing HER catalysts, given that the Pt(111) surface shows ÀZ HER = 0.2 V on the fcc-hollow site. Indeed, Pt-N 2 C 2 (ÀZ expt/calc = 0.01-0.02/0.03 V), 17 Ru-N 2 C 2 (ÀZ expt/calc = 0.01-0.04/0.06 V) [27][28][29] and Rh-N 2 C 2 (ÀZ expt/calc = 0.04/0.06 V) 55 are reported as remarkably active HER (TM)SA catalysts. In these cases, the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N) except for Ru (Fig. 7a).</p>
        <p>It is generally expected that the strongest H-adsorption site for M-N n C m -G N is just metal-SA M, as noted in most of the previous literature, which did not consider other options. However, in certain cases it is a C or N site, while often sharing the metal site. The H adsorption sites can be shared by both metal and C (not N) (i.e., the bridge site denoted by a hat symbol in Fig. 7). The metal-adjacent C sites (but not N sites) are the most active in some cases of -</p>
        <p>, -N 1 C 3 , and -C 4 , while the N sites can be the most active in certain cases of -N 3 C 1 and -N 4 . In certain cases where a C or N site is the most active, the metal site View Article Online can be a coactive site. Among the active C/N atoms, the metals in Zr-C 4 and Pt-N 4 are nearly compatible in activity to the C and N atoms, respectively. In particular, when a H atom is adsorbed on 3d (Sc/Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Zn), 4d (Y/Rh/Pd), and 5d (Pt) TM-G N systems, the H tends to share a C site, while a H adsorbed on the (Ag/La/Pt)-G N system tends to be on C/N sites instead of metal sites (Fig. 7a). When a 2nd H atom is attached to the same TM atom embedded in G N , the Kubas active site 54 can help in accelerating H 2 desorption by combining both H atoms, leading to a Tafel-like reaction, but its role is not dominating in the HER reaction. The Volmer-Kubas structures and free energy changes for selected (TM)SAs in (N 2 C 2 ) systems are shown along with the PDOS of Ru upon H/2H-adsorption in Fig. S13, 14 and Table S23 (ESI †).</p>
        <p>We note that the (TM)SA-N n C m -G N catalysts show good performance in the OER/ORR, based on their overpotentials. Here, their OER/ORR performance and their preferred pathways among two different paths (I and II) are investigated and the predicted high-performance OER/ORR materials are assessed.</p>
        <p>We consider the catalytic activity in terms of the overpotential of the OER/ORR (Z OER /Z ORR ). The HO*/O*/HOO*-adsorption free energies (DG HO*/O*/HOO* ) are calculated by adding zero-point energy and entropic contributions to binding energies of each intermediate for path-I and path-II (Tables S24-S27, Methods, ESI †). Then, Z OER /Z ORR values are obtained from the free energies of intermediates during OER/ORR (Methods). The lowest Z OER /Z ORR values between path-I and path-II are reported. The solvent effect is important in particular for d 1 or d 2 SAs, while it is much less in other cases (Table S28 and S29, ESI †). Here we discuss the activities by taking into account the solvent effect.</p>
        <p>In the OER/ORR cases, only several TM(SA)s show good activity regardless of coordination environments (Fig. 8a). Among thermodynamically/electrochemically stable systems, the low Z OER /V values (compared with 0.43 AE 0.09 (upper limit: 0. S22, ESI †). Also, it is worthwhile to consider the Volmer-Kubas reaction free energies (Table S23, ESI †). ''*'' denotes unstable systems. The reddish colors represent near-zero free energies (responsible for near-zero overpotential). Zr/Ti/Ag/Cd- in N-doped carbon templates were reported to be better in performance than those in pure carbon templates, respectively, [57][58][59][60] while Co behaves better than Fe in both N-doped and un-doped carbon templates, respectively, 57 the results of which are consistent with our predicted values. Co-N 4 is predicted to be the most active for the ORR among Co-N n C m -G N , in agreement with experiments. 60 The HO* and HOO* are adsorbed on metal atoms much more strongly than on the surrounding C/N atoms. Although O* forms a bond with both M and C in certain cases, the active sites for the OER/ORR are metal sites in all investigated systems in contrast to those for the HER, which vary from metal to C/N or metal-C bridging site depending on the metal and ligands. As a result, the Z OER /Z ORR values of each (TM)SA are affected by the coordination environment.</p>
        <p>In general, OH À tends to be on top of O* to form HOO* (path I), known as the well-known OER/ORR mechanism. However, we find that in some systems the HO* adsorbs on the O-poisoned metal site (M-O*), which needs to be considered as the active site (path-II). Re/Os prefers path-II in all templates, while V/Nb Descriptors for HER/OER/ORR activity As a supervised machine learning approach to the classification of di-vacancy configurations into good and bad catalysts, we searched for a descriptor taking the properties of atomic elements constituting the configuration, which works universally for all M-N n C m -G N systems. We considered the following machine learning algorithms: Gaussian naı ¨ve Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, radius neighbor classifier, support vector classifier, neural network, and decision trees as well as the following ensemble methods: random forest, extremely randomized trees, and gradient boosting. The best hyper-parameters were found using an exhaustive search implemented in 
            <rs type="software">GridSearchCV</rs>. 61 We constructed the descriptors as Coulomb matrix elements (CM = Z 1 Z 2 /r 12 where Z = atomic number and r 12 = the distance from each other) 62 The present findings should be vital for the design of new (TM)SA catalysts for various electrocatalytic reactions.
        </p>
        <p>Spin-polarized DFT calculations using the 
            <rs type="software">Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)</rs> 64 are performed to optimize structures and to obtain electronic properties. Instead of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 65 exchange-correlation functional (which is commonly used for bulk systems), the revised PBE (RPBE) type 66 (which was optimized for surface states) is used for these 2-dimensional (2D) systems with Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) 67 dispersion correction. For 3d metals, the Hubbard U eff correction 68 (with the values of 2.11, 2.58, 2.72, 2.79, 3.06, 3.29, 3.42, 3.40, 3.87, and 4.12 eV in the order of Sc through Zn) is included based on the literature. 39 Given that our focus is more on the surface phenomena, the RBPE(U)+TS method is employed here. The RPBE+TS results without U are also provided for a guide even for 3d elements because the experimental cohesive energies and interatomic distances of TMs tend to be between RPBE(U)+TS and RPBE+TS values (Tables S1 andS2, ESI †). Thus, in the evaluation of Z, we may consider both U=0 and U values as the upper/lower limits, or simply consider their mid value with the error bar (e) as the half of their difference (see the legend of Table S30, ESI †). Bulk transition metals are optimized with the conjugated gradient algorithm using a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 11 Â 11 Â 11 special k points and 700 eV cutoff for the kinetic energy and the Gaussian smearing method with an energy width of 0.02 eV. Crystal structures for all bulk transition metals are used for their primitive unit cells and their lattice vectors. Despite the fact that the dispersion correction (which is not present in PBE results) is essential, the TS dispersion correction (PBE+TS) tends to overestimate the experimental TM cohesive energies probably because the parameters of the PBE functional (without considering dispersion correction) were optimized directly for the experimental data. The Hubbard U correction is also necessary for self-energy correction in order to obtain more reliable electronic structure such as a band gap, but it tends to underestimate cohesive energies. Since the parameters of PBE were optimized for bulk materials, RPBE was introduced to give better surface energies. 69 In this regard, RPBE(U)+TS is expected to better describe the 2D systems including both 3d TMs and p systems (such as Gr and G N ).

        <p>Energy &amp; Environmental Science Thus, we have chosen the RPBE(U) + TS method to study free energies of (TM)SAs embedded in 2D G N , while taking into account spin polarization. For the study of the catalytic phenomena, the projector augmented wave (PAW) 70 pseudopotentials are employed and the kinetic energy cutoff for plane-wave expansions is set to 500 eV with Gaussian broadening by 0.05 eV. Each energy of (TM)SA is optimized in the asymmetric supercell (19 Å Â 20 Å Â 21 Å) for a better description of their degeneracy states using the G point. Each isolated (TM)SA is embedded in a Gr supercell composed of 48 C atoms, and 7 Â 7 Â 1 k-point sampling is used. Geometric relaxations are done until the Hellman-Feynman forces converge to 0.01 eV Å.</p>
        <p>The solvation effect is considered using the pure implicit model implemented in VASPsol 71 and the explicit model (which uses an implicit model in the presence of one water molecule added explicitly to the system). For the HER overpotentials, the solvent effect is found to be insignificant (no more than 0.03 eV for DG H* ) (Table S22, ESI †), so it was not necessary to include the solvent effect in HER analysis. In the case of the Mn system, the magnetic moment of the metal atom changes in the implicit solvation model, resulting in 0.09 eV in free energy change, but it does not change in the explicit model, which is more reliable, resulting in an insignificant solvent effect on the DG H* . However, the solvent effect is somewhat significant in the OER/ORR, and so it is included in our results and discussion (Tables S27-S29, ESI †). In a bulk dielectric medium the implicit solvent model would be reliable, while in ~1 nm-sized confined medium the Debye screening is far from complete, and so the dielectric constant is much reduced due to the limited polarization arising from the rotationally forbidden surface water molecules at catalytic sites. Owing to the much reduced dielectric effect of interfacial water, the implicit solvent effect could overestimate the solvent effects on Z of (TM)SA catalysts embedded on G N /Gr. In this regard, we consider both vacuum and implicit solvent models as the upper/lower limits, namely the mid value with the error bar as the half of their difference (see the legend of Table 30, ESI †).</p>
        <p>While the HER is a fast reaction, the OER is a sluggish reaction, which generates oxygen gas through several electron/proton complex reaction pathways. The OER consists of four elementary steps, which strongly depend on the pH of the reaction medium.</p>
        <p>In acidic pH, the reaction operates via oxidation of two water molecules to form one oxygen molecule with four proton-coupled electron transfer steps, while in basic pH, the four hydroxyl groups are converted into O 2 and two water molecules with four electron transfer steps. ORR kinetics is also generally slow. In acidic conditions, O 2 reduces to H 2 O with four proton-coupled electron transfer steps, while in basic conditions, O 2 reduces to OH À with four electron transfer steps. The reactions for the HER, OER and ORR in acidic and basic pH are summarized as follows. 31,72,73 The detailed mechanisms we considered are described below.</p>

        <p>We have considered various OER and ORR mechanisms, as shown below. The overpotential of each mechanism is calculated from the maximum difference between the Gibbs free energies in each step, as provided for path-I in (37) and (38). The lowest overpotential values for the best pathway are reported in Tables S28-S29 (ESI †). 53 For the active site and adsorbates, their TS values are 0 eV.</p>

        <p>Electrical conductivities (s) are calculated using the Boltzmann transport theory 74 and the scattering rates t are assumed to be the same as E100 fs for G N . 75 X-ray absorption near edge structures for all optimized structures are calculated by using the FDMNES code. 76 Muffin-tin approximation and the Hedin-Lundqvist functional are used to conduct full multiple scattering calculations. The spectra are convoluted using the Lorentzian function.</p>
