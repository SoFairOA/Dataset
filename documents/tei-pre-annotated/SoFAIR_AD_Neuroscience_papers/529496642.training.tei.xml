        <p>Activated T cells secrete interferon-γ, which triggers intracellular tryptophan shortage by upregulating the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme [1][2][3][4] . Here we show that despite tryptophan depletion, in-frame protein synthesis continues across tryptophan codons. We identified tryptophan-to-phenylalanine codon reassignment (W&gt;F) as the major event facilitating this process, and pinpointed tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS1) as its source. We call these W&gt;F peptides 'substitutants' to distinguish them from genetically encoded mutants. Using large-scale proteomics analyses, we demonstrate W&gt;F substitutants to be highly abundant in multiple cancer types. W&gt;F substitutants were enriched in tumours relative to matching adjacent normal tissues, and were associated with increased IDO1 expression, oncogenic signalling and the tumour-immune microenvironment. Functionally, W&gt;F substitutants can impair protein activity, but also expand the landscape of antigens presented at the cell surface to activate T cell responses. Thus, substitutants are generated by an alternative decoding mechanism with potential effects on gene function and tumour immunoreactivity.Activated T cells secrete interferon-γ, which triggers intracellular tryptophan shortage by upregulating the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme [1][2][3][4] .

        <p>Activated T cells infiltrating the tumour microenvironment secrete interferon-γ (IFNγ) that induces expression of the enzyme IDO1 in cancer cells. IDO1 catabolizes tryptophan to generate metabolites along the kynurenine pathway to subvert T cell immunity [1][2][3][4] . IFNγ also stimulates T cell activity by upregulating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) levels at the cell surface 5 and increases the repertoire of epitopes by producing aberrant frameshifted proteins through intracellular IDO1-mediated tryptophan depletion 6 . In addition to frameshifting ribosomes [6][7][8] , amino acid shortages can elicit codon reassignments in bacteria and yeast, thereby altering the decoding of a codon irrespective of its mRNA context to promote in-frame protein synthesis [9][10][11] . Additionally, codon reassignment due to alternative tRNA aminoacylation has been observed in yeast, where the CUG codon is decoded as both serine and leucine 12 . In mammals, evidence for codon reassignments is so far restricted to methionine codons. Owing to mis-aminoacylation triggered by virus exposure and selenium deficiency, cysteine is incorporated at a UGA stop codon instead of selenocysteine in rat liver cells [13][14][15] . However, the effects of tryptophan depletion on in-frame protein synthesis are unknown.Activated T cells infiltrating the tumour microenvironment secrete interferon-γ (IFNγ) that induces expression of the enzyme IDO1 in cancer cells.

        <p>To examine specific alterations in protein synthesis following tryptophan depletion induced by IFNγ treatment, we used MD55A3 melanoma cells stably expressing V5-ATF4 1-63 -tGFP in-frame and +1 out-of-frame reporters 6 . In these vectors, a tryptophan-less turboGFP gene (tGFP) is placed either in-frame or out-of-frame (+1) downstream of an unstable V5-tagged ATF4 fragment comprising residues 1-63 that includes a single tryptophan at position 93 (W93). The +1 vector leads to the expression of a shorter protein owing to a premature stop codon (marked with an asterisk in Extended Data Fig. 1a). We expected that IFNγ-induced tryptophan depletion would block in-frame mRNA translation downstream of the tryptophan codon while inducing the out-of-frame tGFP, as previously reported 6 . However, immunoblotting with anti-V5 revealed the accumulation of both out-of-frame tGFP and in-frame proteins from the +1-construct when intracellular tryptophan was completely depleted after IFNγ treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Similar results were obtained in the case of the in-frame construct, and when cells were deprived of tryptophan (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). The production of tGFP was verified by anti-tGFP staining (Extended DataTo examine specific alterations in protein synthesis following tryptophan depletion induced by IFNγ treatment, we used MD55A3 melanoma cells stably expressing V5-ATF4 1-63 -tGFP in-frame and +1 out-of-frame reporters 6 .

        <p>Possible alternative in-frame decoding mechanisms following amino acid deprivation are codon reassignment and translational bypass. These processes result in the incorporation of a different amino acid than is encoded for in the mRNA and the interruption of translation followed by downstream continuation 9,10,16,17 (Fig. 1a). Whether these processes occur in human cells is currently unknown. To identify alternative decoding mechanisms experimentally, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of V5-tag-immunoprecipitated proteins (V5-IP/MS) from lysates obtained from either mock-or IFNγ-treated +1 vector-expressing cells. We then searched for control out-of-frame tGFP peptides and for all possible codon reassignment and translational bypass events that may arise at codon W93. We confirmed the presence of tGFP peptides originating from frameshift events following IFNγ treatment, but detected no translational bypass events 6,8 (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1f) . Instead, a specific and exclusive tryptophan to phenylalanine codon reassignment (W93F) appeared only in the IFNγ treatment condition (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1f). Globally, although IFNγ treatment decreased the detection of peptides originating from the in-frame sequence, including the peptide spanning the single W93, both out-of-frame tGFP peptides and the W93F peptide were markedly induced (Extended Data Fig. 1g). No other codon reassignment was enriched upon IFNγ treatment at this tryptophan codon or its surroundings (Fig. 1c), indicating this is a major and exclusive translational event. To support the above observations, we depleted the same cells of tryptophan, and performed V5-IP/MS analyses. Here too, we observed specific and exclusive W93F peptides (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1h-j). By comparison, depletion of either tyrosine (Y) or phenylalanine (F) did not lead to any W93F, but rather to changes in Y99F (after tyrosine depletion), and F76Y and F76L (after phenylalanine depletion; Extended Data Fig. 1d,k). Together, these results indicate that in the context of our reporter vector, amino acid deprivations induce codon reassignments that are highly specific with respect to the mis-incorporated amino acid.Possible alternative in-frame decoding mechanisms following amino acid deprivation are codon reassignment and translational bypass.

        <p>Next, we sought to address whether tryptophan to phenylalanine codon reassignments (W&gt;F) facilitate the generation of full-length proteins in the absence of tryptophan. For this purpose, we substituted a conserved phenylalanine at position 26 with tryptophan in the otherwise tryptophan-less tGFP (tGFP(F26W)), which abolished the fluorescent signal of this protein (Extended Data Fig. 1l). We, hypothesized that if tryptophan shortage can lead to stable W&gt;F, then green fluorescence should appear following the generation of the mature wild-type protein. Indeed, in response to either IFNγ treatment or tryptophan depletion, the fluorescent signal of tGFP(F26W) increased in comparison to the control (Fig. 1e). The IFNγ-induced tGFP(F26W) signal was negated by IDO1 inhibition (IDOi), pinpointing the causal role of tryptophan shortage (Fig. 1e). In contrast to tGFP(F26W), neither IFNγ treatment nor direct tryptophan depletion of cells containing a control tGFP(F26A) construct affected the green fluorescent signal (Extended Data Fig. 1m,n). Expansion of this analysis to other cell lines indicated a wider phenomenon neither restricted to MD55A3 cells nor to melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 1o). The observation that not all cell lines showed increased tGFP(F26W) signal by tryptophan depletion (that is, MCF7, RPE-1 and MCF10A) may indicate it is a regulated process.Next, we sought to address whether tryptophan to phenylalanine codon reassignments (W&gt;F) facilitate the generation of full-length proteins in the absence of tryptophan.

        <p>The observed induction of W93F, F76Y and Y99F codon reassignments cannot be explained by alternative codon-anticodon interactions. Instead, the aromatic nature of the amino acids involved suggests an error in aminoacylation in the absence of the cognate depleted amino acid. We therefore tested the capacity of recombinant WARS1 to activate amino acids other than tryptophan 11 . WARS1 was able to activate both tryptophan and phenylalanine, but not control amino acids such as serine, methionine and glycine (Fig. 1f). This indicates that phenylalanine is a potential substrate of WARS1 in the absence of tryptophan, and suggests that compromised specificity of amino acid tRNA synthetases may be the source of W&gt;F.The observed induction of W93F, F76Y and Y99F codon reassignments cannot be explained by alternative codon-anticodon interactions.

        <p>Next, we searched for W&gt;F peptides in endogenous proteins in cells treated with IFNγ. We exposed MD55A3 melanoma cells to IFNγ, performed 2D liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in duplicate, and searched for W&gt;F in the entire proteome. After stringent filtering, we identified a significantly higher number of W&gt;F events induced by IFNγ compared with the control (Extended Data Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). This enrichment was unique for W&gt;F, and was not observed for other tested control codon reassignments (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a-e). Additionally, the observed W&gt;F enrichment was significant (P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 ) in the context of reduced global expression of peptides in the whole proteome, probably caused by enhanced proteolysis and reduced mRNA translation by IFNγ (Fig. 2b). Fig. 1 | Reporter assays identify IFNγ-induced W&gt;F codon reassignment. a, A model depicting possible mechanisms that could allow mRNA translation to proceed in case of amino acid shortages. In addition to ribosomal frameshifting, in-frame translation in the absence of tryptophan could be facilitated by codon reassignment or translational bypass. b, MD55A3 melanoma cells expressing V5-ATF4 -tGFP +1 were treated with or without IFNγ (48 h) (IFN) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 and analysed by mass spectrometry.

Each column represents an independent biological replicate. c, Heat map depicting log 2 differences in intensities between mock-and IFNγ-treated conditions for codon reassignment events for each of the amino acids in the tryptic peptide spanning the W93 codon. This heat map is based on two biological replicates. Further analysis of the proteins carrying W&gt;F indicated that they are neither highly expressed nor differentially expressed before or after IFNγ treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2f), suggesting that this is a global phenomenon not directly associated with the abundance of proteins. Similar to IFNγ, tryptophan deprivation caused a specific enrichment of W&gt;F that was not observed for other control codon reassignments (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 2g, Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, this W&gt;F enrichment was specifically observed upon tryptophan depletion and not upon tyrosine depletion (Fig. 2c). The enrichment for tryptophan-depletion-induced W&gt;F peptides (44 versus 4) is highly significant, considering the globally reduced protein expression (P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 ; Fig. 2b,d). Specific enrichment of W&gt;F following treatment with IFNγ was also apparent in other cell types 18 (RA and HROG02 glioblastoma cell lines; Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2k-m). Together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism of alternative decoding mechanism following amino acid deprivation in human cells. We therefore named these inducible codon reassignments 'substitutants' to distinguish them from genetically encoded mutants.Next, we searched for W&gt;F peptides in endogenous proteins in cells treated with IFNγ.

We therefore named these inducible codon reassignments 'substitutants' to distinguish them from genetically encoded mutants.</p>
        <p>Notably, 11 W&gt;F substitutants were detected both in tryptophandepleted and IFNγ-treated MD55A3 cells, confirming their specificity (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 2n). This list included peptides from categories of proteins with different functionalities (for example, RNA binding, ribosome constituents and oxoreductase activity). Of particular interest, the W&gt;F observed in the peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) protein has already been reported to lose affinity for cyclosporin, leading to its inactivation 19,20 . Also, the W&gt;F in YBX1 protein has been shown to cause decreased binding to C5-methlycytosine (m5C)-containing mRNAs, thereby reducing selectivity towards m5C-containing RNAs 21 . A more global structural analysis of W&gt;F in the detected proteins suggests a wide range of effects enforced by tryptophan shortage on protein activity and function (Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, some of the detected W&gt;F peptides contained two or even three conversions (for example, P3H3; Extended Data Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1-3), suggesting effective and iterative W&gt;F at the tryptophan-starved codons.Notably, 11 W&gt;F substitutants were detected both in tryptophandepleted and IFNγ-treated MD55A3 cells, confirming their specificity (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 2n).

        <p>To expand our proteomic analyses, we mined the proteomes of the Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) dataset 22 . Initially, we examined squamous cell lung cancer 23 (LSCC), a large-scale collection of 205 samples (104 tumours and 101 adjacent normal tissues). Proteomics analysis with highly stringent filtering criteria uncovered a large number of W&gt;F substitutants, which was significantly higher than any other W&gt;X possibilities (Fig. 3a). The detected W&gt;F were expressed less consistently across samples as compared to any other substitutants (Extended Data Fig. 3), suggesting variability in their expression across samples.To expand our proteomic analyses, we mined the proteomes of the Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) dataset 22 .

        <p>Since the LSCC proteomics dataset contained tumours as well as adjacent normal tissues, we next examined the relative enrichment of W&gt;F substitutants and stratified the samples by IDO1 expression. This analysis identified a significantly higher number of W&gt;F events in tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the association of W&gt;F substitutants to IDO1 expression level was specific to tumours and not seen in normal tissues (Fig. 3b). In contrast, W&gt;Y substitutions showed neither enrichment in number, nor association to tumours or IDO1 expression (Fig. 3b).Since the LSCC proteomics dataset contained tumours as well as adjacent normal tissues, we next examined the relative enrichment of W&gt;F substitutants and stratified the samples by IDO1 expression.

        <p>Spurred by this result, we searched for gene-expression signatures associated with the occurrence of W&gt;F substitutants in tumours relative to adjacent normal tissues. We calculated the number of substitutants in tumour samples with high (log intensity greater than 0) and low (log intensity less than 0) expression for every gene. This analysis led to clustering of genes into three categories (Fig. 3c,red). The major cluster represents the vast majority of genes that do not associate with the W&gt;F substitutants landscape. The other two clusters represent genes whose expression is either relatively high in tumours with a high number of W&gt;F substitutants (W&gt;F high), or relatively low in tumours with a high number of W&gt;F substitutants (W&gt;F low). Examination of gene ontologies enriched in the W&gt;F high cluster linked this type of substitutants with a high immune response, vesicular transport and peptide presentation (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Table 4, 5). By contrast, ontologies related to chromatin, p53 activity and SUMOlyation were enriched in the W&gt;F low cluster (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, adjacent normal tissues showed no clustering or enrichment with any gene-expression signature, indicating that W&gt;F substitutants and their associated pathways are a tumour-specific phenomenon (Fig. 3c, green). Finally, a similar analysis of control W&gt;Y substitutions showed no association with gene-expression clusters, providing evidence for the specific appearance of W&gt;F substitutants in human tumours (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 24 further substantiated the link between the occurrence of W&gt;F substitutants and T cell activation index, specifically in tumours and not in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 3d).

        <p>An independent proteomics analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 25 (PDA) supported a more specific expression of W&gt;F compared with other substitutions (Extended Data Fig. 3), and linked the expression of W&gt;F substitutants in tumours with high levels of infiltrating T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c, Supplementary Tables 5,7).An independent proteomics analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 25 (PDA) supported a more specific expression of W&gt;F compared with other substitutions (Extended Data Fig. 3), and linked the expression of W&gt;F substitutants in tumours with high levels of infiltrating T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c, Supplementary Tables 5,7).</p>
        <p>Observing W&gt;F substitutants in two independent tumour types led us to complete the analysis of all available tumour types present in CPTAC database, including liver 26 (HCC, 331 samples), head and neck 27 (HNSCC, 158 samples), uterine carcinoma 28 (UCEC, 149 samples), breast cancer 29 (BC, 108 samples), glioblastoma 30 (GBM, 111 samples), ovarian cancer 31,32 (OV, 107 samples), renal cancer 33 (CCRCC, 194 samples) and lung adenocarcinoma 34 (LUAD, 217 samples) . Figure 3f shows that W&gt;F is highly enriched (in comparison to average W&gt;X substitutants) in multiple tumour types, and is significantly higher than W&gt;Y in every case except for LUAD. Thresholding for the fold differences between enrichment of W&gt;F and W&gt;Y events classified all tumour types except CCRCC and LUAD as enriched in W&gt;F substitutants (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 3), indicating that it is a widespread phenomenon in human cancer.Observing W&gt;F substitutants in two independent tumour types led us to complete the analysis of all available tumour types present in CPTAC database, including liver 26 (HCC, 331 samples), head and neck 27 (HNSCC, 158 samples), uterine carcinoma 28 (UCEC, 149 samples), breast cancer 29 (BC, 108 samples), glioblastoma 30 (GBM, 111 samples), ovarian cancer 31,32 (OV, 107 samples), renal cancer 33 (CCRCC, 194 samples) and lung adenocarcinoma 34 (LUAD, 217 samples) .

        <p>To support the link between tumour immunological microenvironment and W&gt;F expression we analysed a dataset of patient-derived breast cancer xenografts (PDX) expanded in immunodeficient mice 35 (27 samples). Unlike breast cancers in their native microenvironment, PDX samples did not show an enrichment of W&gt;F substitutants (Fig. 3g), indicating that the host tumour microenvironment and a compatible immune response are required for W&gt;F substitutants. This observation is strengthened by the link between the T cell activation pathway and the occurrence of W&gt;F substitutants in all tumour types except GBM and OV (Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 4d-j, Supplementary Table 6).To support the link between tumour immunological microenvironment and W&gt;F expression we analysed a dataset of patient-derived breast cancer xenografts (PDX) expanded in immunodeficient mice 35 (27 samples).

        <p>Together, global analysis of multiple panels of cancer proteomes and phospho-proteomes exposed the specific appearance of W&gt;F substitutants and uncovered molecular pathways associated with their efficient expression. Intra-tumour T cell activity, high level of IDO1, and certain oncogenic signalling pathways are thus proposed to stimulate W&gt;F substitutants.Together, global analysis of multiple panels of cancer proteomes and phospho-proteomes exposed the specific appearance of W&gt;F substitutants and uncovered molecular pathways associated with their efficient expression.

        <p>Next, we tested whether the induction of W&gt;F substitutants following IFNγ treatment can alter the landscape of antigens presented at the cell surface. We used the model peptide SIINFEKL from chicken ovalbumin, which binds mouse H2-Kb and can be detected in this context by a monoclonal H2-Kb-bound SIINFEKL antibody in a flow cytometry assay 36 . The SIINFEKL peptide contains a phenylalanine residue at its centre, and can therefore be exploited to examine the effect of W&gt;F substitutants Wilcoxon unpaired two-sample t-test; ***P = 0.008892 for within-tumour comparison, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 for normal-tumour comparison. c, Top, scatter contour plot depicting the number of W&gt;F substitutants per gene when the gene is expressed at a higher (intensity &gt; 0, x-axis) or lower (intensity &lt; 0, y-axis) level than in surrounding normal tissue.

ER, endoplasmic reticulum. on the presentation of peptides at the cell surface (Fig. 4a). The H2-Kb binding affinity prediction using NetMHC4.0 server 37 indicated that although SIINFEKL is a strong binder to H2-Kb (affinity &lt; 20 nM), SIIN-wEKL is a weak binder (affinity &lt; 400 nM) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We therefore engineered MD55A3 melanoma cells to express H2-Kb, and SIINFEKL, SIINwEKL, SIINaEKL or SIINFwKL downstream of V5-ATF4 1-63 (W93Y)-tGFP, (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Immunoblot analysis with V5 or anti-tGFP antibodies reveals similar intracellular levels of all protein products (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that whereas SIINFEKL resulted in the expected antibody recognition at the cell surface of untreated cells, the SIINwEKL peptide did not (Fig. 4b). As predicted from W&gt;F substitutants by tryptophan depletion, a significant SIINFEKL signal was detected in the IFNγ-treated SIINwEKL cells, which was negated by IDOi treatment (Fig. 4b). By contrast, control alternative genetically encoded SIINFEKL mutations showed no signal.Next, we tested whether the induction of W&gt;F substitutants following IFNγ treatment can alter the landscape of antigens presented at the cell surface.

        <p>To examine the ability of T cells to recognize the presentation of IFNγ-induced substitutants, we co-cultured MD55A3-H2-Kb-SIINFEKL and SIINwEKL cells with T cells derived from OT-1 mice (harbouring the anti-SIINFEKL transgenic T cell receptor 36 ), and examined their reactivity by measuring intracellular IFNγ accumulation. To prevent T cell inactivation by IFNγ-induced kynurenine, we supplemented samples with kynureninase 38 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). SIINFEKL-presenting cells induced a response in about 20% of the T cells, whereas SIINwEKL-producing cells did not induce any response. Of note, treatment of MD55A3-H2-Kb-SIINwEKL cells with IFNγ led to T cell activation of approximately 5% of the T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5e). This effect was negated by the addition of IDOi, indicating dependency on IFNγ-induced tryptophan depletion by IDO1. Similar but more potent results were obtained with the HT29 colorectal cancer cell line, where a combined treatment of IFNγ with tryptophan depletion showed an especially strong W&gt;F substitution presentation and T cell recognition (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 5f,g). Notably, whereas SIINwEKL presentation induced only weak T cell recognition (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 5e), the extent of SIINwEKL&gt;SIINFEKL substitutants was sufficient to stimulate very efficient T cell killing of cells that were pre-treated with IFNγ and tryptophan depletion (Fig. 4d). Thus, W&gt;F substitutants produced by tryptophan depletion can result in antigen presentation at the cell surface that can lead to potent T cell recognition, activation and killing of cancer cells.To examine the ability of T cells to recognize the presentation of IFNγ-induced substitutants, we co-cultured MD55A3-H2-Kb-SIINFEKL and SIINwEKL cells with T cells derived from OT-1 mice (harbouring the anti-SIINFEKL transgenic T cell receptor 36 ), and examined their reactivity by measuring intracellular IFNγ accumulation.

        <p>Following these SIINwEKL experiments, we next sought to examine the cell surface presentation of endogenous peptides with W&gt;F substitutants. First, we searched for these peptides in a published immunopeptidomics dataset of four microsatellite stable colorectal cancer organoids 39 treated or not treated with IFNγ for 48 h. IFNγ treatment did not expand the neoantigen landscape of these organoids 39 ; however, we observed IFNγ-treatment-specific induction of W&gt;F substitutants (Extended Data Fig. 5h). After filtering (Supplementary Table 8), we observed 41 W&gt;F substitutants across organoids upon IFNγ treatment, as opposed to only 4 in control conditions (Extended Data Fig. 5h). By contrast, a search for W&gt;Y, W&gt;N and W&gt;A, substitutions revealed no detectable peptides (Extended Data Fig. 5h). The variability in the identified W&gt;F substitutant peptides across organoids can be explained by the diversity of HLA class I molecules expressed in each of them. Of interest, organoids number 4 and 8 have several HLA molecules in common (HLA-A*03:01, HLA-C*04:01 and HLA-C*05:01) and share one W&gt;F substitutant peptide originating from the RPS18 gene (Extended Data Fig. 5h, KIPDfFLNR, where f marks the W&gt;F event). This substitutant reproducibly appeared in all ten biological replicates of these two organoids.

        <p>the same W&gt;F substitutant was observed in the proteomics analysis of melanoma MD55A3 cells after IFNγ treatment (QYKIPDfFLNR; Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a).the same W&gt;F substitutant was observed in the proteomics analysis of melanoma MD55A3 cells after IFNγ treatment (QYKIPDfFLNR; Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a).</p>
        <p>Second, we searched for the appearance of W&gt;F substitutants in the immunopeptidome of the glioblastoma cell line RA, in which we previously detected their enrichment in the proteome following IFNγ treatment (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 2m, Supplementary Table 9). Indeed, specific enrichment of W&gt;F, but not control substitutions, appeared in the immunopeptidome of RA cells following IFNγ treatment (Fig. 4e). The identification of five substitutant epitopes was validated with targeted mass spectrometry analysis where synthetic standard peptides labelled with stable heavy isotopes were spiked into newly generated samples of HLA-bound peptides eluted from RA cells treated with IFNγ (Extended Data Fig. 6). We then tested whether these substitutant epitopes can be immunogenic. On the basis of HLA restriction (RA expresses HLA-A*24:02), we selected 6 substitutant epitopes from the 21 identified peptides and tested whether they can prime naive CD8 + T cells isolated from healthy HLA-A*24:02 + donors 40 . Monocyte-derived dendritic cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals were pulsed with substitutant peptides and co-cultured with autologous naive CD8 + T cells. After co-culture, combinatorial peptide-MHC multimer staining followed by flow cytometry analyses showed T cell reactivity towards the two substitutant KLHL4-and TMBIM6-derived peptides that have been confirmed by the targeted mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6,7). Even though reactivity against wild-type peptides was not tested, these results demonstrate the potential immunogenicity of substitutants.Second, we searched for the appearance of W&gt;F substitutants in the immunopeptidome of the glioblastoma cell line RA, in which we previously detected their enrichment in the proteome following IFNγ treatment (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 2m, Supplementary Table 9).

        <p>In sum, we describe here the presence of substitutants-proteins with site specific codon reassignments that appear following amino acid deprivation (Fig. 4g). Whereas genetic mutations give rise to fixed changes in proteins, substitutants are inducible protein alterations that arise owing to errors at the mRNA translational level. We show that W&gt;F substitutants are produced by tryptophan shortage induced by IFNγ-mediated IDO1 induction, and can be processed and presented by HLA class I at the cell surface, and activate T cells. The appearance of W&gt;F substitutants is enriched in tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues, and is associated with increased immune reactivity and oncogenic signalling. Moreover, IFNγ-induced W&gt;F substitutants add a new layer to the landscape of the immunopeptidome presented on cancer cells. In particular, in contrast to the scarcity of epitopes with amino acid substitutions arising from genetic mutations, a substantial enrichment of W&gt;F substitutants was observed in the immunopeptidome of IFNγ-treated microsatellite stable colorectal cancer organoids. The observation that W&gt;F substitutants are shared across tumours can potentially lead to generic therapeutic strategies as compared with the largely private genetically encoded neoantigenic repertoire. Beyond cancer immunology, we also show that substitutant proteins are constituents of the stable proteome, and indicate that they may affect gene function. In the context of the growing literature on amino acid depletion diets and related disorders [41][42][43][44][45][46][47] (for example, cancer, longevity, stemness, autophagy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease), substitutants may have a profound effect on cell function.In sum, we describe here the presence of substitutants-proteins with site specific codon reassignments that appear following amino acid deprivation (Fig. 4g).

Next, isobaric quantification was next undertaken separately for TMT and iTRAQ datasets with following parameters (bestPSM: TRUE, level: 2, minProb 0.7, ion purity cut-off: 0.5, tolerance: 20 ppm, among other parameters (Supplementary Table 12). Thereafter, FDR filtering was implemented to retain only confident peptides with following parameters (FDR &lt; 0.01, peptideProbability: 0.7, among other parameters (Supplementary Table 12). Thereafter, TMT-integrator 58 was used to integrate isobaric quantification with following parameters (retention time normalization: False, minimum peptide probability on top of FDR filtering (TMT datasets): 0.9, minimum peptide probability on top of FDR filtering (for iTRAQ dataset): 0.5, among other parameters). Substitutant peptides were fetched from the reports of TMT integrator command, and any detected peptide intensity score for a sample normalized to the reference channel above 0 (log scale) was considered as a positive peptide for that sample using a R-
            <rs type="software">script</rs>. R was used to plot density plots as well as Barplots for number of peptide detections (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 3). For all intra-tumour type analysis, a filter for maximum number of samples (vertical lines in Extended Data Fig. 3) was applied to retain peptides with higher specificity in expression. Next, protein expression profiles for each cancer type were downloaded in already analysed format from PDC commons (https://pdc.cancer.gov). PERL scripts were designed to count number of substitutants when a gene is lowly expressed (intensity &lt; 0) or highly expressed (intensity &gt; 0). Gene ontology (GO)-term enrichment analysis was done using ToppGene 61 . Phosphoproteome data was downloaded from PDC commons (https://pdc.cancer.gov), and a similar analysis as to proteome analysis was undertaken using a customized PERL script.
