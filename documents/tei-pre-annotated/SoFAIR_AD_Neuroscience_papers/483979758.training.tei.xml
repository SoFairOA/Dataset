        <p>Small, soluble metabolites not only are essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighbouring cells when released into the extracellular milieu 1-3 . Here we identify the metabolite and neurotransmitter GABA as a candidate signalling molecule synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells. We show that B cell-derived GABA promotes monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages that secrete interleukin-10 and inhibit CD8 + T cell killer function. In mice, B cell deficiency or B cell-specific inactivation of the GABA-generating enzyme GAD67 enhances anti-tumour responses. Our study reveals that, in addition to cytokines and membrane proteins, small metabolites derived from B-lineage cells have immunoregulatory functions, which may be pharmaceutical targets allowing fine-tuning of immune responses.Small, soluble metabolites not only are essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighbouring cells when released into the extracellular milieu 1-3 .

        <p>Lymphocytes are regulated v a variety of receptor interactions with soluble and cell-bound proteins. However, small metabolites derived from immune cells are also abundant in certain tissues, and many may have signalling potential that has yet to be understood. A growing body of research addresses the flux in metabolic products produced and consumed by different immune cells in various stages of differentiation and activation 1-3 . We hypothesized that water-soluble metabolites can serve as environmental cues, and mediate interactions between immune cells.Lymphocytes are regulated v a variety of receptor interactions with soluble and cell-bound proteins.

        <p>Contrasting homeostatic (non-draining, contralateral; cLN) and activated (draining, ipsilateral; iLN) lymph nodes (LNs) were generated from mice using classic foot-pad immunization with ovalbumin (OVA) protein emulsified in complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA), and subjected to non-targeted profiling of water-soluble metabolites (Fig. 1a). Principal-component analysis revealed that a strong metabolic shift separated iLNs from cLNs in wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 1b). Pathway analysis of around 200 metabolites with significantly different abundance between iLNs and cLNs revealed that the alanine, aspartate and glutamate pathway was the strongest metabolic feature differentiating resting and activated immune sites (Fig. 1c). Purine and pyrimidine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also strongly associated with immune activation (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a).Contrasting homeostatic (non-draining, contralateral; cLN) and activated (draining, ipsilateral; iLN) lymph nodes (LNs) were generated from mice using classic foot-pad immunization with ovalbumin (OVA) protein emulsified in complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA), and subjected to non-targeted profiling of water-soluble metabolites (Fig. 1a).

        <p>We assessed the contribution of the main lymphocyte lineages to the metabolic landscape by performing metabolome analyses on activated and resting LNs from immunodeficient mice lacking T cells (Cd3e -/-), B cells (Ighm -/-; referred to hereafter as muMt -/-) or all mature T and B cells (Rag1 -/-). Despite the presence of many pathogen-associated molecules in CFA expected to stimulate pattern recognition receptors on myeloid cell subsets, the iLN profile of Rag1 -/-mice was similar to that of cLNs, suggesting that lymphocyte activation is the dominant factor contributing to the metabolic shift in this acute inflammatory model (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). B cells strongly influenced the immunized LN metabolic landscape, as muMt -/-samples were distinct from their WT and Cd3e -/-counterparts (Fig. 1b). The neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), not previously known to be synthesized by B cells, was identified as the major metabolite upregulated in iLNs in a B cell-dependent manner with respect to both fold change and P value (Fig. 1d). GABA was also detected in resting cLNs from WT and Cd3e -/-mice, at lower levels (Fig. 1e). However, very little GABA could be detected in LNs from either B cell-deficient mice (muMt -/-) or Rag1 -/-mice, indicating that GABA is a signature B cell metabolite, which was confirmed in random forest algorithm analyses (Fig. 1e andWe assessed the contribution of the main lymphocyte lineages to the metabolic landscape by performing metabolome analyses on activated and resting LNs from immunodeficient mice lacking T cells (Cd3e -/-), B cells (Ighm -/-; referred to hereafter as muMt -/-) or all mature T and B cells (Rag1 -/-).

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 1c). Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) confirmed co-localization of GABA and the B cell compartment in iLNs (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In contrast to previous studies 4,5 , we found a positive correlation of plasma GABA levels with disease activity scores and autoantibody titres in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that GABA is indicative of B cell activation in humans (Fig. 1f). Together, the results indicate that GABA synthesis in LNs is enhanced by antigenic stimulation, in a B cell-dependent manner.Extended Data Fig. 1c).

        <p>GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter regulating inter-neuron communication. Outside the brain, GABA has been detected in the gut, spleen, liver and pancreas 6,7 . Quantitative measurements in non-immunized WT mice revealed higher amounts of GABA in peripheral and mucosal LNs than in liver or pancreas, supporting the notion that B cell-enriched lymphoid tissues are important sources of GABA production (Extended Data Fig. 2a). However, aside from pancreatic beta cells, the cellular source of GABA outside neurons remains unknown. Although the GABA precursors glutamine and glutamate were abundant in B cells and myeloid cells, B cells were characterized by an enrichment in GABA, in either resting (contralateral) or activated (ipsilateral) popliteal LNs (Fig. 2a). B cells from bone marrow, spleen, Peyer's patches and IgA + plasma cells from the small intestine lamina propria were also characterized by elevated GABA levels (Fig. 2b). Additionally, GABA and other glutamate metabolism components were relatively more abundant in B cells in non-targeted MS analyses of lymphocytes from mouse LNs or peripheral human blood (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Analysis of two key enzymes that convert glutamate to GABA showed that transcripts encoding glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), but not GAD65, were elevated in both mouse and human B cells compared with T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e), suggesting that glutamate metabolism characterizes B-lineage cells in both species.GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter regulating inter-neuron communication.

        <p>Next, B cells were activated in vitro in the presence of 13 C 5 , 15 N 2 -labelled glutamine, and glutamine catabolism and labelled metabolite distribution were traced in cell lysate or supernatant in reference to stimulated T cells. Tracing indicated that glutamine was readily converted to glutamate and used for energy generation, control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and as a source for carbon and nitrogen for building the biomass in activated B and T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). However, the abundance of labelled intracellular GABA increased in a time-dependent manner almost exclusively in B cells (Fig. 2c). Labelled glutamine-derived GABA was also detected in B cell media 72 h after stimulation, suggesting that GABA is also released from the cell (Fig. 2c). Other modes of B cell activation, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cross-linking the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) with anti-IgM antibody alone, also induced production and secretion of GABA, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 2d). Various modes of stimulation of human tonsil or blood B cells also facilitated the conversion of glutamine to GABA (Fig. 2e) and increased the levels of both intracellular and secreted GABA derived from labelled glutamine (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3c). IMS analysis of tonsil confirmed high glutamine and GABA levels in B cell follicles (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The metabolic profile of in vivo and in vitro antigen-exposed lymphocytes indicated that active glutamine and glutamate metabolism contributes to GABA production and secretion in both mouse and human B cells.Next, B cells were activated in vitro in the presence of 13 C 5 , 15 N 2 -labelled glutamine, and glutamine catabolism and labelled metabolite distribution were traced in cell lysate or supernatant in reference to stimulated T cells.

        <p>We next addressed the effect of GABA on cellular immune responses, using the MC38 colon carcinoma model in which B cells have been shown to inhibit anti-tumour T cell responses through antigen-non-specific mechanisms 8,9 . We confirmed that muMt -/-mice controlled tumour growth better than their WT counterparts (Fig. 3a). However, implantation of a slow-release GABA pellet led to a significant increase in tumour growth in muMt -/-mice compared with mice receiving a placebo (Fig. 3a). muMt -/-tumour tissues were enriched in infiltrating CD8 + T cells with enhanced cytotoxic and inflammatory properties (Fig. 3b,c, and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c), which was suppressed in muMt -/-mice with GABA implants (Fig. 3b,c, and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). This phenotype was confirmed by gene expression analyses showing that upregulation of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) target gene transcripts characterized CD8 + T cells from muMt -/-mice, and was considerably reduced by exogenous GABA treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Exogenous GABA did not change tumour growth in WT mice, suggesting that endogenous GABA production (by B cells, macrophages and possibly tumour cells) saturates the system, and additional GABA cannot further impede T cell responses (Fig. 3a). However, picrotoxin, a prototypic GABA A receptor antagonist, limited tumour growth and enhanced the cytotoxic Neither GABA nor picrotoxin treatment affected the proliferation and viability of MC38 cells in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Together, these results indicate that reduced GABA, or GABA A signalling, enhances cytotoxic T cell responses and anti-tumour immunity, while secretion of GABA conditions the host towards immune tolerance permissive of tumour growth.We next addressed the effect of GABA on cellular immune responses, using the MC38 colon carcinoma model in which B cells have been shown to inhibit anti-tumour T cell responses through antigen-non-specific mechanisms 8,9 .

        <p>Previous studies have shown that peripheral murine and human lymphocytes express functional GABA receptors [10][11][12][13][14] . Engagement of ionotropic GABA A receptor by GABA has been proposed to induce depolarization of membrane potential, leading to inhibition of T cell responses [10][11][12]15 . We examined the effect of the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin on intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, and observed enhanced Ca 2+ mobilization in mouse CD8 + T cells and human Jurkat T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Furthermore, picrotoxin enhanced thapsigargin (TG)-induced store-operated calcium entry in mouse and human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4g). This confirmed that functional GABA A receptors on the surface of T cells modulate a pivotal signalling pathway, confirming previous studies suggesting that GABA may directly inhibit CD8 + T cells 16,17 . Purified naive CD8 + T cells stimulated in the presence of GABA secreted less inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation in the presence of muscimol, a selective GABA A receptor agonist, significantly decreased activation and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). These results indicate that direct signalling via GABA A receptors is one mechanism by which GABA released by activated B cells may influence the functional properties of nearby T cells.Previous studies have shown that peripheral murine and human lymphocytes express functional GABA receptors [10][11][12][13][14] .

        <p>Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to inhibit anti-tumour immune responses 18 . In the MC38 tumour model, macrophage depletion significantly reduced tumour growth in WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b), consistent with previous studies 19,20 . Conversely, depletion of macrophages led to an increase in tumour size in muMt -/-mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b), suggesting that macrophages have distinct immune-regulatory properties in the presence or absence of B cells. The TAM gene transcription profile of muMt -/- mice differed significantly from that of WT mice, but resembled that of WT mice following treatment with exogenous GABA (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Differential gene expression analyses revealed that expression of transcripts related to cytokines, particularly in the TNF signalling pathway, was enhanced in TAMs from placebo-treated muMt -/-mice compared with those of WT mice, and this phenotype was significantly disrupted when muMt -/-mice were supplemented with GABA (Fig. 3f). Upstream regulator analysis highlighted that many target genes of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and interferon-γ (IFNγ) with increased expression in muMt -/-TAMs were also downregulated by GABA supplementation (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Conversely, GABA supplementation in muMt -/-mice enhanced expression of transcripts related to translation, the cell cycle and energy homeostasis such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which were downregulated in TAMs from muMt -/-mice compared with those from WT mice (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5f). GABA A receptor agonists have been shown to diminish the production of inflammatory cytokines by antigen-presenting cells 21 . We found that TAMs isolated from picrotoxin-treated WT mice upregulated expression of transcripts related to calcium signalling and inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ-targeted genes (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 5g). Genes related to translation, the cell cycle and mitochondria and genes targeted by the interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) were downregulated by picrotoxin (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 5g). These results strongly suggest that GABA affects fundamental processes of macrophage physiology and facilitates polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype.

        <p>Because TAMs are mostly derived from monocytes 22,23 , we assessed whether GABA influenced differentiation of mouse and human monocytes into macrophages. GABA added to macrophages differentiated under neutral conditions (M-0) increased cell number, cell viability and expression of folate receptor β (FRβ), which characterizes anti-inflammatory macrophages 24 (Fig. 4a, b, and Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Gene transcripts related to the cell cycle (such as Mki67, Ccnd1 and Myc) and folate metabolism (such as Folr2, Mthfd2 and Dhfr) were upregulated by GABA (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Transcriptome and proteome profiling identified a distinct GABA M-0 signature, characterized by activation of pathways related to energy metabolism such as OXPHOS and PPAR signalling and downregulation of pathways related to neuroinflammation and nitric oxide (NO) and ROS production (Fig. 4c). Indeed, real-time measurements confirmed that GABA conditioning increased macrophage bioenergetics, particularly mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Like GABA, IL-10 has also been shown to elicit anti-inflammatory macrophages by metabolic reprogramming promoting OXPHOS 25 , and is known to be secreted by B cells and IgA + plasma cells 26,27 . We observed that the IL-10 receptor A signalling pathway was upregulated in TAMs from WT mice compared with muMt -/-mice and downregulated in WT mice by picrotoxin (Extended Data Fig. 5d,g). We next investigated how these two immune-regulatory molecules might influence macrophage generation and function. Monocytes were differentiated in the presence or absence of GABA, followed by the addition of IL-10 to cell cultures (hereafter, GABA M-IL-10 and M-IL-10), before transcriptional, bioenergetic and functional analyses (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Most transcripts of cytokines, cytokine receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation pathway molecules were downregulated by GABA pre-treatment, while IL-10 and OXPHOS transcripts were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7h). GABA A receptors were involved in these transcriptomic changes, as the addition of picrotoxin partially reverted the effect of GABA on M-IL-10 cells, including IL-10 transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 7h). Real-time PCR and bioenergetic profiling confirmed that combined GABA and IL-10 increased IL-10 transcription and enhanced mitochondrial respiration, indicating generation of macrophages with anti-inflammatory properties (Extended Data Fig. 7b-d). Indeed, M-IL-10 cells conditioned with GABA or B cells significantly suppressed CD8 + T cell activation in a co-culture assay, reducing granzyme B production and IFNγ and TNF secretion relative to M-IL-10 cells (Extended Data Figs. 7e,f,8). The inhibitory effect was partially dependent on IL-10, as IL-10-blocking antibodies restored granzyme B to control levels, without affecting inflammatory cytokine production (Extended Data Figs. 7e, f, 8). In vivo, the transfer of GABA M-IL-10 cells facilitated MC38 tumour growth compared with controls receiving no cells or M-IL-10 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7g).Because TAMs are mostly derived from monocytes 22,23 , we assessed whether GABA influenced differentiation of mouse and human monocytes into macrophages. GABA added to macrophages differentiated under neutral conditions (M-0) increased cell number, cell viability and expression of folate receptor β (FRβ), which characterizes anti-inflammatory macrophages 24 (Fig. 4a, b, and Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Gene transcripts related to the cell cycle (such as Mki67, Ccnd1 and Myc) and folate metabolism (such as Folr2, Mthfd2 and Dhfr) were upregulated by GABA (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Real-time PCR and bioenergetic profiling confirmed that combined GABA and IL-10 increased IL-10 transcription and enhanced mitochondrial respiration, indicating generation of macrophages with anti-inflammatory properties (Extended Data Fig. 7b-d). Indeed, M-IL-10 cells conditioned with GABA or B cells significantly suppressed CD8 + T cell activation in a co-culture assay, reducing granzyme B production and IFNγ and TNF secretion relative to M-IL-10 cells (Extended Data Figs. 7e,f,8). The inhibitory effect was partially dependent on IL-10, as IL-10-blocking antibodies restored granzyme B to control levels, without affecting inflammatory cytokine production (Extended Data Figs. 7e, f, 8).

        <p>We next asked whether there is a specific convergence of GABA signalling on the TNF signalling pathway. Monocytes isolated from MC38 tumours were differentiated in vitro in the presence of GABA, before stimulation with TNF or IL-1β to induce nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. GABA greatly reduced the nuclear localization of total p65 induced by TNF, while only partially attenuating its translocation induced by IL-1β (Fig. 4e). Together, these results indicate that GABA facilitates differentiation, expansion and survival of macrophages with anti-inflammatory properties.We next asked whether there is a specific convergence of GABA signalling on the TNF signalling pathway. Monocytes isolated from MC38 tumours were differentiated in vitro in the presence of GABA, before stimulation with TNF or IL-1β to induce nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. GABA greatly reduced the nuclear localization of total p65 induced by TNF, while only partially attenuating its translocation induced by IL-1β (Fig. 4e). Together, these results indicate that GABA facilitates differentiation, expansion and survival of macrophages with anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
        <p>We finally asked whether B cell-specific reduction of GABA synthesis is sufficient to restore anti-tumour responses. Mice carrying a loxP-flanked Gad1 gene encoding GAD67 (Gad1 fl/fl ) were crossed to transgenic mice with B cell-specific expression of Cre (Cd79a-cre; referred to hereafter as Mb1-cre) to generate Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/fl mice. Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/fl mice developed normally, and the frequency and number of B cells and their precursors in the bone marrow were similar to those in control Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/+ mice, as were the frequency and number of B and T cell subsets in peripheral lymphoid tissues, the gut and the peritoneal cavity (Extended Data Fig. 9). We confirmed that conditional inactivation of GAD67 in Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/fl mice reduced GABA in B cells to levels similar to those observed in T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/fl mice significantly controlled growth of implanted MC38 tumours compared with Mb1 cre/+ ;Gad1 fl/+ mice (Fig. 4f), with tumour tissues characterized by infiltrating CD8 + T cells with enhanced cytotoxic and inflammatory properties (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 10b).

Small metabolites have great evolutionary potential as communication molecules, as they can be synthesized and secreted much more rapidly, using fewer cellular resources, than components of classical cell signalling pathways mediated by cytoplasmic, membrane-bound or secreted proteins. This research builds on a body of work describing GABA acting on mature immune cells, such as CD4 + T cell effector subsets and haematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. For many of these studies, the source of GABA remained unclear 16,[28][29][30][31][32][33] . We show that GABA is produced and secreted by both mouse and human B cells, and demonstrate that B cell-or plasma cell-derived GABA is a decisive factor regulating macrophage and CD8 + T cell responses and tumour growth in a mouse model of colon cancer. The presence of IgA + plasma cells expressing PD-L1 and IL-10 within the tumour environment has been linked with poor T cell immunity in human prostatic and liver cancers 34,35 . Increased tumour-infiltrating IL-10-producing regulatory B cells also correlated with immune evasion in patients with gastric cancer 36 . We observed little infiltration of tumours by B cells or IgA + plasma cells in the MC38 tumour model, suggesting that B cell conditioning of CD8 + T cells or monocytes in this model may occur upstream, during cell differentiation, migration or priming in the LN. However, in human renal cell tumours heavily infiltrated with B cells and IgA + plasma cells, GABA was almost exclusively detected in B cell and IgA + plasma cell areas (Extended Data Fig. 10c), suggesting that GABA produced in the tumour microenvironment may also regulate T cells and monocytes in some settings, perhaps explaining the poor prognosis for renal cell cancers with high infiltration of B-lineage cells 37 .and generate countless small molecules.

        <p>The fluctuations in metabolite uptake and secretion that accompany cell activation during immune responses appear to influence both nearby cells and immune outcomes in distant organs. Understanding how intracellular metabolite networks extend into the extracellular milieu to mediate interactions between cells may facilitate development of targeted therapeutic approaches to inhibit tumour cell growth while sparing, or even enhancing, cellular immunity to cancer.The fluctuations in metabolite uptake and secretion that accompany cell activation during immune responses appear to influence both nearby cells and immune outcomes in distant organs.

In human study, patients with RA were randomly recruited after informed consent and selected based on the availability of plasma sample, then patients together with symptoms other than RA (stroke, herpes zoster, dementia, cancer, hemodialysis, pneumonia, surgery in a year) and under steroid treatment were removed from the analysis to investigate pure RA effect on metabolites. Since ratio of male and female is 1:5.8 in the subject group, we focused on female to avoid sex bias.Randomization Age and sex matched mice were randomly allocated into experimental groups.
