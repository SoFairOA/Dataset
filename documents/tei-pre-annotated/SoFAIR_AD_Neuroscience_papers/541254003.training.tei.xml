        <p>A common limitation of neuroimaging studies is their small sample sizes. To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences.

        <p>Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and ComBat mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of ComBat substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to randomeffects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing ComBat with mixedeffects mega-analysis, although ComBat still slightly increased the statistical significance. ComBat also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the ComBat harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the ComBat function to attenuate potential effects of site in ENIGMA projects and other multi-siteHere we tested whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power.

        <p>After the early reporting of ventricular enlargement in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) using pneumoencephalography (Huber, 1957), there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies that use imaging techniques to detect brain differences in people with psychiatric disorders. This increase is most evident for studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), probably due to its high resolution and its wide availability around the globe. However, most MRI studies have examined relatively small sample sizes, a limitation that may prevent the detection of true differences (type II errors), and because of the use of liberal thresholds, may even lead to increased detection of false differences (type I errors). Consequently, reports of unreliable, inconsistent and even contradictory results are not uncommon (Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2012).After the early reporting of ventricular enlargement in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) using pneumoencephalography (Huber, 1957), there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies that use imaging techniques to detect brain differences in people with psychiatric disorders.

        <p>Collaborative multi-site initiatives provide an opportunity to assemble larger and more diverse groups of subjects, leading to increased power and findings that may be more representative of the general population. Among these initiatives, the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis; http://enigma.ini.usc.edu) Consortium (Thompson et al., 2014) stands out for including hundreds of groups worldwide and facilitating the sharing of tens of thousands of neuroimages. One great advantage of this consortium is the harmonization of the protocols to pre-process the MRI data, which has decreased the heterogeneity between the sites related to methodological factors. All sites apply the same pre-processing pipelines to obtain thickness and surface area estimates for cortical regions of interest (ROI) and volume estimates for subcortical ROIs; similar harmonized protocols are in use for standardized analysis of diffusion MRI, resting state fMRI and EEG data, as well as various kinds of omics data (GWAS and epigenetic data).Collaborative multi-site initiatives provide an opportunity to assemble larger and more diverse groups of subjects, leading to increased power and findings that may be more representative of the general population.

        <p>However, even though all sites participating in an ENIGMA project apply the same preprocessing protocol, data from different sites still show relevant methodological heterogeneity due to systematic differences in MRI scanning devices and acquisition sequences. Also, prior studies have reported that the results of the 
            <rs type="software">FreeSurfer</rs> segmentation process, for morphometric analysis of MRI, can be affected even by using different 
            <rs type="software">FreeSurfer</rs> versions, workstations or operating systems (Chepkoech et al., 2016;Gronenschild et al., 2012). Most ENIGMA projects address this residual heterogeneity by random-effects meta-analysis (RE-Meta), but estimation and control of heterogeneity in siteaggregated meta-analyses may be suboptimal (Chen and Benedetti, 2017). It is worth noting that a few ENIGMA studies have analyzed shared individual data (rather than siteaggregated statistical data). These "mega-analyses" of individual data considered the "site" as a random factor within a linear mixed-effects model (ME-Mega), and in several cases examined so far, showed higher statistical power than RE-Meta (Boedhoe et al., 2017(Boedhoe et al., , 2018;;Favre et al., 2019;van Rooij et al., 2018) (Table 1).
        </p>
        <p>Here, we tested whether ME-Mega may be further improved using a recently developed method to control for batch effects. Standard ME-Mega assumes that the error terms follow the same normal distribution at all sites, which is rarely the case as sites usually have different error variances. In addition, both RE-Mega and ME-Meta estimate the heterogeneity of each ROI independently, while it is likely that all ROIs share some heterogeneity. One method that overcomes these issues is ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007), a batch adjustment method developed for genomics data. Fortin and colleagues have shown that ComBat mega-analysis (ComBat-Mega) outperformed other methods for removing the effects of site from cortical thickness data obtained using the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline (Tustison et al., 2014) from a moderately small number of different sites (≤7 sites). Specifically, ComBat decreased scan-related heterogeneity and increased statistical power and reproducibility (Fortin et al., 2018). The current study examines whether this harmonization result can be extended to ENIGMA data obtained using a standardized 
            <rs type="software">FreeSurfer</rs> pipeline (Dale et al., 1999;Fischl et al., 1999). Moreover, we did not know whether the use of a larger number of sites could minimize the advantages of ComBat-Mega as compared to ME-Mega. To answer these questions, we analyzed the main structural MRI data from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group using RE-Meta, ME-Mega and ComBat-Mega, and then compared the findings. The RE-Meta of these data have been already published (van Erp et al., 2016(van Erp et al., , 2018;;Wong et al., 2019); in those analyses, individuals with SCZ showed widespread thinner cortex and smaller surface area, as well as smaller hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and accumbens volumes, and larger pallidum and lateral ventricle volumes.
        </p>
        <p>We hypothesized that ComBat-Mega would show improvements over RE-Meta and ME-Mega in detecting differences between groups of individuals with SCZ and healthy controls (CON), with standard errors of these effects scaling by method: Combat-Mega &lt; ME-Mega &lt; RE-Meta. We further provide the R code (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/ combat_for_ENIGMA_sMRI/combat_for_ENIGMA_sMRI.R) for the application of ComBat harmonization for other ENIGMA mega-analyses or other multi-site structural imaging work even if the imaging data are partially missing in some ROIs (the original ComBat function did not accept missing data).We hypothesized that ComBat-Mega would show improvements over RE-Meta and ME-Mega in detecting differences between groups of individuals with SCZ and healthy controls (CON), with standard errors of these effects scaling by method: Combat-Mega &lt; ME-Mega &lt; RE-Meta.

To exemplify the explanation, we will refer to a simple comparison of cortical thickness between groups of individuals with SCZ and CON, after covarying for effects of age and sex, but the concepts are applicable to other measures and statistical contrasts. We also conducted an alternative analysis covarying for age, sex, and intracranial volume (ICV).Before detailing the collection of data and analyses in the present study, we will briefly explain the three methodological approaches.

        <p>This approach benefits from a more robust estimation of α r and β r as it is based on the data from all sites, as well as from a more precise estimation of the heterogeneity. However, it still may have some minor issues. It assumes that the error terms follow the same normal distribution at all sites, which may seldom be the case. We acknowledge that it is possible to create linear mixed-effects models that consider a different variance for each site, but they involve the specification of variance structures for each statistical test, which may substantially complicate the analyses. In addition, the effects of site are estimated independently for each ROI, which may be suboptimal because the effects of site, even if different for each ROI, may still share some commonalities (e.g., an MRI device may yield a better signal contrast than another across the brain).This approach benefits from a more robust estimation of α r and β r as it is based on the data from all sites, as well as from a more precise estimation of the heterogeneity.

        <p>Fortin and colleagues modified the original "combat" function, in the "sva" package for 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (Leek et al., 2019), so that it could be applied to imaging data (Fortin et al., 2017). However, Fortin's "combat" function may not be easily applicable to ENIGMA projects as it requires that the dataset has no missing data, which is seldom the case. In addition, it finds the harmonization parameters and applies them to the data within the same function, while some analyses -such as machine learning -require that the parameters are found in a training set and later applied to an independent test set (this is not the case here, but it might be the case in future studies). We further modified the "combat" function to allow for missing data and to separate the fitting and the application of the harmonization.
        </p>
        <p>First, we divided the function into two subfunctions: "combat_fit", which finds the harmonization parameters, and "combat_apply", which applies them to the same or to another set. The "combat_fit" function automatically imputes missing data so that the function can find the harmonization parameters without errors. These imputations are predictions based on linear models of the ROI values by the covariates, separately for each ROI and each site:First, we divided the function into two subfunctions: "combat_fit", which finds the harmonization parameters, and "combat_apply", which applies them to the same or to another set.

The researchers at each of the sites had collected the data after obtaining participants' written informed consent, with protocols that had been approved by local institutional review boards.

Note that the ComBat functions use covariates (e.g., age and sex) to better estimate the effects of site, but they do not remove the effects of these covariates; for this reason, we included these covariates in the subsequent linear model.

        <p>To show the differences in statistical significance between methods expected by chance, we plotted the histogram of the median difference in the logit-transformed p-values between the methods across the permutations (Fig. 1). For example, in one permutation we randomly assigned study participants to patient or control status. We then compared these randomly assigned patients and controls using RE-Meta, ME-Mega and ComBat-Mega. We then calculated differences between logit-transformed p-values of the ComBat-Mega comparison and logit-transformed p-values of the RE-Meta (or ME-Mega) comparisons for each ROI.To show the differences in statistical significance between methods expected by chance, we plotted the histogram of the median difference in the logit-transformed p-values between the methods across the permutations (Fig. 1).

        <p>From these, we only saved the median between logit-transformed p-value difference. Note that this median difference should be very close to zero, given that participant assignment was random, and there should therefore be no patient-control group differences other than by chance. By conducting multiple of these permutations, we were able plot the histogram of the median differences expected by chance alone. Finally, we compared the median difference of the original analysis (with correctly assigned patient and control status) with the histogram of the median differences expected by chance. Only median differences were used in this analysis to simplify the test as doing so avoids the need to correct for multiple comparisons.From these, we only saved the median between logit-transformed p-value difference.

        <p>We must note that without the logit (or other) transforms, the detection of differences in statistical significance would be too sensitive for large p-values and too little sensitive for small p-values. For example, if the (non-transformed) p-value using one approach was 0.6 and the (non-transformed) p-value using another approach was 0.4, the difference in pvalues would be very large (0.6-0.4 = 0.2) even if the two p-values might be considered conceptually very similar, whereas if the (non-transformed) p-value using one approach was 0.003 and the (non-transformed) p-value using another approach was 0.001, the difference in p-values would be very small (0.003-0.001 = 0.002) even if one p-value is three times the size of the other. With the logit transform, the p-values of the first example would be 0.4 and -0.4, with a difference of 0.8, and the p-values of the second example would be -5.8 and -6.9, with a difference of 1.1.We must note that without the logit (or other) transforms, the detection of differences in statistical significance would be too sensitive for large p-values and too little sensitive for small p-values.

        <p>We also tested whether ComBat-Mega increases the statistical power using a small-subset strategy. Specifically, we repeated 500 times the analyses but including each time only a random sample of 10 sites.

We only used ROIs in which the differences between SCZ and CON were strongly statistically significant in the main analyses using the 33 sites (FWER&lt;0.001 for RE-Meta, for ME-Mega, and for ComBat-Mega), as we assumed that they have true differences. Finally, we conducted a Wilcoxon signed-ranked test to compare the statistical power across ROIs between ComBat-Mega and RE-Meta, as well as between ComBat-Mega and ME-Mega.We also tested whether ComBat-Mega increases the statistical power using a small-subset strategy.

        <p>In this study, we analyzed individual subject level data pooled by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group using three methods to account for the effects of site: random-effects meta-analysis (RE-Meta), linear mixed-effects models (ME-Mega), and ComBat harmonization followed by standard linear models (ComBat-Mega). The results of the comparison between SCZ and CON using ComBat-Mega were similar to the studies already published by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group: SCZ showed a widespread thinner cortex and smaller surface area (van Erp et al., 2018), smaller hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and accumbens, and larger lateral ventricles, putamen and pallidum (van Erp et al., 2016) than CON. The results of the same comparison using RE-Meta and ME-Mega were in the same direction and had similar effect sizes, although with a lower statistical significance (i.e. wider confidence intervals, larger p-values), especially for RE-Meta. In other words, the use of ComBat increased the statistical significance (i.e., narrower confidence intervals, smaller p-values) of the differences between SCZ and CON. This was specially apparent in those ROIs in which intra-site variance was only ~50-70% of total variance. ComBat Mega also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. All approaches controlled well the FWER, even too strictly probably due to the use of the Holm method, which is more powerful than the Bonferroni method but still conservative (Blakesley et al., 2009). Findings were similar when covarying by ICV.In this study, we analyzed individual subject level data pooled by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group using three methods to account for the effects of site: random-effects meta-analysis (RE-Meta), linear mixed-effects models (ME-Mega), and ComBat harmonization followed by standard linear models (ComBat-Mega).

        <p>Based on these findings, we recommend that ENIGMA mega-analysis projects consider applying the ComBat function to reduce the effects of site, followed by standard statistical analysis without including site as a fixed or random effect in the statistical model. To apply ComBat harmonization, we provide easy-to-use functions for R that work even if there are missing data and they can be trained with data from one set and then applied to data from another.Based on these findings, we recommend that ENIGMA mega-analysis projects consider applying the ComBat function to reduce the effects of site, followed by standard statistical analysis without including site as a fixed or random effect in the statistical model.

        <p>We must note that we conducted these analyses with the three main types of data used in ENIGMA projects: thickness of cortical ROIs, surface area of cortical ROIs, and volumes of subcortical nuclei. However, some ENIGMA projects use other types of data, such as mean fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts, and we have not explored whether the application of ComBat would be beneficial for these projects. Two notions suggest that ComBat should be broadly beneficial. On the one hand, the ComBat algorithm is not specific for a given type of imaging data. Indeed, while it was developed for genomics data (Johnson et al., 2007), we here successfully applied it to three types of ENIGMA imaging data. Moreover, Fortin and colleagues found that ComBat outperforms other harmonization methods for voxel-based fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (Fortin et al., 2017), and Yu et al. found similar results for resting-state functional connectivity and network measures (Yu et al., 2018).We must note that we conducted these analyses with the three main types of data used in ENIGMA projects: thickness of cortical ROIs, surface area of cortical ROIs, and volumes of subcortical nuclei.

        <p>While our findings suggest that ComBat harmonization will be useful for most ENIGMA mega-analyses and other multi-site structural imaging work, we suggest caution when combining different types of data. We conducted a single ComBat harmonization for different types of MRI data because we considered that thickness, area, and volume are related, as they are obtained from the same 
            <rs type="software">FreeSurfer</rs> output of the T1-weighted image and all measure amounts of gray matter. Indeed, an alternative analysis with separate ComBat harmonization for each type of data yielded nearly identical results. However, we do not know whether the application of a single ComBat harmonization on other combinations of data would behave similarly.

        <p>Other popular approaches for pooling neuroimaging data are the voxel-based meta-analytic methods, such as Seed-based d Mapping (SDM) (Albajes-Eizagirre et al., 2019;Radua et al., 2012) or Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) (Eickhoff et al., 2009(Eickhoff et al., , 2012)). These methods can include imaging studies even if they only report the coordinates of the peaks of the clusters of statistical significance. Therefore, a great advantage of these methods is the exhaustive inclusion of studies. In addition, the analyses are conducted at the voxel level (rather than using ROIs). These methods traditionally tested whether the reported findings tended to converge in a few brain voxels (Albaje-s-Eizagirre and Radua, 2018), but novel methods are able to directly test whether there are differences -even if they are widespread and do not converge (Albaje-s-Eizagirre et al., 2019). In view of the results of the present study, one could wonder whether these voxel-based methods should also conduct ComBat mega-analysis instead of meta-analysis. However, to use ComBat they would need access to individual subject level data, which at present are often not available. Another aspect to consider is whether we need SDM or ALE meta-analyses after an ENIGMA ComBat megaanalysis is published. Here, we must remember that SDM and ALE are voxel-based and include virtually all published studies, whereas most ENIGMA studies are ROI-based and include only the data that authors agree to share.

        <p>Our study has some limitations. First, we already stated that we have not explored whether the application of ComBat would be beneficial for projects using other types of data, although several facts suggest that ComBat should be broadly beneficial. Second, we also acknowledged that we do not know whether the application of a single ComBat harmonization on other combinations of data would behave similarly. Third, our analysis is focused on the differences between SCZ and CON, whose distribution is roughly similar across sites. The effects of site and thus the importance of their removal might be larger for conditions with few cases in each site, where pooling data is more beneficial. Fourth, ComBat-Mega addresses some issues but not others, which still need to be investigated, such as site by nuisance confounds. For example, a site with poor quality data may also be a site with a mean age higher than other sites. Future studies addressing these questions could point to methods other than ComBat. Finally, there is a conceptual difference in the effects of site that are modeled in ComBat/ME-Mega and the effects of site that are modeled in RE-Meta. The former effects are in (individual) raw data and refer to site-specific constants that are added to or that multiply the measurements. The latter effects, conversely, are in (group) effect sizes, and are probably a mix of several factors such as site-specific constants that multiply the measurements, heterogeneity in the differences between SCZ and CON, or differences in precision between studies.Our study has some limitations.

        <p>To conclude, this paper provides evidence of the superiority of ComBat harmonization over standard mega-analyses and meta-analyses in reducing site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We therefore recommend that ENIGMA mega-analysis projects and other multi-site structural imaging work consider applying the ComBat function, which we provide employing easy functions for R. The provided code works with missing data and allows for harmonization of a test set based on the training set (a requirement for machine learning and possibly replication studies).
