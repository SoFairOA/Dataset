        <p>Nowadays, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) with non-uniformly distributed patterns has created unprecedented challenges for regional power systems to maintain system flexibility and reliability. These technical challenges obligate power system operators to curtail part of the produced renewable energy at various scheduling intervals. Motivated by these challenges, grid-connected energy hubs are seen as a way forward to boost system flexibility, decrease the rate of renewable power curtailment, and increase energy efficiency. However, simplified models may significantly affect the performance of the grid-connected energy hubs in practice. Hence, this paper proposes a holistic structure to determine the optimal coordinated operation of the grid-connected energy hubs and the regional power system by relying on the high penetration of wind power. In this regard, various fundamental challenges that have not yet been addressed in an integrated manner, including the CO 2 emission rate and the amount of curtailed renewable energy along with total operating costs of the integrated energy system, are among the main objectives of the optimization problem. The proposed structure is developed in the form of tractable mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to handle the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). The information-gap decision theory (IGDT)-based robust model is used for accurate modeling of wind power uncertainty. The characteristics of the proposed IGDT-based robust SCUC model and its benefits are investigated through several technical case studies conducted on the modified 6-bus and 24-bus test systems. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed structure. According to the obtained results for the 6-bus test system, networked energy hubs can help the system operator to reduce the total operating cost, wind power curtailment cost, and CO 2 emission cost by 16.62%, 100%, and 30.44%, respectively, through utilizing up-to-date energy conversion facilities and energy storage systems as well as managing energy demands. It can be seen that the proposed strategy is a very effective step towards achieving a 100% renewable energy system.Nowadays, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) with non-uniformly distributed patterns has created unprecedented challenges for regional power systems to maintain system flexibility and reliability.

        <p>Over the last decades, the electricity industry has undergone major changes in various sectors due to a number of structural, technical, and economic factors. Heightened concerns about nuclear power plants, energy prices, climate changes, and reliability requirements have led countries to increase the penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the bulk power systems (Li et al. (2020)). Among the RESs, wind units have attracted more attention and had the fastest growth around the world (Kong et al. (2018); Oskouei &amp; Yazdankhah (2015)). At the end of 2019, the worldwide installed capacity of wind power reached 651 GW. The share of leading countries in the field of renewable energy, such as China, the United States, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil in the global wind power capacity was equal to 33%, 16.08%, 9.89%, 5.86%, 3.46%, and 2.42%, respectively (GWEC (2019)).Over the last decades, the electricity industry has undergone major changes in various sectors due to a number of structural, technical, and economic factors.

        <p>From an environmental perspective, expansion planning of bulk power systems under high penetration of RESs brings many benefits to society. Perhaps the most prominent point is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Behboodi et al. (2017)). Nevertheless, due to the aging of power grids infrastructure and non-uniformly distributed renewable sources, the use of the high-power intermittent RESs brings some technical challenges to the regional power system, such as line congestion (Chen et al. (2018)) and power balance violation (Deng &amp; Lv (2020)). Because of these challenges, the control and protection systems may be obligated to reduce or curtail a large amount of generated renewable power. According to published statistics, at the end of 2019, the wind power curtailment was almost equal to 17.38 TWh in the power system worldwide (IEA ( 2019)). In addition, the power system operators have to pay high compensation costs to wind farm owners to curtail wind power. It can be observed that the existing power system structure is not suitable for hosting the high-penetration of RESs. Therefore, immediate actions supplemented with studies related to reducing power spillage of RESs are necessary today to prevent the waste of renewable energies.From an environmental perspective, expansion planning of bulk power systems under high penetration of RESs brings many benefits to society.

        <p>Research works included in this category analyzed the power grid in onedimensional mode and the presented methods were focused solely on the sustainable performance of the bulk power system. The main approach governing this category was based on the use of optimal scheduling strategies for power grids operation in coordination with various technical tools, such as energy storage systems and demand response programs (DRPs). In addition, the power grids constraints were identified as a critical factor in advancing the objectives of these works. For instance, in (Wang et al. (2019a)), a multi-objective security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem was established with the aim of analyzing the relationship between the rate of wind power curtailment and the system's operation cost. Furthermore, the developed scheduling model considered the impacts of utilizing energy storage systems and load shedding options on the power system operation process. In (Khaloie et al. (2020)), a scenario-based stochastic model was developed to optimally allocate energy storage systems in active power grids. The utilized structure aimed to harvest the maximum possible wind power by relying on the capabilities of the energy storage systems. A two-stage method was presented in (Dui et al. (2018)) by considering the role of thermal units, wind farms, and energy storage systems in the operation of power systems. In the first stage, the unit commitment (UC) problem was solved to determine the optimal scheduling of the generation units by relying on AC power flow constraints. The second stage identified the appropriate operational strategy for energy storage systems. Authors of (Oskouei &amp; Yazdankhah (2017)) suggested a promoted load shifting technique to maximize the utilization of RESs by considering the frequency-based pricing mechanism and pump-storage hydro plant. Moreover, in (Wang et al. (2018)), the energy management strategy was proposed for the optimal operation of microgrids based on the stochastic programming approach considering the high penetration of RESs. The utilized model in this work was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model and simulation results demonstrated that this model could reduce the power curtailment rate of RESs up to 12% and the total operational costs up to 17% compared to the initial state. In (Xie et al. (2018)), a multi-objective structure was used to achieve an optimal scheme of the bulk power system considering the high penetration of RESs. In (Xie et al.

        <p>The studies included in this category made a step further by considering interdependency in a multi-vector energy community to alleviate or overcome the negative consequences of the integration of high-power RESs in power grids. The key requirements for upgrading the current power grid to the multidimensional mode were analyzed in these studies. In this regard, the energy hub system as an emerging concept in the context of the integrated multi-carrier energy systems was widely welcomed (Xie et al. (2020b)). Grid-connected energy hubs have a great potential for widespread integration of RESs as distributed means of generation to increase the energy efficiency and flexibility of the integrated energy systems (Dini et al. (2019)) as well as to reduce the waste of energy (Abdollahi &amp; Lahdelma (2020)). These systems link independent natural gas and electricity networks at the subtransmission and distribution levels and then optimize them as an integrated system by relying on the energy conversion facilities such as combined heat and power (CHP), gas boiler (GB), and energy storage systems (Mohammadi et al. (2017)).The studies included in this category made a step further by considering interdependency in a multi-vector energy community to alleviate or overcome the negative consequences of the integration of high-power RESs in power grids.

        <p>As stated in the literature, the optimization of the power grids operation in the presence of RESs, which follow the energy hub strategy was attracted much attention by the energy research community. Authors of (Eladl et al. (2020)) proposed a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the overall costs of multiple energy hub systems. The uncertainties of both wind and photovoltaic systems were modeled by a scenario-based approach. Further, the effectiveness of energy storage systems to reduce wasted renewable energy was investigated and the overall energy losses were reduced up to 4% by the proposed method. In (Liang &amp; Tang (2020)), the interval optimization framework was developed based on the UC problem and contingency issue in transmission lines to integrate power and natural gas networks with high penetration of wind power. The energy conversion facilities were utilized to reduce renewable power curtailment and provide auxiliary services for the power system operator. Authors of (Li et al. (2019)) introduced a decentral optimization framework to specify the optimal dispatch of the grid-connected energy hubs in the framework of the hierarchical structure with a particular emphasis on RESs.

        <p>This paper proposes an IGDT-based robust SCUC approach for the optimal exploitation of the regional power system in the presence of grid-connected energy hubs and high-power wind farms. Establishing an appropriate connection between the regional power systems and energy hub systems enables operators to utilize the capacity of other energy systems such as the natural gas network in addition to the power grid infrastructure. This mechanism creates many economic opportunities for the power system operator in energy markets and helps the operator to reduce wind power curtailment, increase the system flexibility, and fulfill its obligations at the lowest operating cost. The framework of the proposed structure is shown in Fig. 1. Since the proposed structure is drawn up from the perspective of the regional power system, the power system operator is responsible for the optimal exploitation of the integrated energy system. The integrated energy system consists of thermal units, wind farms, and large-scale energy hubs. In the integrated energy system, the regional power system operator uses the ability of the grid-connected energy hubs like a multi-carrier energy generation/storage unit. Hence, the cost of energy exchanged between grid-connected energy hubs and the regional power system is not considered in the mathematical formulation.This paper proposes an IGDT-based robust SCUC approach for the optimal exploitation of the regional power system in the presence of grid-connected energy hubs and high-power wind farms.

It should be noted that in the proposed structure, despite accurate modeling of the regional power system and energy hubs' equipment, dynamic modeling of natural gas and district heating networks were ignored. However, the concept of gas and heat energy flow was considered on buses where the energy hubs were connected to the regional power system.As shown in Fig. 1, the input ports of energy hubs are connected to the natural gas network and regional power system.

On the contrary, the average LMPs were increased at the initial intervals of the scheduling program in cases 2 and 3 compared to case 1. The reason for this was that the energy storage systems were charged in these intervals.

Therefore, the energy hub systems, which were equipped with up-to-date facilities, in coordination with multi-energy DRP can be considered as the best approach to reduce renewable power curtailment. Furthermore, the economic impacts of the use of promoted energy hub systems as well as multi-energy DRP on the total operating cost of the integrated energy system are given in Table 6. In case 1, the costs of CO 2 emission and wind power curtailment were very high compared to other cases, so the operating cost of the integrated energy system had the highest amount in this case study. The impact of coordinated scheduling of the regional power system and grid-connected energy hubs on the average LMPs is also shown in Fig. 24. According to this figure, although by utilizing P2H in case 2, the average LMPs were increased during periods 5-14, these amounts were decreased significantly during periods 16-24. Likewise, utilization of the multi-energy DRP in case 3 reduced the LMPs during the hours between 8 and 24.All case studies previously defined for the modified 6-bus test system were also included in this test system. Fig. 23 shows the wind power curtailment for each case study in the framework of the modified 24bus test system.

        <p>This paper proposed a developed IGDT-based robust scheduling strategy for optimal coordination of the grid-connected energy hubs with the regional power grid in the framework of the integrated energy systems under high penetration of wind power generation. The main focus of this article was to design and implement a holistic day-ahead scheduling program to simultaneously minimize integrated energy system operational costs, wind power curtailment, and carbon emissions. In addition, the participation of multi-energy consumers in integrated energy system management was investigated through the concept of multi-energy DRP to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in decreasing operational costs. Two well-known standard test systems were considered to analyze the performance of the proposed strategy. The robustness of the proposed strategy was tested through several case studies. Simulation results indicated that the coordinated operation of the regional power system and promoted energy hub systems using the proposed strategy was very effective in increasing the degree of freedom in decisionmaking as well as achieving the intended goals. Numerical results in the 6-bus test system showed that using up-to-date energy conversion facilities such as P2H storage can reduce the total operation cost by up to 6.7%. The results also showed that the total operation cost could be further decreased by up to 16.62% by implementing multi-energy DRP. From an environmental point of view, the technical results show that the use of the P2H storage in coordination with multi-energy DRP was provided the required conditions for 100% utilization of the installed wind farms. Further, the CO 2 emissions cost was $114,455.12 in case 3 that was the lowest amount of case studies and was about 69.9% of its corresponding amount of the first case study. Meanwhile, the impact of the wind power uncertainty on the results was analyzed through the IGDT-based robust approach.This paper proposed a developed IGDT-based robust scheduling strategy for optimal coordination of the grid-connected energy hubs with the regional power grid in the framework of the integrated energy systems under high penetration of wind power generation.
