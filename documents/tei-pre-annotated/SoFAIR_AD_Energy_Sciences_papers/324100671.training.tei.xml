        <p>The increasing demand for powerful electronic devices have a high requirement on effective cooling solutions capable of dissipating heat sufficiently. This is especially challenging to existing facilities with the current trend of miniaturization. Thus, effective electronic cooling is in urgent demand. Thermal energy storage with phase change materials (PCMs) can absorb and release thermal energy for peak-load shifting as well as reducing the system capacity [1]. This type of energy storage unit has been adopted in electronic cooling and ventilation applications [2] [3]. With phase change materials, a significant temperature reduction in the operating temperature of electronic devices can be achieved, which significantly improves their performance and enhances stability [4]. However, the low thermal conductivity limits the application of phase change materials [5] [6].</p>
        <p>The recent reports focused on using heat pipes to enhance the heat transfer performance [7]. Table 1 shows the reported cooling method using PCMs coupled with heat pipes in electronic cooling. In addition, heat pipe-based cooling system was also used in thermal management of battery energy storage [12], which was considered as a promising solution [13]. [8] RT-42</p>
        <p>Copper-water Variable Numerical study Weng et al. (2011) [1] Tricosane Copper-water Variable Experimental study Krishna et al. (2017) [9] Tricosane/ Al 2 O Copper-water Variable Experimental study Zhao et al. (2016) [10] Paraffin Copper-water Variable Experimental study Qu et al. (2015) [11] Paraffin Copper-water Variable Experimental study An oscillating heat pipe (OHP) is an effective thermal transmission device, which has a great potential for the application in electronic cooling. The oscillating heat pipe, also called pulsating heat pipe, was first introduced by Akachi [14] in the 1990s. A typical OHP is an interconnected capillary tube with many turns that is partially filled with a working fluid [15]. During the operation, continuous condensation (in the condenser) and evaporation (in the evaporator) of the working fluid produce a pressure difference that drives the fluid motion in the channel; liquid plugs and vapor slugs are alternately distributed along the pipe [16]. Compared with the traditional heat pipe, the OHP is a passive heat transfer device that exhibits several unique operating features such as high heat transport capability and manufacturing flexibility. The oscillating heat pipe has been used and studied widely [17] [18].</p>
        <p>The two-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (2D-OHP) is a device that is commonly applied in many fields because of its simple structure, flexible operation, and good applicability. However, the heat transmission direction of the 2D-OHP is limited to a flat plane. The mounting direction also limits the utilization of the 2D-OHP. The three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (3D-OHP) was designed for highly integrated electronic components to enhance the thermal management. It involves more heat transmission directions than the 2D-OHP. It also improves the temperature distribution of the electronics, making it more uniform.</p>
        <p>The thermal performance of 3D-OHP has been investigated in several previous studies. Qu et al. [19] demonstrated that the start-up temperature and thermal resistance of the 3D-OHP depended on the cooling air velocities and operating orientation. Ma et al. [20] proposed several flat-plate 3D-OHPs and tested the temperature oscillations and thermal resistance under different conditions. A multi-layered Ti-6Al-4V OHP (ML-OHP) was designed by Ibrahim [21] and was experimental studied to characterize its thermal performance under different conditions. The results indicated that the ML-OHP can be effectively operated while being filled with several working fluids and was almost independent of the operation orientation and gravity. Thompson et al. [22] investigated the performance of flat-plate 3D-OHPs. They reported that the amplitude of temperature oscillations depended on the heating width, operating orientation, and working fluid properties.</p>
        <p>The flow structure of natural systems may provide ideas for the design of new types of 3D-OHPs. Bejan et al. [23] published a book about the design in nature as a scientific discipline. They focused on discovering a physics law for the design in nature. The branching networks had been investigated by several researchers to study the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Rubio-Jimenez et al. [24] designed flow channel structures for heat sinks. They demonstrated that -shaped configurations resulted in a reduced thermal resistance and more Ψ uniform surface temperatures, compared with Y-shaped structures. Zhang et al. [25] studied the thermal and flow behaviors of bifurcations and bends in fractal-like microchannel networks. The results indicated that the pressure drop and heat transfer performance depended on the aspect ratio. Xu et al. [26] numerically investigated the flow and thermal performance of several tree-shaped microchannel networks with and without loops. They reported that tree-shaped nets with loops improved the performance of the electronic cooling system. Convective heat transfer is important for devices with a branching structure. Luo et al. [27] provided a theoretical expression to calculate the convective heat transfer rate and reported that symmetrical branches resulted in a large heat transfer rate when the trunk diameter was larger than 0.004 m. Nayak et al. [28] also performed a three-dimensional numerical simulation to investigate the pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient in a Y-shaped branch pipe with a 60° branch angle. Zheng et al. [29] studied the solidification behavior in the heat exchanger with different fin configurations and found that the tree-shaped fins has significant influence on the enhancement of the PCM solidification.</p>
        <p>The above literature review shows that the thermal performance of three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (3D-OHPs) was studied under different conditions. However, the optimal structure design was seldom reported. The structural design of branching networks for electronics cooling has drawn much attention, while it has never been applied on the 3D-OHPs. With the inspiration of leaf shapes, this paper proposes a leaf-shaped three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (LSOHPs) for improving heat transfer performance. Further, the LSOHP is embedded into phase change materials to cool down electronic devices. Experimental study is conducted with various working parameters and significant temperature decreases on the surface temperature of electronic devices are observed, indicating efficient electronic cooling.</p>
        <p>In this study, typical three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (3D-OHPs) were designed, fabricated, and tested in the laboratory. The OHPs were fabricated using red copper. The height of a 3D-OHP was 180mm. The length and width of a 3D-OHP with 8 turns were both 90 mm. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the geometry of the 3D-OHPs and the points measured during the test. Deionized water was used as the working fluid; the filling ratio (FR) was changed from 24% to 54%. (1) where Bo is the bond number, r is the hydraulic radius of the pipe, is the density of the liquid, is the density of the vapor, is the surface tension, and is the gravitational acceleration. Taft et al. [30] reported that a value of 0.85 can be used to calculate the maximum hydraulic radius of an OHP. The rearrangement of Eq. (1) shows that the maximum radius of the microchannel embedded in an OHP system is:</p>
        <p>(2) The limit of the pipe diameter can be defined using Eq. (2). In this study, copper tubes charged with deionized water were fabricated. At 20°C， the maximum diameter of the 3D-OHP was 5.46 mm. The inner diameter of 3 mm and outer diameter of 5 mm were bent in a U-shape in this study.</p>
        <p>The thermal performance including the temperature variations and thermal resistances of the 3D-OHPs under different working conditions were analyzed in detail.</p>
        <p>The OHP was tested under heating powers in the range of 25 to 100 W. The thermal resistance can be defined by Eqs.(3)- (5). The parameters and are the mean temperatures of the evaporation and 𝑇 𝑒 𝑇 𝑐 condensation sections [°C], respectively:</p>
        <p>  where i is the index number of the measurement point. The temperature was measured using K-type thermocouples with a reading accuracy of ±0.75%.</p>
        <p>A leaf-shaped 3D-OHP (LSOHP) was designed. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the LSOHP. The height of the LSOHP was 180 mm. The length (L) and width (W) of the LSOHP with 8 turns were 150 and 85 mm, respectively. Deionized water was used as the working fluid; the filling ratio was 44%. The constructal law was defined to design the LSOHP. As shown in Fig. 3 a), the transform angle ( ) was 𝑎 𝑡 . The evaporation section of a LSOHP has eight turns, which were defined as the evaporation branches. To 45°1 describe the design, a sketch of the virtual branches is shown in Fig. 3 b). Combined with the virtual branches, the top view of the LSOHP is shaped like a piece of a leaf. According to the constructal law of a LSOHP, three structural parameters were used: the transform angle , number of the evaporation branches , and number of a t Ψ e the condensation branches . The values of the parameters are shown in Table 2. The 3D-OHP unit was tested in a controlled laboratory environment with a multipurpose air-cooling system. The ventilation mode and laboratory environment were controlled by the control cabinet. To control the ventilation mode, the control switch was adjusted; the obtained air distribution is shown in Fig. 4. The cooling air was supplied to the heat-retaining room by the duct in the ceiling plenum. After cooling of the OHP system, the air was returned from the ceiling plenum to the cooling system. The width and height of the air supply pipe were 600 and 150mm, respectively. The cooling air was controlled by the control cabinet and external fan with a specified temperature of 20°C.</p>
        <p>Fig. 5 illustrates the experimental apparatus of the OHP unit. Charensawan and Terdtoon reported that the thermal resistance depends on the evaporator length section. Decreasing the evaporator length improves the thermal performance for all cases of used tube diameters, FRs, and working fluids [31]. In this study, the lengths of the evaporation and condensation sections of the proposed 3D-OHPs were 50 and 60 mm, respectively. The temperature oscillation was studied in detail by deploying a single OHP unit into a thermal isolation box along with the heating elements. The box was filled with a glass wool insulation layer. The evaporation section of the 3D-OHP was wrapped with resistance heating wires. The heating power was controlled in the range of 25 to 100 W by adjusting the voltage transformer. The condensation section of the 3D-OHP was cooled by the air-cooling system. In this study, the unit of phase change materials embedded with three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (PCM/OHP) was designed to cool the electronic component simulator. The PCM/OHP unit consists of an aluminum heating platform, a copper case, and the paraffin wax along with the 3D-OHP. Fig. 8 illustrates the experimental apparatus of the PCM/3D-OHP unit. The length and width of the copper case were 92 and 92mm, respectively. The evaporation section of the 3D-OHP was inserted into the paraffin wax filled in the copper case and heated by the aluminum heating platform placed under the bottom of the case. The condensation section of the OHP is cooled by the air-cooling system in the insulated room. The main thermo-physical parameters of the paraffin wax were shown in Table 3. The aluminum heating platform was selected as the electronic component simulator. The heating power can be adjusted in the controller and the base temperature can be displayed in the monitor. 9 was adjusted to cool the PCM/3D-OHP unit in a controlled laboratory environment. The cooling air was supplied by the plenum to the heat-retaining room and drawn into the cabinet simulator by the AC frequency fan. After cooling of the PCM/OHP unit placed in the room, the air was returned from the ceiling plenum to the cooling system. The cooling air temperature was 22°C.</p>

        <p>The temperature variations of the proposed three-dimensional oscillating heat pipes (3D-OHPs) were studied experimentally at heating powers ranging from 25 to 100 W. The temperatures of the evaporation and condensation sections were monitored and recorded. 3.1 Thermal performance of the three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe 3.1.1 Effect of the filling ratio on the 3D-OHP Fig. 11 shows the oscillating temperature curves of the proposed 3D-OHPs. The oscillating temperature curves clearly indicate two periods. When the heating power is relatively low, no oscillation is observed. As the heating power increases, the heat flux by evaporation occurring at the liquid-vapor interface increases and the vapor volume variation acts as a spring in the system. The slug/plug flow formed and a thin layer of liquid film placed on the surface. As a result, the temperature oscillation presents a large fluctuation associated with an occasionally large amplitude and low frequency. The heating power at which a notable temperature oscillation can be observed was defined as the start-up power. The results show that the start-up power depends on the FR. When the FR is 34%, the start-up power is the lowest. This indicates that less power is required to initiate oscillations. When the FRs are decreased to 24% or increased to 54%, the start-up power significantly increases. This indicates that different FRs correspond to different thermally excited oscillating motions. At a FR ranging from 34% to 44%, a small heating power is required to initiate oscillations. At FRs beyond this range, more heat is required to generate an oscillating motion in the 3D-OHP.</p>
        <p>3D-OHP (34%) 3D-OHP (44%) 3D-OHP (54%)</p>
        <p>Figure 11 Temperature oscillations of the 3D-OHPs at different FRs We assume that the heating power is constant (without any loss), the low temperature of the evaporation section indicates that the heat is rejected effectively. Therefore, the temperature of the evaporation section should be small enough to ensure that the electronic components work in the recommended range. The temperature variations of the 3D-OHPs under different FRs in the evaporation section are depicted in Fig. 12. At Journal Pre-proof a high heating power in the range of 75 to 100W, the 3D-OHP with a FR of 34% exhibits the lowest temperature and the 3D-OHP with a FR of 44% exhibits the second lowest temperature. Because hot spots mostly occur when the electronic components are operated at a high heating power, a FR in the range of 34% to 44% is recommended to achieve a better cooling performance.</p>
        <p>Temperature variations of the 3D-OHPs at different FRs in the evaporation section Fig. 13 illustrates the thermal resistance of the 3D-OHPs at different heating powers depending on different FRs. In general, the thermal resistance decreases with increasing heating power. At a low heating power, the thermal resistance slowly decreases or even increases before it decreases. The inflection point is probably due to thin film evaporation phenomena. As the heating input increases, the slug/plug flow forms and a thin layer of liquid film develops on the surface. The thermal-excited oscillating motion is generated in the capillary tube, which significantly improves the forced convection in addition to the phase change heat transfer. Based on the results of 3D-OHPs charged with deionized water at different FRs, the thermal resistance presents a divergent trend when the heat input is relatively small (e.g., 50W). When the heat input is higher than 50W, the ≤ 3D-OHP with a FR in the range of 34% to 44% exhibits the lowest thermal resistance.</p>
        <p>Thermal resistance of the 3D-OHPs at different FRs The above-mentioned analysis shows that 3D-OHPs with filling ratios in the recommended range of 34% to 44% achieve the best thermal performance.</p>
        <p>Fig. 14 shows the temperature curves of the 3D-OHP with a FR of 44% at different cooling air velocities. When the cooling air velocity increases from 5 to 8m/s, the temperatures of the evaporation and condensation sections notably decrease, which is probably due to the enhancement of the convective heat transfer. Figure 14 Temperature variations of the 3D-OHPs at different cooling air velocities When the 3D-OHP is vertically placed, the cooling air is supplied from different directions. We consider the 3D-OHP as a tube bundle and neglect the effect of turns. As shown in Fig. 6 a), for the 3D-OHP in aligned arrangement, the Zhukauskas equation was used to calculate the Nusselt number ( ), i.e., Re = 10 3 -2 × 10 5 𝑁𝑢 = 𝜀 𝑛 0.27𝑅𝑒 0.63 𝑃𝑟 f 0.36 (𝑃𝑟 f /𝑃𝑟 w ) 0.25 (9) where is the correction factor for the tube bundle. The correction factor was set to 0.910 in this case. The ε n convective heat transfer coefficient can be determined as follows:</p>
        <p>where is the heat conductivity and d is the outer diameter of the pipe. The convective heat transfer λ coefficients of the 3D-OHPs are 121. 4 and 163.3 when the velocities of the cooling air are 5 and W/(m 2 • K) 8m/s, respectively. The convective heat transfer coefficient increases with the increase of cooling air velocity. The temperatures of the condensation section decrease due to the enhancement of convective heat transfer.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. 13, the thermal resistance at different cooling velocities show the same trend. And the difference between thermal resistance at different cooling velocities was small. The result demonstrated that the temperature of the evaporation section decreased with the increase of cooling air velocity. With respect to electronics cooling, we consider that the temperature of the evaporation section is one of the most important factors influencing the cooling performance. A high cooling air velocity benefits the cooling performance. However, increasing the cooling air velocity is accompanied by the increase in the energy consumption. An optimal trade-off between the cooling air velocity and temperature of the evaporation section should be made to ensure that the electronic components operate in the recommended temperature range with less energy consumption.</p>
        <p>Thermal resistance of the 3D-OHPs at different cooling air velocities</p>
        <p>Fig. 6 shows the schematic of the 3D-OHP at different wind directions. Fig. 6a shows the flow of cooling air through the 3D-OHP in aligned arrangement; in this case, Eqs( 9) and ( 10) can be adopted to calculate the For the 3D-OHP in staggered arrangement shown in Fig. 16, the cooling air flowing through the curved passage alternately contracts and expands between the tubes. Therefore, the disturbance during the flow process is stronger than the cooling air flowing through the tube bundle in aligned arrangement, which leads to an enhanced heat exchange. Thus, the convective heat transfer coefficient of the 3D-OHP in staggered arrangement should be larger than the convective heat transfer coefficient of the 3D-OHP in aligned arrangement.</p>
        <p>Air flow through the 3D-OHP in staggered arrangement Fig. 17 shows that the 3D-OHP with side flow exhibits a lower evaporation temperature. This indicates that the temperature of the evaporation section decreases with increasing convective heat transfer coefficient. The thermal resistance has little change with different wind directions (Fig. 18). Journal Pre-proof</p>
        <p>Figure 18 Thermal resistance of the 3D-OHPs at different wind directions The combined study of the temperature variation and thermal resistance indicates that the cooling performance of the 3D-OHP depends on the wind direction. The 3D-OHP in staggered arrangement exhibits a better cooling performance.</p>
        <p>The above-mentioned analysis has proven that a filling ratio in the range of 34% to 44% leads to the best thermal performance. The 3D-OHP in staggered arrangement exhibits a better cooling performance. We assume that the flow structures found in natural systems may provide ideas for the design of new types of 3D-OHPs with better cooling performances. Therefore, we designed a leaf-shaped three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (LSOHP), which has a complex structure. A LSOHP with a filling ratio of 44% was designed to study the influence of the structure on the cooling performance (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Fig. 19 shows the oscillating temperature curves of the proposed LSOHP. The oscillating temperature curves show that the start-up power was 50W. The start-up power was constant at different wind directions.</p>
        <p>where is the correction factor for the tube bundle. The correction factor was set to 0.928 and 0.965 for side ε n and forward flow, respectively.</p>
        <p>Eqs (10) and ( 11) were adopted to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficients. The convective heat transfer coefficients of the LSOHP were 132 and 137. 3 when the wind directions were side and W/(m 2 • K) forward flow, respectively. Therefore, the temperature in the evaporation and condensation sections decrease with increasing convective heat transfer coefficient. The thermal resistance at different wind directions are approximately equal at a high heat input.</p>
        <p>When the cooling air velocity was constant, the comparison between the temperature variations of the LSOHP and 3D-OHP shows that the LSOHP exhibits a lower temperature in the evaporation section. This indicates that the LSOHP has a better cooling performance than the typically used 3D-OHP.</p>
        <p>Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 show the temperature variations and thermal resistance of the LSOHP. Eqs (10) and (11) were adopted to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficients. The convective heat transfer coefficients of the 3D-OHP are 132 and 170. 3 when the cooling air velocities are 5 and 8m/s, respectively. The W/(m 2 • K) results illustrate that the higher the convective heat transfer coefficient is, the lower is the temperature in the evaporation and condensation sections. 20 and22, the temperature difference between the evaporation sections of the LSOHP at different wind directions is much smaller than the temperature difference between the evaporation sections of the LSOHP at different cooling air velocities. This is probably due to the varying convective heat transfer coefficient differences. When the convective heat transfer coefficient difference increases, the temperature difference between the evaporation sections increases.</p>
        <p>The phase change materials embedded with three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (PCM/3D-OHP) is tested to study the cooling performance for electronic devices. The thermal resistance model is developed for the PCM/3D-OHP unit. The thermal resistance model is shown in Fig. 24.</p>

        <p>Fig. 26 shows the thermal images of PCM/3D-OHP unit at different wind directions.

The equilibrium temperature of the electronic component simulator is 1 lower than that of the PCM/3D-OHP unit with forward flow arragement. ℃ According to the average temperature provided in the thermal images, was stay unchanged when the ∆𝑇 PCM wind direction changed from forward flow to side flow. It indicated that the thermal conducitvity of the PCM can not be enhanced by the 3D-OHP at different wind directions. Then the improvement of cooling performance was probably due to the heat transfer performance enhancement in the condensation section. The calculated cooling efficiency was shown in Table 4. The results indicated that the cooling efficiency was slightly improved by using PCM/3D-OHP unit with side flow arragement.</p>

        <p>Effective electronic cooling is a big challenge with the increasing demand for high-throughput computing of data centres as well as the fast development of battery energy storage. The current air cooling technology is not only energy-intensive but also difficult to cool down the electronic devices. In this paper, an effective cooling technology is proposed for electronic devices by embedding three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (3D-OHP) into phase change materials (PCMs). The PCMs are used to store the dissipated heat from electronic devices and the 3D-OHP to quickly transport the stored heat to the environment. Experimental study is conducted on the 3D-OHP to optimize its structure with various working parameters such as the cooling air velocity, wind direction and heat input. The cooling performance of PCMs embedded with the 3D-OHP for electronic devices is also investigated in terms of temperature variations and thermal resistance. The main conclusions are shown as follows.</p>
        <p>1) The proposed cooling method can control the surface temperature of electronic devices well below 100 o C, while the conventional air cooling method can only cool the surface temperature to 135 o C with the same working conditions. Therefore, it is an effective cooling method by using phase change materials (PCMs) embedded with three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe (3D-OHP) for electronic devices. What's more, with the proposed cooling method, thermal resistance by transferring heat to the environment is reduced up to 36.3%.</p>
        <p>2) A leaf-shaped structure is designed based on the flow structure found in nature for the three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe. With the same cooling air velocity and wind direction, the leaf-shaped structure contributes to a 2 o C lower surface temperature on the electronic devices, compared with the typical structure. Thus, the leaf-shaped structure is suggested for the three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe.</p>
        <p>3) The operation parameters of the proposed cooling method are optimized. It is found that the three-dimensional oscillating heat pipe achieves the best thermal performance when the filling ratio is in the range of 34-44%. The thermal performance also depends on the cooling air velocity and wind direction. A large cooling air velocity results in a large convective heat transfer coefficient as well as a decrease in the temperature of the evaporation and condensation sections.</p>
