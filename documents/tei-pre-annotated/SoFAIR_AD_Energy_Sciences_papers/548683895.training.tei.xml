        <p>Global energy demand and consumption are always on the rise due to an increase in population and standards of living, apart from the industrial growth of developing countries (Ibrahim, 2012;Mostafa et al., 2019). Inductively the global primary energy supply was 14,410 MTOE in 2019(IEA, 2019a). According to the International energy agency's prediction, the global energy demand will be increased by 50% in 2030 (EIA, 2016). To date, more than 95% of this huge energy demand is fulfilled by using fossil fuels, however, the use of fossil fuels releases a high concentration of greenhouse gas emissions consequently increasing the global warming and environmental pollution (Sazal, 2020;Lee et al., 2018). Therefore, the rapid development of alternative green energy technologies is essential to meet global energy demands and sustainable development. In this context, the 'Paris Agreement' was framed and approved by 196 parties at the 21st conference of the parties (COP 21) in 2015, which aims to respond to the global warming actively by preventing a global temperature rise below 1.5 • C (Jacquet and Jamieson, 2016). In addition, many countries have focused on introducing environmentally friendly energy policies for a sustainable environment and decarbonization. For example, South Korea announced the 2nd Climate Change Response Master Plan in 2019 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 709.1 million tons in 2017 to 536 million tons by 2030 for a sustainable and low-carbon green society (Lee et al., 2020). Thus, globally various research institutions/organizations have moved towards the development of innovative technologies that can utilize renewable sources for generating green energy and fuels. Hydrogen is one such promising environmentally friendly renewable energy carrier and it is the most abundant element in the universe (Immanuel and Dmitri, 2018;Pinsky et al., 2020;Dawood et al., 2020). The hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron, making it the lightest element in the universe, and having unique properties like high energy density (120 MJ/kg) and lower volumetric energy density (8 MJ/L). However, it is not readily available directly on the earth, it is available in chemically combined forms of water, fossil fuels, and biomass. Hence the main challenge is to separate hydrogen from the naturally occurring compounds efficiently and economically.Global energy demand and consumption are always on the rise due to an increase in population and standards of living, apart from the industrial growth of developing countries (Ibrahim, 2012;Mostafa et al., 2019).

        <p>Hydrogen can be produced from various sources of raw materials including renewable and non-renewable sources which are around 87 million tons/year (Dawood et al., 2020;Milani et al., 2020). However, as of 2020, most of the hydrogen (95%) was produced from non-renewable fossil fuels especially steam reforming of natural gas, emitting 830 million tons/year of CO 2 and the rest of the hydrogen was produced from renewable resources including water electrolysis (Mosca et al., 2020;IEA, 2019b). The major hydrogen production methods and their applications are as shown in Fig. 1.Hydrogen can be produced from various sources of raw materials including renewable and non-renewable sources which are around 87 million tons/year (Dawood et al., 2020;Milani et al., 2020).

        <p>Hydrogen is classified into different color shades i.e., blue, gray, brown, black, and green respectively based on their hydrogen production technology, energy source, and environmental impact (Noussan et al., 2021;Ajanovic et al., 2022), as shown in Table 1. The blue hydrogen is produced from the steam reforming of natural gas. During this process, natural gas is split into hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the produced CO 2 is captured (85%-95%) and stored underground using industrial carbon capture and storage techniques and some of the generated CO 2 cannot be captured. In addition, long-term impacts of storage are uncertain, and leakage can still negatively affect the environment and climate (Hermesmann and Muller, 2022;Navas-Anguita et al., 2021). The gray hydrogen is produced from non-renewable fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal by steam reforming/auto-thermal reforming process, this process is similar to the blue hydrogen process, but the produced CO 2 is not being captured, it is directly released into the atmosphere (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Brown hydrogen is most abundant in use today, which is produced from hydrocarbon-rich feedstock (brown coal or methane) via the gasification process. But as a result, every tone of brown hydrogen releases 10-12 tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere. The black hydrogen is produced from coal gasification, during this coal gasification process syngas are produced from the gasifier and the hydrogen can be separated from the other gases using absorbers or special membranes and the remaining gases can be released into the atmosphere (IRENA, 2020a;IEA, 2019b). Green hydrogen is produced from renewable water and electricity by electrolysis process, in this process water is split into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) under the influence of electricity with zero carbon emissions (Carmo et al., 2013).Hydrogen is classified into different color shades i.e., blue, gray, brown, black, and green respectively based on their hydrogen production technology, energy source, and environmental impact (Noussan et al., 2021;Ajanovic et al., 2022), as shown in Table 1.

        <p>In the transition towards global decarbonization, nowadays renewable-powered green hydrogen generation is one way that is increasingly being considered as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution (Yue et al., 2021;Burton et al., 2021). Hence, there is an increasing interest to make the production and utilization of this green hydrogen more scalable and versatile process. Water electrolysis is a key technology for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by using renewable energy (solar, wind) (Ibrahim, 2012;Burton et al., 2021). Solar and wind energies are prepared and well suitable renewable power sources for hydrogen production through water electrolysis due to their widespread power distribution (Wang et al., 2014). The combination of renewable energy with water electrolysis is particularly more advantageous because surplus electrical energy can be stored chemically in the form of hydrogen to balance the discrepancy between energy demand and production (Brauns and Thomas, 2020). Further, the produced hydrogen and oxygen can be directly used for the transportation and industrial sector as primary energy sources. Hydrogen is not only a primary energy source it is an energy carrier that can be directly used in fuel cell vehicles and the industrial sector.

        <p>Past two centuries, water electrolysis is a well-known technology for green hydrogen production. However, globally only 4% of hydrogen (65 million tons) can be produced from water electrolysis due to economic issues, with most of this hydrogen being produced as a by-product from the Chlor-alkali industry (Yu et al., 2018;Hall et al., 2020;Yodwong et al., 2020).

        <p>Alkaline water electrolysis is well established mature technology for industrial hydrogen production up to the multi-megawatt range in commercial applications across the globe (Kuckshinrichs et al., 2017). The alkaline water electrolysis phenomenon was first introduced by Troostwijk and Diemann in the year 1789. After several developments in the year of 1939, the first industrial large-scale alkaline water electrolyzer plant with the capacity of 10,000 N m 3 H 2 h -1 went into operation (Diogo et al., 2013). In later early 19th century, more than 400 industrial alkaline electrolyzer units were successfully installed and operated for industrial applications (Grigoriev et al., 2020). However, the alkaline water electrolyzer operates at lower temperatures (30-80 • C) with a concentrated alkaline solution (5M KOH/NaOH). Moreover, in alkaline water electrolyzer nickel (Ni) coated stainless steel electrodes and asbestos/ZrO 2 -based diaphragms are used as a separator (Shiva Kumar et al., 2018a,b,c,d, 2017). The ionic charge carrier is hydroxyl ion (OH -) with KOH/NaOH and water permeating through the porous structure of the diaphragm to provide the functionality of the electrochemical reaction (Shiva Kumar et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2021a). The alkaline water electrolysis is a favorable system design for large-scale applications. Today, the investment cost of alkaline water electrolysis is USD 500-1000/kW, and the lifetime of the system is 90,000 h (Bertuccioli et al., 2014a,b;Schmidt et al., 2017). However, the major challenge associated with alkaline water electrolysis is limited current densities (0.1-0.5 A/cm 2 ) due to moderate OH -mobility, and usage of corrosive (KOH) electrolytes (IRENA, 2020a). Due to the high sensitivity of the KOH electrolyte to ambient CO 2 and the subsequent salt formation of K 2 CO 3 , the resulting decrease in the number of hydroxyl ions and ionic conductivity. In addition, the salt of K 2 CO 3 close the pores of the anode gas diffusion layer which subsequently decreases the ion transferability through the diaphragm and consequent reduction of hydrogen production. Apart from that, the alkaline water electrolysis produces low purity (99.9%) of gasses (Hydrogen and Oxygen) due to the existing diaphragm does not completely prevent the crossover of the gases from one half-cell to the other.Alkaline water electrolysis is well established mature technology for industrial hydrogen production up to the multi-megawatt range in commercial applications across the globe (Kuckshinrichs et al., 2017).

        <p>Alkaline water electrolysis is an electrochemical water splitting techniques in the presence of electricity. The electrochemical water splitting consists of two individual half-cell reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. During the alkaline electrolysis process, initially at the cathode side two moles of alkaline solution are reduced to produce one mole of hydrogen (H 2 ) and two moles of hydroxyl ions (OH -), the produced H 2 can be eliminated from the cathodic surface and the remaining hydroxyl ions (OH -) are transferred under the influence of electric circuit between anode and cathode through the porous separator to the anode side. At the anode, the hydroxyl ions (OH -) are discharged to produce the 1 /2 molecule of oxygen (O 2 ) and one molecule of water (H 2 O), as shown in Fig. 3.Alkaline water electrolysis is an electrochemical water splitting techniques in the presence of electricity.

        <p>Alkaline water electrolysis is a mature and well-established technology up to the multi-megawatt scale and globally number of manufacturers are successfully deployed and used for industrial applications (IRENA, 2020b;IEA, 2021), some of the commercial alkaline water electrolyzers and their manufacturers are listed in Table 4. However, some improvements are still needed in this technology such as increase in the current density and reduce the crossover of the gasses. To achieve these challenges, new electrode materials and separators need to be developed. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer can be integrated with renewable energy (solar, wind) sources which can be more beneficial for reducing the capital cost. In this direction, some of the research institutes/organizations are still actively working on increasing the efficiency and reducing hydrogen production cost. For example, Liu et al. (2020) reported heterojunction hybrid structures of MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S as a low-cost and noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER in alkaline media. The developed MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S-1 electrocatalyst exhibited a significantly lower overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm -2 towards the HER and OER overpotential of 182 mV at 10 mA cm -2 with the highest HER and OER activity. Additionally, achieved a lower cell voltage of 1.86 V for the overall water splitting and demonstrated superior stability during the continuous operation of 15 h. This improvement is mainly due to strong integration between ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets with non-stoichiometric Ni 0.96 S nanocrystals, exposure of more active sites, and presence of abundant heterojunction interfaces within MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S-1h. Qazi et al. ( 2021) developed an efficient bifunctional nano heterostructure electrocatalyst of NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF for overall water splitting and studied their performance in 1M KOH solution. As prepared NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF electrocatalyst has shown improved electrochemical performance towards the HER and OER in alkaline media with a lower overpotential of 133 and 327 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm 2 with a small Tafel slope of 119 and 118 mV dec -1 for HER and OER respectively. In addition, experimentally studied their performance through single-cell electrolysis process using NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. The results showed better electrochemical performance than the other non-noble metal electrocatalysts, the attained cell voltage of 1.69 V to reach the current density ≥10 mA cm -2 . Further, the developed electrocatalyst was stable during the continuous electrolysis process of 12 h in a strong alkaline solution due to the robust mechanical adhesion between NiCo-NiCoO 2 nanoparticles. The better performance was achieved by the small size of NiCo-NiCoO 2 nano heterostructures uniformly distributed on the oxidized surface of copper foam enabling them to maximum utilization active sites during the electrochemical reactions. Xu et al. (2022) developed a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of 2D metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived NiCoP nanoflakes (NiCo (nf) -P) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. The developed electrocatalyst performance were studied by threeelectrode cell assembly with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method at the potential cycling rate of 2 mV s -1 in a 1M KOH electrolyte solution. The developed NiCo (nf) -P was shown better electrocatalytic activity with a lower onset potential of 37 mV and 1.435 V than commercial 5% Pt/C (43 mV) and IrO 2 (1.504 V) at the current density of 100 mV cm -2 towards the HER and OER. In addition, NiCo (nf) -P was shown lower overpotential of 119 mV and 315 mV than commercial 5% Pt/C (291 mV) and IrO 2 (400) to achieve the current density of 100 mV cm -2 towards the HER and OER. The Tafel slope also potentially lower for NiCo (nf) -P (112 mV dec -1 ) and 66 mV dec -1 than commercial 5% Pt/C (164 mV dec -1 ) and IrO 2 (88 mV dec -1 ), which indicates the rapid charge transfer across the electrocatalytic interfaces of as developed NiCo (nf) -P. Further, the developed NiCo (nf) -P electrocatalyst stability studies were carried out at different current densities of 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm -2 towards the HER and OER using chronopotentiometric (V-t) measurements. The, attained results show the stable electrochemical performance during the 30 h of continuous operation, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the developed NiCo (nf) -P electrocatalyst HER and OER performance also were studied in alkaline electrolyzer, it shows the excellent electrocatalytic activity with a lower cell voltage of 1.94 V at the operating current density of 1 A cm -2 .Alkaline water electrolysis is a mature and well-established technology up to the multi-megawatt scale and globally number of manufacturers are successfully deployed and used for industrial applications (IRENA, 2020b;IEA, 2021), some of the commercial alkaline water electrolyzers and their manufacturers are listed in Table 4. However, some improvements are still needed in this technology such as increase in the current density and reduce the crossover of the gasses. To achieve these challenges, new electrode materials and separators need to be developed. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer can be integrated with renewable energy (solar, wind) sources which can be more beneficial for reducing the capital cost. In this direction, some of the research institutes/organizations are still actively working on increasing the efficiency and reducing hydrogen production cost. For example, Liu et al. (2020) reported heterojunction hybrid structures of MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S as a low-cost and noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER in alkaline media. The developed MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S-1 electrocatalyst exhibited a significantly lower overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm -2 towards the HER and OER overpotential of 182 mV at 10 mA cm -2 with the highest HER and OER activity. Additionally, achieved a lower cell voltage of 1.86 V for the overall water splitting and demonstrated superior stability during the continuous operation of 15 h. This improvement is mainly due to strong integration between ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets with non-stoichiometric Ni 0.96 S nanocrystals, exposure of more active sites, and presence of abundant heterojunction interfaces within MoS 2 @Ni 0.96 S-1h. Qazi et al. ( 2021) developed an efficient bifunctional nano heterostructure electrocatalyst of NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF for overall water splitting and studied their performance in 1M KOH solution. As prepared NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF electrocatalyst has shown improved electrochemical performance towards the HER and OER in alkaline media with a lower overpotential of 133 and 327 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm 2 with a small Tafel slope of 119 and 118 mV dec -1 for HER and OER respectively. In addition, experimentally studied their performance through single-cell electrolysis process using NiCo-NiCoO 2 @Cu 2 O@CF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. The results showed better electrochemical performance than the other non-noble metal electrocatalysts, the attained cell voltage of 1.69 V to reach the current density ≥10 mA cm -2 . Further, the developed electrocatalyst was stable during the continuous electrolysis process of 12 h in a strong alkaline solution due to the robust mechanical adhesion between NiCo-NiCoO 2 nanoparticles. The better performance was achieved by the small size of NiCo-NiCoO 2 nano heterostructures uniformly distributed on the oxidized surface of copper foam enabling them to maximum utilization active sites during the electrochemical reactions. Xu et al. (2022) developed a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of 2D metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived NiCoP nanoflakes (NiCo (nf) -P) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. The developed electrocatalyst performance were studied by threeelectrode cell assembly with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method at the potential cycling rate of 2 mV s -1 in a 1M KOH electrolyte solution. The developed NiCo (nf) -P was shown better electrocatalytic activity with a lower onset potential of 37 mV and 1.435 V than commercial 5% Pt/C (43 mV) and IrO 2 (1.504 V) at the current density of 100 mV cm -2 towards the HER and OER. In addition, NiCo (nf) -P was shown lower overpotential of 119 mV and 315 mV than commercial 5% Pt/C (291 mV) and IrO 2 (400) to achieve the current density of 100 mV cm -2 towards the HER and OER. The Tafel slope also potentially lower for NiCo (nf) -P (112 mV dec -1 ) and 66 mV dec -1 than commercial 5% Pt/C (164 mV dec -1 ) and IrO 2 (88 mV dec -1 ), which indicates the rapid charge transfer across the electrocatalytic interfaces of as developed NiCo (nf) -P. Further, the developed NiCo (nf) -P electrocatalyst stability studies were carried out at different current densities of 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm -2 towards the HER and OER using chronopotentiometric (V-t) measurements. The, attained results show the stable electrochemical performance during the 30 h of continuous operation, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the developed NiCo (nf) -P electrocatalyst HER and OER performance also were studied in alkaline electrolyzer, it shows the excellent electrocatalytic activity with a lower cell voltage of 1.94 V at the operating current density of 1 A cm -2 .</p>

In addition, shown superior stability during the 3000 cycles of CV tests and only 20 mV shifting can be at the current density of 100 mA cm -2 . In addition, water dissociation (∆G * H 2 O ) and hydrogen adsorption (∆G * H ) energies were calculated by DFT (density functional theory) for different materials. According to the DFT calculations, the prepared CPN@TC has strongest binding energy of -0.822 eV, which is favorable for the HER reactions.

AEM water electrolysis offers several advantages such as cost-effective transition metal catalysts being used instead of noble metal catalysts, distilled water/low concentrated alkaline solution (1M KOH) can be used as electrolyte instead of high concentrated (5 KOH solution) (Henkensmeier et al., 2021).

        <p>AEM water electrolysis is one of the electrochemical water splitting techniques with the help of an anion exchange membrane and electricity. The electrochemical reaction consists of two half-cell reactions they are hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Initially, at the cathode side, the water molecule is reduced to generate hydrogen (H 2 ) and hydroxyl ions (OH -) by the addition of two electrons. The hydrogen is released from the surface of cathode and the hydroxyl ions (OH -) are diffused through the ion exchange membrane to the anode side by the positive attraction of the anode, while the electrons are transported through the external circuit to the anode. At the anode side, the hydroxyl ions recombine as a water molecules and oxygen by losing electrons. The produced oxygen is released from the anode.

Globally, several research organizations/institutions are actively working on the development of AEM water electrolyzers, some of the AEM water electrolyzer manufacturers/developers are listed in Table 4. However, several innovations/improvements are still needed to scale up this technology for commercial applications. The major challenges are limited stability (at present 35,000 h and targeted stability of 1,00,000 h) and high hydrogen production cost, present hydrogen production cost is USD 1279 kW/H 2 (2020), and the targeted cost reduction of USD ≤ 300 kW/H 2 (2050) (Ionomr, 2020). To achieve these targets, the existing challenges need to be addressed economically to commercialize for market applications. In this direction, Thangavel et al. (2021) developed a 3D oxygen evolution electrode via electrochemical integration of amorphous NiFeOOH on activated carbon fiber paper (CFP) by single-step co-electrodeposition techniques and their performance in 1M KOH solution.

This enhancement is due to the unique 3D structures with increased active sites and the enhanced electrical conductivity that helps enhance the OER kinetics and mass transport properties. In addition, Fe-doping plays a key role in enhanced OER activity of 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP. Additionally, the developed 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode OER activity was studied in a single-cell alkaline AEM water electrolyzer with ultra-pure water and compared with commercial IrO 2 electrodes under similar experimental conditions. Impressively, the developed 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance to commercial IrO 2 electrodes, the attained cell voltage of 1.88 V than commercial IrO 2 2.08 V at an operating current density of 1 A/cm 2 with ∼80% energy efficiency. Furthermore, long-term stability is studied at constant voltage of 20.V for 240 h continuously where the prepared 3Da-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode exhibited stability retention of 95.6% with ultra-low degradation rate of 0.15 mA h -1 and the Faradaic efficiency of 98.5%.

The ionic charge carrier is H + and DI water permeating through the proton-conducting membrane it provides the functionality of the electrochemical reaction. Typically, PEM water electrolysis operates at lower temperatures (30-80 • C) with higher current densities (1-2 A/cm 2 ) and produces high purity (99.999%) of gases (Hydrogen and Oxygen) (Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019a). Because the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction in PEM water electrolysis is faster than alkaline water electrolysis due to the highly active area of the metal surface of Pt electrodes and lower pH of the electrolyte. In addition, PEM water electrolysis is safer than alkaline water electrolysis due to the absence of caustic electrolytes and smaller footprint. Therefore, globally several water electrolyzer manufacturers (listed in Table 4) are developed large-scale (up to MW) PEM water electrolyzers for industrial and transportation applications.

        <p>During the PEM water electrolysis process, water is electrochemically split into hydrogen and oxygen. In this process, initially at the anode side water molecule is decomposed to generate oxygen (O 2 ) and protons (H + ), and electrons (e -). The generated oxygen eliminated from the anodic surface and the remaining protons are traveled through the proton-conducting membrane to the cathode side and the electrons are traveled through the external circuit to the cathode side. At the cathode side, the protons and electrons recombined to produce H 2 gas. The basic principle of PEM water electrolysis is shown in Fig. 9.During the PEM water electrolysis process, water is electrochemically split into hydrogen and oxygen.

The generated oxygen eliminated from the anodic surface and the remaining protons are traveled through the proton-conducting membrane to the cathode side and the electrons are traveled through the external circuit to the cathode side. At the cathode side, the protons and electrons recombined to produce H 2 gas. The basic principle of PEM water electrolysis is shown in Fig. 9.</p>
        <p>The PEM water electrolysis cell major components are membrane electrode assembly (consist of membrane and anode, cathode electrode materials), Gas diffusion layer, separator plates (bipolar plates), and end plates respectively (Shiva Kumar et al., 2018c;Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019a;Upadhyay et al., 2020Upadhyay et al., , 2022)) , 2021). The porous titanium/titanium mesh and carbon cloth are used as anode and cathode gas diffusion layers. Different flow field designed bipolar plates made up of titanium material coated with platinum/gold are used as separators and endplates respectively. Among different flow field designs, the straight parallel flow field designed separator plates have shown better performance, especially in PEM water electrolyzer (Yang et al., 2019). However, these separator plates are expensive and are responsible for 48% of the overall cell cost (IRENA, 2020b). Therefore, the cost-effective cell components i.e., electrode materials and separator plates still under challenge.The PEM water electrolysis cell major components are membrane electrode assembly (consist of membrane and anode, cathode electrode materials), Gas diffusion layer, separator plates (bipolar plates), and end plates respectively (Shiva Kumar et al., 2018c;Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019a;Upadhyay et al., 2020Upadhyay et al., , 2022)) , 2021).

        <p>PEM water electrolysis technology is well developed and commercially available up to megawatt (MW) for industrial and transportation applications, some of the large-scale PEM electrolyzer manufacturers are listed in Table 4. However, several improvements are still required to reduce the hydrogen production cost, the present hydrogen production cost is USD 700-1400 kW/H 2 (2020), and targeted cost reduction is USD ≤ 200 kW/H 2 (2050) (IRENA, 2020b). To achieve this target, the existing challenges need to be addressed such as replacement/reduction of platinum group metals with cost-effective transition metals, removing the expensive coatings on bipolar plates, and redesigning the new bipolar plates with cost-effective materials. Moreover, to reduce the membrane thickness and enhance the cell efficiency. Currently, the Nafion ® 117 (thickness 180 µm) membrane is using in PEM water electrolyzers, the efficiency loss from this membrane is 25% (at 2 A/cm 2 ), if reducing the thickness as low as 20 µm the predicted reduction efficiency losses is 6% (at 2 A/cm 2 ). Therefore, in this direction several researchers from public and private organizations are still working on their developments especially focusing on cost reduction. For example, Xie et al. (2021) reported integrated electrode architectures to consist of platinum nanowires on ultrathin titanium gas diffusion layers for hydrogen evolution reaction in PEM water electrolysis. The ultrathin titanium integrated PtNW electrode (PtNW/Ti) showed a lower overpotential of 63 mV at the higher current density of 100 mA cm -2 with a smaller Tafel slope of 35 mV dec -1 . Further, electrochemical performances were studied in PEM water electrolyzer as a cathode electrode, the attained results demonstrated that the PtNW/Ti electrode has showed a lower cell voltage of 1.643 V at 1 A cm -2 and high efficiency of 90.08% with 15 times lower catalyst loadings than conventional MEAs in PEM water electrolysis. Also, Xie et al. (2022) developed ionomerfree integrated electrodes (1T-2H MoS 2 NS/CFP) using engineered 1T-2H heterophase with MoS 2 nanosheets (MoS 2 NSs) by in-situ growing on carbon fiber paper with MoS 2 loading of only 0.14 mg/cm 2 for HER and studied their performance in 0.5M H 2 SO 4 as well as in PEM water electrolyzer. The integrated electrode has shown outstanding performance with an extremely lower overpotential of 192 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 44 mV dec -1 . Further, the PEM water electrolyzer results exhibited that, the integrated electrode impressively achieved a cell voltage of 2.25 V at an operating current density of 2 A/cm 2 , as shown in Fig. 10. Furthermore, the integrated electrode performance was compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts with similar metal loading of 2.0 mg/cm 2 . The commercial Pt/C catalyst exhibited a lower cell voltage of 2.18 V than that of the integrated 1T-2H MoS 2 NS/CFP electrode (2.25 V) at the current density of 2 A cm -2 but this performance is superior to reported non-noble catalysts. Jang et al. (2020a,b) introduced a novel titanium-doped molybdenum phosphide (Ti-MoP) electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acid electrolyte. The developed Ti-MoP electrocatalyst demonstrated superior electrochemical performance than undoped MoP with an overpotential of only 81.5 mV at 10 mA cm -2 than that of undoped MoP (93.5 mV) under the acidic electrolyte (0.5M H 2 SO 4 ), indicating that the HER performance is improved approximately 13% by doping Ti with MoP. The Tafel slope also shows that Ti-MoP has a lower (44.5 mV dec -1 ) than that of undoped (MoP 46.3 mV dec -1 ). Further, the electrochemical stability was studied for 8000 cycles and 15 days for undoped MoP and Ti-doped MoP, the Ti-doped MoP electrocatalyst exhibited improved stability in 0.5M H 2 SO 4 solution. Yoon et al. ( 2021) developed a platinum-free cobalt phosphide (Co-P) electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the electrode was fabricated on carbon paper by pulse electrodeposition technique with various dissolution amounts of Co. The acid-dissolved Co-P-0.3 electrode showed better electrochemical performance with an overpotential of 143.85 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 and the Tafel slope of 60.10 mV dec -1 . Further, the singlecell water electrolysis experiments were also carried out with Co-P-0.3 as a cathode electrode, which showed the remarkable performance, the achieved current density of 1.89 A cm -2 at a cell voltage of 2.0 V. Tajuddin et al. (2021) reported noble metalfree graphene-encapsulated NiMo alloy as an acid-stable catalyst for HER. The N-doped graphene (4-8 layers) encapsulated NiMo cathode catalyst exhibited an extremely stable electrochemical performance in the potential cycling test of 10,000 cycles. Moreover, exhibited highly stable electrochemical performance after the 100 h of stability test at the constant cell voltage of 2.2 V in single cell PEM water electrolyzer. Recently, Atchudan et al. (2022) developed a noble metal-free molybdenum disulfide decorated banana peel porous carbon (MoS 2 @BPPC) catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The developed MoS 2 @BPPC composite electrocatalyst showed higher HER activity and possessed superior stability in the acidic conditions (0.5M H 2 SO 4 ) with an overpotential of 150 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 , and the Tafel slope of 51 mV dec -1 . Further, Brito et al. (2022) introduced transition metal phosphide catalyst supported on carbon black (FeP/CB) for HER as an alternative to platinumbased catalysts. The prepared 50% FeP/CB catalyst showed better electrocatalytic activity with an achieved overpotential of 252 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 , which is quite close to the 220 mV of platinum catalyst.PEM water electrolysis technology is well developed and commercially available up to megawatt (MW) for industrial and transportation applications, some of the large-scale PEM electrolyzer manufacturers are listed in Table 4.

        <p>The solid oxide water electrolysis cell (SOEC) is one of the electrochemical conversion cells, it converts electrical energy into chemical energy. The development of solid oxide water electrolysis was begun in USA in the year of 1970s by General Electric and Brookhaven National Laboratory, followed by Dornier in Germany (Buttler and Spliethoff, 2018). Typically, the solid oxide water electrolyzer operates with water in the form of steam at high temperatures (500-850 • C) can drastically reduce the power consumption to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen consequently increase the energy efficiency (Hauch et al., 2020;Nechache and Hody, 2021;Choe et al., 2022). This improvement in energy efficiency can lead to a strong reduction in hydrogen cost due to power consumption being the main contributor to the hydrogen production cost in electrolysis (Shen et al., 2020). Apart from that, solid oxide water electrolysis offers two major advantages compared to the existing electrolysis technologies, the first one is high operating temperature which resulted in favorable thermodynamics and reaction kinetics allowing unrivaled conversion efficiencies. The second one is that solid oxide water electrolysis can be thermally integrated easily with downstream chemical synthesis i.e., the production of methanol, dimethyl ether, and ammonia (Khan et al., 2018). Moreover, the solid oxide water electrolysis does not require the use of noble metal electrocatalysts and gives high conversion efficiency. Despite these advantages, insufficient long-term stability has prevented the commercialization of solid oxide water electrolysis. As of now, the reported stability is only 20,000 h with yttria-stabilized zirconia thin electrolyte (Fang et al., 2017).The solid oxide water electrolysis cell (SOEC) is one of the electrochemical conversion cells, it converts electrical energy into chemical energy.

        <p>Typically, solid oxide water electrolysis operates at higher temperatures with the consumption of water in the form of steam and generates green hydrogen and oxygen. During the solid oxide water electrolysis process, initially at the cathode side, the water molecule is reduced into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxide ion (O 2-) by the addition of two electrons. The hydrogen released from the cathodic surface and the remaining oxide ion (O 2-) are traveled through the ion exchange membrane to the anode side. At the anode side, the oxide ions (O 2-) are further reduced to generate oxygen and electrons, then the produced oxygen is released from the anodic surface and the electrons are traveled through the external circuit to the cathode side by the positive attraction of the cathode. The basic working principle of solid oxide water electrolysis is shown in Fig. 13.Typically, solid oxide water electrolysis operates at higher temperatures with the consumption of water in the form of steam and generates green hydrogen and oxygen.
