        <p>With the increasing interests in developing flexible and wearable electronics, there is an urgent need to develop high performance and low cost power sources for smart electronics. [1,2] Metal-air batteries, especially aluminum-air (Al-air) batteries have been considered as a promising alternative because of high theoretical energy density (2796 Wh kg -1 ), low cost and environmental-friendliness with the features of abundant reserves, light weight and low cost of Al. [3] However, the power density of Al-air batteries is unsatisfied due to sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction at air cathodes, hindering the wide commercial application. [4,5] There are two main challenges which need to be addressed to boost cathode performance for metal-air batteries. One is to develop the loaded catalysts with Pt-comparable performance but lower cost, and the other is the fabrication and configuration of air cathodes. Pt-based catalysts can effectively accelerate oxygen reduction reaction, [6] however, the high cost, poor stability and scarcity hinder the commercial application. [7] Therefore, it is urgent to develop efficient and cheap ORR catalysts for Al-air batteries. [8] In past decades, transition metal-based catalysts for ORR have been extensively investigated to replace precious metal catalysts to lower the cost. However, most of these catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory ORR performance. [9,10] Recent studies demonstrate that bimetallic nanoalloys can enhance catalytic activity and stability due to the synergistic effect of bimetallic alloys compared to single metals. [11,12] Furthermore, introducing transition metal species into N-doped carbon materials with good electrical conductivities and large surface areas is an efficient approach to enhance electrocatalytic activity. [13,14] Additionally, low-cost transition metal nitrides with typical metallic behavior and abundant M-N covalent bonds also show promising ORR performance due to effective adsorption of oxygen and efficient electron transfer. [15][16][17] Moreover, tuning interfacial structure of heterogeneous catalysts is considered as an effective strategy to enhance intrinsic electrocatalytic activity due to the regulation of adsorption strength of ORR intermediates. [18,19] Inspired by these attractive properties, it is expected that catalysts with a combination of interfacial structure of bimetallic alloy and transition metal nitrides can be promising candidates toward ORR.With the increasing interests in developing flexible and wearable electronics, there is an urgent need to develop high performance and low cost power sources for smart electronics.

        <p>Furthermore, the configuration and structure of air cathodes, determining the charge and mass transfer rate, play a vital role in battery performance. In other words, oxygen reduction catalysts with high activities cannot guarantee high battery performance of air cathodes. Air cathodes are generally fabricated by slurry casting catalyst powder, carbon black and polymer binder onto current collectors. First, catalysts with nanostructure are easily aggregated during casting to deteriorate electrocatalytic activity. Second, a large amount of additives are needed, which not only increases the weight and cost but also complicates the fabrication procedures. Moreover, the non-conductive binder may increase the inner resistances of air cathodes. [20] Therefore, it is of great interests to fabricate additive-free and integrated air cathodes with high activity to overcome these challenges for high performance metal-air batteries. Directly in situ growth of catalysts on conductive substrates is considered as a straightforward approach to fabricate such additive-free and integrated air cathodes. [21,22] With these considerations in mind, we report an effective and scalable approach to fabricate an integrated and binder-free air cathode of Co 3 Fe 7 nanoalloy and Co 5.47 N encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon foam (Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF) for flexible Al-air batteries in both alkaline (potassium hydroxide, KOH) and neutral (sodium chloride, NaCl) electrolytes. The Co 3 Fe 7 nanoalloy and Co 5.47 N encapsulated in 3D N-doped carbon foam without the use of ancillary materials can facilitate fast mass transport and electron transfer and enhance electrochemical performance and stability. As a result, the Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF with synergetic interfacial structure exhibits superior ORR activity with an onset potential of 1.02 V and a positive half-wave potential of 0.92 V in 0.1 m KOH solution (0.59 V in NaCl solution), which is confirmed by in situ electrochemical Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations. The ORR performance is superior to that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. [23] The integrated and binder-free Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF air electrode with good flexibility displays much better discharge performance than the traditionally slurry casting air cathodes for both alkaline and neutral Al-air batteries.Furthermore, the configuration and structure of air cathodes, determining the charge and mass transfer rate, play a vital role in battery performance.

        <p>The typical preparation procedure of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF is schematically illustrated in Figure 1a. The preparation procedure involves a simple impregnation and one-step pyrolysis. First, the Fe 3+ and Co 2+ ions were evenly adsorbed on melamine foam (MF) by a facile immersion method. Then, the melamine foam with iron and cobalt ions was annealed at 900 °C under nitrogen (N 2 ) atmosphere for 4 h. During the pyrolysis process, the melamine foam was pyrolyzed to form 3D N-doped carbon, which inherits the foam structure, and the metal ions were converted to uniform metal nanoalloy and transition metal nitride.The typical preparation procedure of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF is schematically illustrated in Figure 1a.

        <p>Here it is necessary to mention that the ratio of Co to Fe plays an important role in forming the metal nanoalloy and transition metal nitride, which will be discussed later. Meanwhile, the converted CoFe nanoalloys were acted as catalytic sites to generate N-doped carbon nanotubes in situ grown on the 3D carbon foam. Then, the as-prepared Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was directly pressed onto nickel foam current collector to fabricate the integrated air cathode. When adjusting the ratio of Co to Fe, the Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF and Co 5.47 N/NCF were also obtained.Here it is necessary to mention that the ratio of Co to Fe plays an important role in forming the metal nanoalloy and transition metal nitride, which will be discussed later.

When Fe and Co precursors with a ratio of 0.5:1 were added, the Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was formed. The inset in Figure 1b shows a digital image of 3D integrated Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, which is very lightweight and can firmly stand on a dandelion without destroying its fluffs. Figure 1b shows a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, which is composed of 3D interconnected and continuous carbon skeletons with a diameter of several micrometers. Interestingly, the carbon skeletons were transformed into hollow structure (Figure 1c), which is explained by the self-catalytic function of the transition metal alloy in carbon matrix. The hollow structure can expose more active sites, which can facilitate ORR. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 1d provides details of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, demonstrating the hollow carbon skeletons are uniformly covered by a dense layer of carbon nanotubes with a length of 10-15 µm. Moreover, the magnified image shown in Figure 1e shows that the converted metal nanoparticles with a diameter of 10-20 nm are encapsulated in the carbon nanotubes. When more Fe precursor was added (Fe:Co = 2:1), the obtained product is Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF rather than Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, which is explained that Co is removed from Co 5.47 N to form more CoFe alloy. The obtained Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF displays a similar 3D network structure, however the long carbon skeleton is partially destroyed, and the Co 3 Fe 7 nanoal- loys are grown on the carbon foam (Figure S1e,f, Supporting Information). The results above reveal that the ratio of Fe to Co determines the formation of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF and maintains the integrity of carbon skeletons.The morphology of the as-synthesized NCF, Co S1c, Supporting Information).

        <p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized NCF, Co 5.47 N/NCF, Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF and Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF are shown in Figure 2a. The wide peak at ≈26°is assigned to the (002) crystal plane of NCF, indicating the formation of graphitic structure during the pyrolysis. [24] The obvious diffraction peaks at 44.8°and 65.1°are assigned to (110), (200) crystal planes of Co 3 Fe 7 alloy (JSPDF No. 48-1816). [25] The diffraction peaks at 43.7°, 50.8°, and 74.9°are assigned to (111), ( 200) and (220) crystal planes of Co 5.47 N phase (JSPDF No. 41-0943). [2] The XRD patterns strongly indicate the formation of Co 5.47 N and Co 3 Fe 7 alloy in Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF. Raman spectra in Figure 2b shows D band at ≈1340 cm -1 corresponding to disordered carbon and G band at ≈1585 cm -1 corresponding to graphite carbon. The value of I G /I D can be used to evaluate the degree of graphitization. [26] The I G /I D values of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, Co 5.47 N/NCF and NC are 1.05, 1.01, and 0.99 respectively, suggesting that the addition of Fe and Co can enhance the graphitization degree of carbon foam. [27] The surface area and pore size distribution of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF exhibits a type-IV isotherm with a H 3 -type hysteresis loop, and the corresponding BET surface area is 786.8 m 2 g -1 with a pore size distribution of 3-4 nm range.

[32,33] The deconvoluted Co 2p spectrum in Figure 2e shows two pairs of peaks. The peaks at 779.90 and 794.70 eV are attributed to Co atom in CoFe alloy, while the peaks located at 784.76 and 797.26 eV correspond to Co-N specie. The peaks at binding energies of 781.6 and 796.4 eV are assigned to the shakeup satellites. [34] Similarly, the Fe 2p spectrum is deconvoluted in Figure 2f. The peaks at 709.8 and 719.7 eV are ascribed to the metallic Co 3 Fe 7 alloy, [35] and the other peaks centered at 712.6 and 725.2 eV are attributed to ionic state peaks and the binding energy located at 714.9 and 732.5 eV are shakeup satellite peaks. Electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) was conducted to further confirm the forms of metals in Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF. The representative EELS in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information features the characteristic signals of Fe L 2,3 and Co L 2,3 edges at ≈710 and ≈780 eV, respectively. [32,36] The line profiles of Fe and Co show two strong L 3 and L 2 , which are ascribed to the transition of electrons from the spin-orbit split levels 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 to unoccupied 3d states. The L 3 edge of Fe at ≈707.9 eV reveals the form of Fe 0 , which is in good agreement with literature. [37] The Co-L 3 edge is composed of a fine structure with two features. The peak at ≈779.0 eV is assigned to Co 0 and the one at ≈781.0 eV is assigned to fully coordinated cobalt (Co-N). [38,39] The EELS further evidences the existence of Co-Fe alloy and Co-N at the atomic scale, which is consistent with the observation from XRD and XPS results.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized NCF, Co 5.47 N/NCF, Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF and Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF are shown in Figure 2a.

[47] It is instructive to compare the ORR performance of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF with other similar catalysts from literature, and Table S1 in the Supporting Information lists the onset potentials and half-wave potentials as well as limiting current densities of various CoFe-based catalysts in KOH solutions. It's observed that the ORR performance of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF is superior to many of the previous relevant catalysts.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the ORR catalytic performance of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was also investigated in a neutral solution (3.5 wt% NaCl solution, pH = 7.0) by both RDE and RRDE measurements. As shown in Figure 5a, the Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF shows more positive reduction peak potential (0.60 V) compared with the commercial Pt/C (0.53V), suggesting a prominent ORR activity. Figure 5b shows the LSV curves of the various catalysts. Compared with Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF, Co 5.47 N/NCF and NC, the Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF catalyst exhibits more positive onset potential (0.77 V) and half-wave potential (0.59 V), which are also more positive than those on the commercial Pt/C (0.72 and 0.57 V respectively). More importantly, the Tafel slope of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF catalyst (108 mV dec -1 ) is lower than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (120 mV dec -1 ), suggesting its superior ORR kinetics (Figure 5c). To gain further insight into ORR kinetics, the LSV curves in Figure 5d suggests that Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF catalyst also undergoes a nearly four-electron ORR transfer pathway. As shown in Figure 5e,f, the RRDE result displays that the H 2 O 2 yield on Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF remains below 24% and the average electron transfer is 3.51, which are superior to the commercial Pt/C. It's worth to mention that the kinetics of ORR in the neutral solution is more sluggish, which is mainly due to a low concentration of OH -and the barrier effect of Cl -. [48] In order to evaluate stability of the catalyst, the accelerated durability tests (ADT) were performed by potential cycling between 0.2 and 1.0 V versus RHE in both alkaline and neutral solutions for 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s -1 . Figure S6a,b in the Supporting Information shows that there is no obvious shift in the half-wave potential after 5000 cycles in both alkaline and neutral solutions, indicating the high stability and durability of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF. In order to further analyze stability of the catalyst, HRTEM image of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF after 5000 cycles is shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. Obviously, the interfacial structure between the two phases of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF catalyst still exists, implying that the catalyst is very stable to provide rich active sites during ORR process. To further understand the roles of Co 3 Fe 7 and Co 5.47 N in electrocatalytic performance, the Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was etched in an acid solution to partially remove the metal alloy and metal In situ electrochemistry Raman spectra with an applied potential range from 1.11 to 0.51 V on Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF catalyst using a home-made electrochemical cell (Figure S11, Supporting Information) for ORR were recorded. Figure 6a displays the Raman spectra of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF polarized at different potentials. At an initial potential of 1.11 V versus RHE, the oxygen reduction reaction does not occur, and two bands appearing at 451 and 533 cm -1 are attributed to Co II -OH and Fe II -OH, respectively. [49,50] Shifting the potential to the onset potential of 1.01 V (where ORR occurs), three new bands appear at 379, 506, and 730 cm -1 , which are assigned to 𝜈(Fe III -O), 𝜈(Co III -O) vibrations and O-O stretching of OOH, respectively. [51,52] When further negatively shifting the potential, the intensities of these bands increase and the bands for Co II [53,54] The band observed at 1058 cm -1 is assigned to OH deformation mode due to the existence of alkaline solution and the generation of OH -. When the potential shifted back from 0.51 to 1.11 V, the Raman bands for Co II -O/ Fe II -O reappear and the other bands (Co III -O/ Fe III -O) gradually disappear. Figure 6b shows the normalized Raman intensity of band at 730 cm -1 , which is ascribed to the O-O stretching of OOH during ORR process. [55] The intensity increases when shifting the potential from 1.11 to 0.51 V, suggesting much more accumulation of oxygen intermediates. Therefore, the ORR mechanism is proposed that the OH species are first adsorbed on the main catalytic sites to form Co II Figure 6d shows the calculated free energy pathways of four-electron ORR reaction at zero potential, equilibrium potential and limiting potential. Clearly, all elementary reactions can occur spontaneously at U = 0 V (zero potential) and the free energy pathway is downhill. At the equilibrium potential (U = 1.23 V), the elementary reactions along the four-electron pathway are endergonic and thus thermodynamically unfavorable. The limiting potential U limiting (maximum external potential) at which all the ORR elementary steps on Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF are still exothermic is 1.01 V, which is much more positive than the calculated U limiting for NCF (0.75 V) or Co 5.47 N/NCF (0.83V), confirming the superior catalytic activity of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF toward ORR. The DFT analysis fully supports the experimental results, stressing the key role of interfacial structure between Co 3 Fe 7 and Co 5.47 N in promoting ORR.Furthermore, the ORR catalytic performance of Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was also investigated in a neutral solution (3.5 wt% NaCl solution, pH = 7.0) by both RDE and RRDE measurements.

Catalyst inks were prepared by dispersing 4 mg of as-synthesized catalyst (Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF, Co 3 Fe 7 /NCF, Co 5.47 N/NCF, NCF or 20wt% Pt/C) in 1 mL of solution (240 µL of ethanol, 720 µL of water and 40 µL of 5% Nafion) and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a uniform dispersion ink (4 mg mL -1 ). Then, 20 µL of the catalyst dispersion was deposited on the surface of GC electrode and dried at room temperature, and the loading mass of catalyst was 0.40 mg cm -2 . ORR performance of the catalysts was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques in 0.1 m KOH (≥ 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution or 3.5 wt% NaCl (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution. Prior to electrochemical testing, electrolytes were saturated with oxygen or nitrogen. LSV curves were recorded with a potential window ranging from 0.1 to -0.8 V (vs SCE in alkaline solution) and 0.455 to -0.644 V (vs SCE in neutral solution) at a scan rate of 10 mV s where I r and I d are the ring and disk current densities, and N is the ring current collection efficiency (0.34).Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical performance of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated in both alkaline and neutral solutions with a three-electrode configuration on Gamry REF 600.

            <rs type="software">Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)</rs>. [58,59] A spin-polarized GGA PBE functional, all-electron plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 400 eV, and a projector augmented wave (PAW) method were adopted. Co 3 Fe 7 was simulated using a surface model of p (1 × 1) unit cell periodicity. Co 5.47 N was simulated using a surface model of p (1 × 1) unit cell periodicity. A (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack mesh was used for the Brillouin-zone integrations to be sampled. 15 Å vacuum layer was added to avoid the interaction between adjacent layers. The conjugate gradient algorithm was used in the optimization. The convergence threshold was set 1*10 -4 eV in total energy and 0.05 eV Å -1 in force on each atom. [60] Flexible Al-Air Battery Testing: Flexible Al-air batteries were fabricated by sandwiching the prepared integrated air cathode, gel electrolyte and Al-Mg-Sn alloy foil. The Al-Mg-Sn alloy was casted using high purity aluminum, magnesium particles and tin particles (99.99%) in a resistance furnace at a temperature of 760 ± 5 °C, and the nominal composition was Al-1.0wt% Mg-0.1wt% Sn. The Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF was directly pressed onto Ni foam as the air electrode. The gel electrolyte was prepared as follows: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) powder (1.0 g) was dissolved in water (10 mL) at 90 °C under magnetic stirring until the solution became uniform. Then, 1.0 mL of 18.0 m KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02 m zinc acetate was added into the gel. After that, the gel was poured into a PTFE mold to form a thin film and kept in refrigerator at -20 °C over 12 h to cross-link the electrolyte, and the gel was thawed at room temperature. Thearea of air cathode was 4 cm 2 . The flexible Al-air batteries were tested with LAND testing system (LAND Electronics Ltd.) at room temperature. Galvanostatic discharge and polarization measurements were used to evaluate discharge performance of flexible Al-air batteries.
