        <p>A series of reduced graphene oxide-TiO 2 composites (rGO-TiO 2 ) were prepared by hydrothermal treatment using graphite and titanium isopropoxide as raw materials. The structural, surface, electronic, and optical properties of the prepared composites were extensively characterized by N 2 adsorption, FTIR, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and DRS. GO was found to be effectively reduced and TiO 2 to be in pure anatase phase in all composites obtained. Finally, experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these new materials as photocatalysts in the degradation of ethylparaben (EtP) by UV radiation. According to the band-gap energies obtained (ranging between 3.09 eV for 4% rGO-TiO 2 to 2.55 eV for 30% rGO-TiO 2 ), the rGO-TiO 2 composites behave as semiconductor materials. The photocatalytic activity is highest with a rGO content of 7 wt % (7% rGO-TiO 2 ), being higher than observed for pure TiO 2 (E g = 3.20 eV) and achieving 98.6% EtP degradation after only 40 min of treatment. However, the degradation yield decreases with higher percentages of rGO. Comparison with rGO-P25 composites showed that a better photocatalytic performance in EtP degradation is obtained with synthesized TiO 2 (rGO-TiO 2 ), probably due to the presence of the rutile phase (14.1 wt %) in commercial P25.A series of reduced graphene oxide-TiO 2 composites (rGO-TiO 2 ) were prepared by hydrothermal treatment using graphite and titanium isopropoxide as raw materials.

        <p>Figure 1 depicts thermogravimetric analysis curves for TiO 2 and composite materials obtained in air atmosphere up to a temperature of 800 • C, showing four mass loss regions. The curves reveal an initial mass loss from 35 to 200 • C, corresponding to dehydration and related to the elimination of adsorbed water molecules from the surface; the second loss, between 200 and 325 • C, corresponds to the decomposition of labile oxygenated groups bound to GO sheets; the third loss, between 325 and 600 • C, corresponds to the combustion of carbon and more stable oxygenated groups [37,41]; and the fourth, between 600 and 800 • C, corresponds to the dehydroxylation process. The rGO (%) content of composites was calculated by subtracting the mass loss of TiO 2 alone from the mass loss of rGO-TiO 2 , obtaining 3.7% for 4% rGO-TiO 2 , 6.9% for 7% rGO-TiO 2 , 9.4% for 10% rGO-TiO 2 , and 28.3% for 30% rGO-TiO 2 .

Individual GO sheets are expected to be thicker than in the original graphene due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups bound to both sides of the sheets and the roughness at atomic scale that arises from structural defects (sp 3 bond) generated in the originally flat graphene sheets [45].Figure 2 depicts the diffractograms for graphite, GO, and rGO.

        <p>Application of the Bragg equation to the diffraction peak (001) for GO at 10.78 • yields a value of 0.820 nm, more than doubling the interplanar distance in comparison to the original graphite. The intense peak at 26.56 • , characteristic of graphite, is completely absent in the XRD for GO. A low intensity peak appears at 42.51 • , associated with plane (100) of the honeycomb hexagonal structure of graphite, also indicating the reaction effect. This peak (100) remains after oxidation and, alongside the disappearance of 002, indicates the loss of crystallinity through the generation of defects in the structure [46].Application of the Bragg equation to the diffraction peak (001) for GO at 10.78 • yields a value of 0.820 nm, more than doubling the interplanar distance in comparison to the original graphite.

        <p>The rGO sample diffractogram shows a wide peak centered at 24.47 • , indicating a poor sheet ordering along the stacking direction [41]. This finding is related to the exfoliation and reduction of GO by the elimination of interspersed water and surface oxygenated groups. The interplanar distance is slightly larger in rGO (0.36 nm) than in graphite (0.34 nm), suggesting the presence of some residual surface oxygen groups in rGO.

        <p>The interplanar distance, d 002 , of the sheets in these graphene materials is calculated by applying Bragg's law. The crystal size in direction c (D 002 ) of these materials is calculated by applying the Scherrer equation to the peak (002). Table 2 exhibits the values for the positions of diffraction peaks (2θ), full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, interplanar distance (d 002 ), and crystal size (D 002 ) for each material analyzed. The crystal size of graphite, with the lowest FWHM value, is substantially higher than that of GO or rGO. The size represents the approximate crystal width, which is related to the interplanar distance and allows the number of graphene sheets in the crystal to be calculated (N sheets = D 002 /d 002 ). Estimation of the number of sheets is much higher for graphite (n = 99.3) than for GO (n = 6.4) or rGO (n = 4.0). We observed no peaks of rGO in any rGO-TiO 2 samples (Figure 3), possibly due to their low percentages of rGO, so that they are masked by the diffraction signal for TiO 2 , and/or to destruction of the regular stack of GO through the intercalation of TiO 2 during sample preparation [38,39,41,43,44,48,49].

        <p>There is a wide band at 3420 cm -1 , corresponding to stretching vibrations of the -OH bond in C-OH groups, with possible contributions from carboxylic acids and water [25,[53][54][55][56]. The small peaks at 2918 and 2846 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of CH 2 . The peak at 1715 cm corresponds to the stretching of carbonyl/carboxyl groups (C=O) of the carboxylic functionalities (-COOH) presumably located at the sheet edges [25,53,[55][56][57][58]. The peak at 1625 cm -1 is related to stretching in the sp 2 vibration plane of C=C bond [55,56]. The peak at 1372 cm -1 corresponds to bending vibrations of C-OH hydroxyl groups [25,53,57], and the peak at 1220 cm -1 to bending vibrations of epoxy groups (C-O-C) [25,53,56,57]. The peak at 1030 cm -1 corresponds to the C-O vibration of epoxy, ether, or peroxide groups [53,57]. The results obtained for GO by this technique are highly useful and complement XPS results, because it detects the presence/absence of epoxy groups, which are not differentiated from carbonyls with XPS. All the above peaks are characteristic of GO; however, in the case of rGO, the peaks at 1715, 1372, and 1030 cm -1 (attributed to vibrations of COOH, C-OH, and C-O groups, respectively) decrease in intensity due to the decomposition of these groups during hydrothermal treatment.There is a wide band at 3420 cm -1 , corresponding to stretching vibrations of the -OH bond in C-OH groups, with possible contributions from carboxylic acids and water [25,[53][54][55][56].

All the above peaks are characteristic of GO; however, in the case of rGO, the peaks at 1715, 1372, and 1030 cm -1 (attributed to vibrations of COOH, C-OH, and C-O groups, respectively) decrease in intensity due to the decomposition of these groups during hydrothermal treatment.</p>

        <p>There is a wide band at 3420 cm -1 , corresponding to stretching vibrations of the -OH bond in C-OH groups, with possible contributions from carboxylic acids and water [25,53,[54][55][56]. The small peaks at 2918 and 2846 cm -1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of CH2. The peak at 1715 cm corresponds to the stretching of carbonyl/carboxyl groups (C=O) of the carboxylic functionalities (-COOH) presumably located at the sheet edges [25,53,[55][56][57][58]. The peak at 1625 cm -1 is related to stretching in the sp 2 vibration plane of C=C bond [55,56]. The peak at 1372 cm -1 corresponds to bending vibrations of C-OH hydroxyl groups [25,53,57], and the peak at 1220 cm -1 to bending vibrations of epoxy groups (C-O-C) [25,53,56,57].

This is confirmed by the presence of a peak at 1625 cm -1 caused by bending vibration of coordinated water and Ti-OH groups [57,59]. This peak is also assigned to vibration of the aromatic ring in the GO structure within the composites. The reduced intensity of the peak in the composites at 1720 cm -1 suggests that they largely contain hydroxyl groups rather than ketone or carboxylic groups [58].

        <p>Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and non-destructive technique for characterizing the electronic and structural properties of carbon materials.

The material is highly crystalline when this band is well defined and narrow. The presence of this well-defined sign further indicates the degree of graphitization of the material.

The widths of D and G peaks are substantially greater than in the original graphite, indicating a lower signal and therefore lower crystallinity. In the Raman spectrum of GO, the G band is wider and shifted to higher frequencies in comparison to graphite (1582 cm -1 ), while a substantial increase in the D band is observed. These changes in the width and intensity of D and G peaks indicate an increase in the disorder of the graphitic sheets that form the original material. This disorder derives from the creation of defects through the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups in the basal layer or through a larger increase in the proportion of oxygenated margins [62]. The increase in the D band can be produced by: (i) an increase in the amount of disordered carbon atoms in GO, corresponding to sp 3 domains; or (ii) a significant reduction in the size of sp 2 domains in the layer through ultrasonic oxidation and exfoliation. This suggests the coexistence of sp 2 and sp 3 hybridization; i.e., GO contains crystalline and amorphous forms of carbon [63]. The presence of the D peak is mainly due to a chemical functionalization that affects numerous sp 3 carbon atoms in GOs, but it is attributable to defects in carbon structures in rGOs and varies according to the density of defects and the distance between them. The removal of surface functional groups by the reduction process produces vacancies and the reorganization of atoms in the carbon structure (rings with five or seven members), among other defects.Figure 6 and Table 4 exhibit the Raman spectra of graphite, GO, and rGO, and the parameters obtained from their analysis.

These results are in agreement with previous reports [38,45]. The higher I D /I G ratio for rGO than for GO suggests a reduction in the mean size of sp 2 domains after the reduction of exfoliated GO due to the elimination of oxygenated functional groups by the hydrothermal treatment.

Differences are observed between rGO composites and GO (Table 4), including a systematic variation in the position/intensity of D and 2D bands, indicating its reduction. In general, their position shifts to lower wavelengths (13.7 for D band and 35.3 cm -1 for 2D band) and their intensity increases. These variations in D and 2D bands in the composites can largely be attributed to the anchoring of TiO 2 nanoparticles, which act as defects on the surface of rGO sheets and preserve their structural integrity after the deposition of TiO 2 . Therefore, the presence of these two peaks suggests that the structure of rGO persists within the composite [48]. In addition, the I D /I G ratios in the composites (0.95-0.98) are higher than in the rGO sample (0.89), suggesting a structural disorder related to a strong interaction between TiO 2 nanoparticles and rGO sheets after reduction during hydrothermal treatment [48].

The oxidation process endows the graphite layers and their fragmentation with a certain amorphous character. The ends of the fragments act as defects, thereby increasing the intensity of band D. These results are in agreement with previous reports [38,45]. The higher ID/IG ratio for rGO than for GO suggests a reduction in the mean size of sp 2 domains after the reduction of exfoliated GO due to the elimination of oxygenated functional groups by the hydrothermal treatment. It is reasonable to consider that GO reduction causes fragmentation throughout reactive sites, producing new graphitic domains as well as large amounts of edges that act as defects, increasing the D peak [45].Catalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 26 rGO.

        <p>Figure 7 and Table 5 display the Raman spectra of the synthetized composites and the parameters obtained from them. Differences are observed between rGO composites and GO (Table 4), including a systematic variation in the position/intensity of D and 2D bands, indicating its reduction. In general, their position shifts to lower wavelengths (13.7 for D band and 35.3 cm -1 for 2D band) and their intensity increases. These variations in D and 2D bands in the composites can largely be attributed to the anchoring of TiO2 nanoparticles, which act as defects on the surface of rGO sheets and preserve their structural integrity after the deposition of TiO2. Therefore, the presence of these two peaks suggests that the structure of rGO persists within the composite [48]. In addition, the ID/IG ratios in the composites (0.95-0.98) are higher than in the rGO sample (0.89), suggesting a structural disorder related to a strong interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and rGO sheets after reduction during hydrothermal treatment [48]. It can therefore be concluded that the composites are formed by graphene nanosheets coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The increase in I D /I G ratio intensities from GO, rGO, to rGO-TiO 2 indicates a decrease in the mean number of sp 2 domains formed during the hydrothermal reaction. The increased I D /I G ratio in composite spectra also confirms the formation of rGO-TiO 2 composites by the hydrothermal treatment [39,67,68]. The I D /I G ratio is 20-24% higher in the composites than in GO, and the smallest increase is in the 7% rGO-TiO 2 sample.

In addition, the effect of direct photolysis on EtP removal was studied by using UV radiation alone, which achieves 61.5% degradation after 40 min irradiation with 14.0% TOC removal (Table 8). As observed in Table 8, the presence of TiO 2 in the medium increases EtP photodegradation in comparison to direct photolysis. The percentage of rGO in the composite has a major effect on the photocatalytic performance. Based on the photodegradation rate, greater catalytic activity is observed for 7% rGO-TiO 2 , 4% rGO/TiO 2 , and 10% rGO-TiO 2 composites than for TiO 2 alone. The time to degrade 90% EtP decreases with the use of rGO-TiO 2 composites, and is shortest (23.9 min) when the 7% rGO-TiO 2 sample is used.

        <p>The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of rGO in the TiO 2 composite considerably enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 , increasing the degradation rate constant from 0.031 to 0.096 min -1 in the presence of 7% rGO. The percentage degradation of EtP at 40 min is 72.5% for TiO 2 and rises to 98.6% for 7% rGO-TiO 2 . These results evidence the positive role of rGO in EtP photodegradation. The presence of rGO sheets in the TiO 2 composite favors its photocatalytic activity in the following four ways: (i) rGO sheets improve the adsorption capacity of the rGO/TiO 2 composite by increasing its surface area (Table 1), thereby increasing the concentration of EtP molecules close to the active sites in TiO 2 and thereby improving photodegradation; (ii) graphene is an electron acceptor due to its two-dimension π conjugation structure, and the excited electrons of TiO 2 can rapidly transfer from the conduction band of TiO 2 to rGO in rGO/TiO 2 composites, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and enhancing EtP degradation; (iii) rGO can act as a sensitizer by donating electrons to TiO 2 . These electrons are excited by UV radiation photon, generating superoxide radicals through reduction of the adsorbed molecular oxygen; in addition, positively charged rGO sheets attract TiO 2 electrons and create positive holes in the valence band of TiO 2 , which react with the water adsorbed to generate hydroxyl radicals; and (iv) the presence of C-O-Ti bonds in composites reduces the band-gap energy to a value of 2.55 eV, as reported in Section 2.7, facilitating the transition of electrons from the valence to the conduction band and increasing the concentration of radicals generated [38,80].The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of rGO in the TiO 2 composite considerably enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 , increasing the degradation rate constant from 0.031 to 0.096 min -1 in the presence of 7% rGO.

        <p>The results in Table 8 demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of composite materials depends on their rGO content. Thus, the activity increases when the rGO rises from 4 to 7% and decreases when it rises to 10%, and this decrease is much higher when the sample contains 30% rGO, with the photoactivity being lower for 30% rGO-TiO 2 than for TiO 2 . The mass ratio of rGO to TiO 2 affects the photodegradation process performance because both materials have a synergic effect on pollutant adsorption and photocatalysis. Depending on the type of composite, there is an optimal rGO/TiO 2 ratio that achieves maximum pollutant degradation due to the uniformity of titanium dioxide anchoring. When this optimal rGO amount is exceeded, the performance of the process decreases, because an excess of rGO particles can cover the active sites on the TiO 2 surface or act as recombination centers. This favors the aggregation of rGO-TiO 2 composites, blocking light to the TiO 2 surface and restricting the rGO-TiO 2 contact, thereby reducing the synergic effect [31,60,80].The results in Table 8 demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of composite materials depends on their rGO content. Thus, the activity increases when the rGO rises from 4 to 7% and decreases when it rises to 10%, and this decrease is much higher when the sample contains 30% rGO, with the photoactivity being lower for 30% rGO-TiO 2 than for TiO 2 .

        <p>The above findings indicate that the optimal rGO percentage in TiO 2 composites is around 7% in the present system. Comparison of characteristics of the four composite samples under study shows that 7% rGO-TiO 2 has the smallest crystal size, 17.6 nm (Table 3), and the lowest I D /I G ratio, 0.95 (Table 5). These two characteristics favor the behavior of 7% rGO-TiO 2 , because a smaller crystal size increases the number of active sites exposed to light and a lower I D /I G value indicates a higher proportion of carbon atoms with sp 2 hybridization, favoring the electronic conductivity of the sample and, therefore, its photoactivity.The above findings indicate that the optimal rGO percentage in TiO 2 composites is around 7% in the present system.

        <p>Numerous authors have studied the reference material P25 (manufactured by Degussa but now by Evonik Industries), a mixed-phase TiO 2 photocatalyst (85.9 wt % anatase and 14.1 wt % rutile), for comparison with the materials synthetized in each laboratory [81,82]. The P25 sample is a heterojunction photocatalyst of TiO 2 . Although anatase is commonly considered the most active phase of TiO 2 in photocatalysis, it has been demonstrated that the binding of two phases (anatase with brookite or anatase with rutile) improves the photocatalytic activity in comparison to anatase alone. This improvement is attributable to its effect on the separation of charge carriers, because it traps electrons in rutile phase and minimizes electron recombination. This is similar to the heterojunction between different photocatalysts [83][84][85]. All of the present results indicate that the TiO 2 prepared for this study is a more active photocatalyst for degrading EtP in comparison to commercial P25; this may be due in part to the larger surface area (Table 1) and smaller crystal size (Tables 3 and4) of TiO 2 than of P25. These differences also make rGO-TiO 2 composites more photoactive than the corresponding rGO-P25 composites. Table S4 summarizes the most significant results reported from the literature when using other photocatalysts and UV or solar radiation for the removal of parabens from water.

EtP mineralization was followed by TOC measurements, as described elsewhere [87].Experiments were conducted to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared composites in EtP degradation. They were performed in a UV laboratory reactor system 2 (UV Consulting Peschl, Mainz, Germany) equipped with medium-pressure mercury vapor lamp (TQ 150, nominal power 150 W), pouring 700 mL of EtP solution (0.3 mM) with 0.7 g/L of rGO-TiO 2 into the reactor.

        <p>rGO-TiO 2 composites with different percentages of rGO were successfully prepared using a simple hydrothermal method. The results obtained demonstrated the effective reduction of GO, the formation of pure anatase phase, and the formation of Ti-O-C bonds on composite surfaces. The surface area and porosity are more developed in the rGO-TiO 2 composites than in the GO-P25 composites. The highest Ti/C ratio is observed for the 7% rGO-TiO 2 composite, due to a superior rGO sheets dispersion in the TiO 2 matrix. All rGO-TiO 2 composites obtained behave as semiconductor materials (Eg ≤ 3.1 eV), and a higher percentage of rGO produces a reduction in band gap energies due to the formation of Ti-O-C bonds.rGO-TiO 2 composites with different percentages of rGO were successfully prepared using a simple hydrothermal method.

        <p>The highest photocatalytic activity for EtP degradation under UV radiation is achieved with the composite containing 7% rGO (7%rGO-TiO 2 ), which reaches 98.6% degradation after 40 min of irradiation. However, a higher graphene content leads to the aggregation of graphene nanosheets and TiO 2 nanoparticles, reducing the light absorption capacity and EtP photodegradation.The highest photocatalytic activity for EtP degradation under UV radiation is achieved with the composite containing 7% rGO (7%rGO-TiO 2 ), which reaches 98.6% degradation after 40 min of irradiation.

        <p>The presence of two phases (anatase and rutile) in P25, and the smaller surface area and larger crystal size in rGO-P25 versus rGO-TiO 2 composites may be responsible for the lower photocatalytic activity of the former in EtP removal. In the rGO-P25 composites, photocatalytic EtP degradation reaches the maximum value with a rGO content of only 4%.The presence of two phases (anatase and rutile) in P25, and the smaller surface area and larger crystal size in rGO-P25 versus rGO-TiO 2 composites may be responsible for the lower photocatalytic activity of the former in EtP removal.
