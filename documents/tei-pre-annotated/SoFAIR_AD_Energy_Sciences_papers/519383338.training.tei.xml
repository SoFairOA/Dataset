        <p>Decoupling economic growth from resource use and emissions is a precondition to stay within planetary boundaries. A number of countries have achieved a reduction in their production-based emissions in the past decade. However, the decline in PBE has often been achieved via outsourcing of emissions to other countries, which may even lead to higher emissions globally. Therefore, a consumption-based perspective that accounts for a country's emissions along global supply chains should also be employed when investigating progress in decoupling. Here we investigate the progress countries made in reducing their production-based and consumption-based emissions despite growth in gross domestic product (GDP). We found that 32 out of 116 countries (mainly developed ones) achieved absolute decoupling between GDP and production-based emissions in recent years (2015-2018), and 23 countries achieved absolute decoupling between GDP and consumption-based emissions. 14 countries have decoupled GDP growth from both production-and consumption-based emissions. Even countries that have achieved absolute decoupling are still adding emissions to the atmosphere thus showing the limits of 'green growth' and the growth paradigm. We also observed that decoupling can be temporary, and decoupled countries may switch back to increasing emissions, which means that continuous efforts are needed to maintain decoupling. An analysis of driving factors shows that whether a country can achieve decoupling mainly depends on reducing emission intensity along domestic and import supply chains. This highlights the importance of decarbonizing supply chains and international collaboration in controlling emissions.Decoupling economic growth from resource use and emissions is a precondition to stay within planetary boundaries.

        <p>Given that economic growth is a major political goal (at least for developing countries), decoupling growth from resource use and emissions is a precondition to stay within planetary boundaries [1] , [2] . Green growth theories claim that continued economic expansion is compatible with environmental goals, as technological progress and continual substitution allow us to stay within global planetary limits [3] . This discussion goes back at least to the Limits of Growth [4] , and has been part of dominant policy discourses such as the Brundtland report [5 , 6] and the Sustainable Development Goals stating that "sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards " [7] . Most recently, the European Parliament decided to push for targets to reduce resource use by 2030 and bring EU consumption within planetary boundaries by 2050 [8] . After 40 years of promoting economic growth, the OECD now also recognizes that instead of focussing on GDP, the emphasis of economic policies should (i.e., emissions increase being slower than GDP growth) and are moving towards absolute decoupling while most developing countries have not decoupled. Similar comparisons between developed and developing countries have been provided by Wu, Zhu [17] . Numerous studies have investigated the extent of decoupling for individual countries such as Greece [18] , or developing countries such as Pakistan [19] and Brazil [20] , or at a finer scale of economic sectors [21 , 22] and cities [23][24][25] .Given that economic growth is a major political goal (at least for developing countries), decoupling growth from resource use and emissions is a precondition to stay within planetary boundaries [1] , [2] .

        <p>Most of these studies calculated a decoupling index based on production-based or territorial emissions [24 , 25] . Production-based emissions (PBE) and territorial emissions resulting from the production and consumption of goods and services within a region as well as for export production are often used by authorities to report carbon emissions [26 , 27] . Using such an index would not account for the fact that over the last decades, high-income nations have shifted a large share of their more carbon-intensive production abroad, and their consumers have increased their demand for imported products [28 , 29] , both have led to an increase in emissions abroad. If we use only territorial or productionbased measures, and not accounting for such production and consumption shifts and outsourcing of pollution, these countries would be more likely to show decoupling or green growth, at the expense of exporting countries [28 , 30-37] ].Most of these studies calculated a decoupling index based on production-based or territorial emissions [24 , 25] .

        <p>In contrast, consumption-based emissions (CBE) refer to emissions along the entire supply chains induced by consumption irrespective of the place of production [38 , 39] . This reflects a shared understanding that a wider system boundary going beyond territorial emissions is important to avoid outsourcing of pollution and to achieve global decarbonization. CBE accounting allows to identify new policy levers through providing information on a country's trade balance of embodied emissions, household's carbon implications of their lifestyle choices, companies' upstream emissions as input for supply chain management, and cities' often considerable footprints outside their administrative boundaries [28 , 40] .In contrast, consumption-based emissions (CBE) refer to emissions along the entire supply chains induced by consumption irrespective of the place of production [38 , 39] .

        <p>A number of studies investigated the topic of decoupling of consumption-based emissions in several countries/regions. For example, Mir and Storm [41] compared the extent of decoupling of 40 countries from both production-and consumption-based approaches and found that although these countries' economic growth was decoupled from production-based emissions, their consumption-based emissions were monotonically increasing with per-capita GDP. Some studies further used structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to analyze the drivers of decoupling between GDP, CBE and trade embodied emissions [42 , 43] . For example, Kulionis and Wood [44] calculated the degree of decoupling of consumption-based energy (energy footprint) and GDP in highincome countries and explored the drivers with SDA. However, none of these studies did a global anlaysis of decoupling of CBE and GDP.A number of studies investigated the topic of decoupling of consumption-based emissions in several countries/regions.

        <p>Therefore, this paper discusses the extent of decoupling of economic growth and consumption-based emissions in 116 countries from 1990 to 2018, using the datasets from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 [45] . We apply structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to explore the driving forces of changes in consumption-based emissions in countries with different degrees of decoupling using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) multiregional input-output database [46] . Our study provides new insights to the discourse on green economic growth and decoupling and sheds light on the state of global low-carbon development and climate change mitigation.Therefore, this paper discusses the extent of decoupling of economic growth and consumption-based emissions in 116 countries from 1990 to 2018, using the datasets from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 [45] .

        <p>There are several scopes to account CO 2 emissions of a country. Production-based emissions (PBE) and territorial emissions resulting directly from the production and consumption of goods and services within a region are often used by authorities to report carbon emissions [26 , 27 , 47] . However, consumption in a country is increasingly met by global supply chains oftentimes involving large geographical distances and causing emissions in producing countries [48][49][50] . Therefore, accounting emissions along the entire supply chain to fulfill the final demand of a country, so-called consumption-based emissions (CBE), is necessary to understand why emissions occur and to what extent consumption choices and associated supply chains contribute to total emissions, and ultimately how to manage consumption to achieve climate mitigation targets and environmental justice [51] .There are several scopes to account CO 2 emissions of a country.

When excluding systematic error sources, previous studies have shown that the stochastic variation of national CBE accounts is not significantly different to PBE accounts and in the region of 5-15% [58][59][60] . For example, Wood, Moran [57] present the first comprehensive and systematic model intercomparison and find a variation of 5-10% for both PBE and CBE accounts of major economies and regions using different MRIO database.where 𝑓 refers to the global emission coefficient vector, which represents CO 2 emissions per unit of economic output for all sectors in all countries; 𝑌 * 𝑟 is the final demand vector of region r .

        <p>By employing structural decomposition analysis (SDA) [29 , 62 , 63] , we can distinguish the contribution of different factors to the change of CBE. This approach has also been widely used to investigate drivers of other air pollutants such as SO 2 emissions [64 , 65] , and water [66] and energy footprints [44] .

        <p>It should be noted that there are more than one possible ways of decomposition as more than one factors may drive the changes in CBE. If there are n elements in matrix multiplication, there will be n! possible ways of decomposition.

To ensure robustness, we also calculate the SDA results based on the average of all possible first-order decompositions.

        <p>We employ the PBE and CBE datasets from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 for the decoupling analysis [45] . The CBE in the Global Carbon Budget 2020 are based on economic and trade data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) for making detailed estimates for 1997, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2011. Detailed results are then extended into an annual time series from 1990 to 2018 based on GDP data and trade data [45] . Compared with other databases for consumption-based emission accounting, such as WIOD and OECD ICIO, the CBE data in the Global Carbon Budget 2020 has the widest coverage of countries (116 countries) and the longest time series . Another alternative database is Eora. However, some studies have shown that the Eora database has large uncertainties in production structure and trade data estimated by the automated reconciliation process [56 , 74] . In addition, GDP (constant 2010 US$) and population data in our analysis come from the World Bank. We employ the latest GTAP MRIO (Version 10) for the structural decomposition analysis for its high accuracy in trade data, which is vital to examine the impacts of different internal and external driving factors on CBE. GTAP MRIOs cover 141 (Version 10) regions and 65 sectors for 2004, 2007, 2011, and 2014 [46] . To make the MRIO tables for different years comparable without price bias, we deflate the original current-price data to constant-price data. The price data is collected from National Account Main Aggregates Database and reallocated to the GTAP sectors, following the concordance table in Meng, Mi [63] (See Table S1 ). It should be noted that because GTAP MRIOs (Version 10) and the previous version have different numbers of countries and sectors, the aggregation of regions and sectors will bring aggregation errors while reducing the scope of our analysis [75][76][77][78] . Therefore, in the analysis of driving factors, to ensure the reliability of the results, we only analyze 2004, 2007, 2011, and 2014 included in the latest GTAP MRIOs with consistent sectoral and country resolutions (Version 10).We employ the PBE and CBE datasets from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 for the decoupling analysis [45] .

        <p>As global trade patterns have changed over recent decades, so have emissions embodied in trade (EET) [80] .

The net transfer of EET refers to emissions associated with the production of traded goods and services and is equal to a country's difference between PBE and CBE (i.e., 𝐸 𝐸 𝐸 -𝐸 𝐸 𝐼 = 𝑃 𝐵 𝐸 -𝐶𝐵 𝐸) [81] . Global EET have been rising faster since the 1980s due to an increase in trade volume [58 , 68] . CO 2 emissions from the production of internationally traded products peaked in 2006 at about 27% of global CO 2 emissions. Since then, international CO 2 emissions transfers declined but are likely to remain an important part of the climate policy agenda [82] . Calculations based on the GTAP MRIO show that about 24% of global economic output was traded, and 25% of global CO 2 emissions were embodied in international trade of goods and services in 2014.As global trade patterns have changed over recent decades, so have emissions embodied in trade (EET) [80] .

        <p>For a given country or region with CBE higher than PBE, the country is a net importer with a higher EEI than EEE and vice versa. The shaded areas in Fig. 2 show the net CO 2 trade balances (differences) between each of the six country groups. Blue shading (mainly in developed countries) indicates that the country group is a net importer of embodied CO 2 emissions, leading to higher consumption-based emissions than production-based emissions. Red shading indicates the reverse, which is mainly the case in developing countries.For a given country or region with CBE higher than PBE, the country is a net importer with a higher EEI than EEE and vice versa.

        <p>Fig. 3 shows the trends of CBE and GDP of country groups. During the most recent three-year period from 2015 to 2018, 23 countries (or 20% of 116 countries) have achieved absolute decoupling of CBE and GDP, while 32 countries (or 28%) achieved absolute decoupling of PBE and GDP. Only 14 countries have decoupled GDP growth from both PBE and CBE. Another 67 countries (or 58%) have relatively decoupled, and 19 (or 16%) coupled economic growth with CBE. 6 countries were in an economic recession (i.e., having a decline in their GDP) during the study period. It is important to note that a country's degree of decoupling changes over time. For example, 32 countries achieved absolute decoupling from 2010 to 2015, and only 10 of them remained decoupled over the next three years. Table 1 shows that countries with absolute decoupling tend to achieve decoupling of CBE and PBE at relatively high levels of GDP and high per capita emissions. Most of the EU and North American countries are in this group. This reflects similar findings by Wood, Neuhoff [83] , who found that EU countries have reduced their overall consumptionbased GHG emissions by 8% between 1995 and 2015, mainly due to the use of more efficient technology, both domestically and in imports. In other words, decoupling was not only achieved by outsourcing pollution but also improvements in production efficiency and energy mix, leading to a decline of PBE and CBE [84] .Fig. 3 shows the trends of CBE and GDP of country groups.

        <p>Apart from those developed countries, we observed that some lowerincome countries also achieved absolute decoupling of emissions and GDP. For example, Zimbabwe and Israel show absolute decoupling from both PBE and CBE over 2015-2018; Cameroon showed absolute decoupling of PBE and weak decoupling of CBE and GDP. However, such decoupling in lower-income countries might be exceptions and affected by exogenous factors, such as political instability, recessions, and data quality [57] , and may frequently change over time. For example, Zimbabwe has switched back and forth between "absolute decoupling " and "no decoupling " for the past 25 years (1990 to 2015). Thus, the experience of decoupling in those less-developed regions cannot serve as role models for the rest of the world. Although the same can be said about developed countries and they decoupling given that this was only achieved at very high levels of per capita emissions.Apart from those developed countries, we observed that some lowerincome countries also achieved absolute decoupling of emissions and GDP.

        <p>Another 19 countries, such as South Africa and Nepal, have experienced no decoupling between GDP and emissions from 2015 to 2018, meaning their GDP growth is closely tied with domestic consumption and production of emission-intensive goods. As a result, further increase in GDP in these countries will likely lead to higher emissions if following the historical trend.Another 19 countries, such as South Africa and Nepal, have experienced no decoupling between GDP and emissions from 2015 to 2018, meaning their GDP growth is closely tied with domestic consumption and production of emission-intensive goods.

        <p>We further investigate potential driving factors of CBE for countries with different decoupling types via structural decomposition analysis ( Fig. 4 ). In general, whether decoupling can be achieved mainly boils down to a race between growth in consumption volume and decline in emission intensity.We further investigate potential driving factors of CBE for countries with different decoupling types via structural decomposition analysis ( Fig. 4 ).

        <p>For countries that have successfully achieved decoupling (absolute or relative), decreasing emission intensity of domestic production was the main driver of the decline in CBE (see red line in Fig. 4 ), contributing -21% and -17% of the change in total emissions in countries with absolute decoupling and relative decoupling, respectively. Foreign emission intensity is the second largest driver for reducing emissions, contributing -5.8% and -4.8% to the changes in CBE in those two groups. In comparison, countries without any decoupling had experienced an increase in emission intensity of domestic production, which contributed 5.6% to the changes in their CBE, although the emission intensity of imports has noticeably improved (contributing -7.9% of the total change in CBE).For countries that have successfully achieved decoupling (absolute or relative), decreasing emission intensity of domestic production was the main driver of the decline in CBE (see red line in Fig. 4 ), contributing -21% and -17% of the change in total emissions in countries with absolute decoupling and relative decoupling, respectively.

        <p>In terms of emission drivers, excluding countries with economic recession, increasing consumption volume for domestic products was the biggest factor increasing CBE, especially in countries with relative decoupling and no decoupling ( + 80.2% and 58.0%, respectively). For decoupled countries, the impact of scale on CBE was + 7.8%. The second factor increasing emissions in absolute decoupling countries was changes in consumption pattern for domestic products ( + 3.6%), whereas in countries showing only relatively decoupling or no decoupling, the increase in consumption volume for imports led to an increase of 4.8% and 11.1%, respectively.In terms of emission drivers, excluding countries with economic recession, increasing consumption volume for domestic products was the biggest factor increasing CBE, especially in countries with relative decoupling and no decoupling ( + 80.2% and 58.0%, respectively).

        <p>In 2004-2014, the production technology effect (i.e., the input mix of intermediate goods) had a small impact on CBE in total (see green line in Fig. 4 ). However, specific to the three-time period, it showed significant fluctuations together with emission intensity in 2007-2011, especially for relatively decoupled countries. The change in domestic input mix had significantly reduced these countries' CBE ( -10.0%). Changes in foreign production technology have led to a 4.5% decrease of CBE for absolutely decoupled countries and a 3.4% decrease for no decoupling countries driven by imports from relatively decoupled countries. However, this was a temporary effect in global supply chains induced by the global financial crisis.In 2004-2014, the production technology effect (i.e., the input mix of intermediate goods) had a small impact on CBE in total (see green line in Fig. 4 ).

        <p>Other factors, including trade structure of inputs (i.e., the pattern of international sourcing) and consumption pattern, had a limited impact on CBE. If a country purchases intermediate products from countries with relatively low-carbon intensity, the trade structure of inputs effect contributes to lowering CBE. However, our results show that the green transformation of the global supply chain has not led to significant improvements during the period 2004-2014 ( -0.06% -+ 4.7% at home, and -2.28% -+ 3.61% abroad).

        <p>Although a number of countries have achieved absolutely decoupled economic growth from consumption-based emissions or production-based emissions, this did not stop the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere from continually rising to about 420 ppm in 2021 as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory. Absolute decoupling is insufficient to avoid consuming the remaining CO 2 emission budget under the global warming limit of 1.5 °C or even 2 °C and avoid potential climate breakdown [3] . Overwhelming efforts are needed to reduce global emissions in line with Paris Agreement targets, and the evidence seems to be mounting that even widespread and rapid absolute decoupling alone might not suffice to achieve these goals without some form of economic degrowth [11 , 87 , 88] .Although a number of countries have achieved absolutely decoupled economic growth from consumption-based emissions or production-based emissions, this did not stop the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere from continually rising to about 420 ppm in 2021 as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory.

        <p>The increase in demand for domestic products is the biggest contributor to boosting consumption-based emissions, while the reduction in domestic emission intensity can effectively lower consumption-based emissions. Whether a country achieved decoupling between 2004 and 2014 mainly depended on the relative magnitude of these two factors. For example, the increasing penetration of renewable energy in Europe and a structural shift from coal to gas power in the United States are likely factors for absolute decoupling in these regions [89 , 90] . At the same time, economic growth of these developed countries was relatively weak, and expansion of demand was also slow. Increasing international trade, accelerating global fragmentation, and expanding global value chains have been prevalent in recent decades. As a result, factors beyond a country's control, such as foreign emission intensity, foreign production structure, foreign consumption structure and volume, influence consumption-based emissions. Changes in foreign emission intensity were the second most important driver reducing consumption-based emissions in absolutely and relatively decoupled countries. They even exceeded the effects of domestic emission intensity as the largest factor to reduce consumption-based emissions in some countries showing no decoupling. Also, increasing demand for foreign products is the second largest factor to increase consumptionbased emissions in countries with relative or no decoupling. These findings emphasize the need for supply chain management along the entire global supply chains and the importance of international collaboration for reducing consumption-based emissions.The increase in demand for domestic products is the biggest contributor to boosting consumption-based emissions, while the reduction in domestic emission intensity can effectively lower consumption-based emissions.

        <p>Located downstream in global supply chains, developed countries (mostly in Western Europe and North America and mostly absolutely decoupled countries) tend to be net emission importers, i.e., EEI are larger than EEE [92] . Developing countries tend to be net emission exporters with higher PBE than CBE [ 32 , 93 ], especially for Asia and Developing Pacific (see also Fig. 2 ). That is to say, there is a net emission transfer and outsourcing trend shifting production from developed to developing economies via global trade [70] , mainly caused by cheap labor costs [93] and cheap raw materials [94] . Increasing openness to trade [95] and less stringent environmental legislation (acting as so-called pollution havens) [29 , 67 , 96] are also possible reasons. As a result, carbon leakage among countries has increased [95] 32 .Located downstream in global supply chains, developed countries (mostly in Western Europe and North America and mostly absolutely decoupled countries) tend to be net emission importers, i.e., EEI are larger than EEE [92] .

        <p>The net emissions transferred between developing and developed countries have slightly increased from 6.1% of global emissions in 1995 [58] to a peak of 7.3% in 2006 and then a subsequent decline [82] . One of the reasons for the decline was a decrease in the carbon intensity of traded products of about 40% between 1995 and 2015 [82] . Despite continual improvements, developing economies tend to have higher emission intensity than developed economies due to less efficient technologies and a carbon-intensive fuel mix [52 , 97] .The net emissions transferred between developing and developed countries have slightly increased from 6.1% of global emissions in 1995 [58] to a peak of 7.3% in 2006 and then a subsequent decline [82] .

        <p>Another reason for the decline in emissions transferred between developing and developed countries could be the shift of global trade as well as trade embodied emissions from Europe and the US to Asia. Asian exports in monetary units increased by 136% from 1996 to 2011, and its share of global exports increased from 27% to 48%, whereas Europe's share of global exports decreased from 51% in 1996 to 35% in 2011 [98] . Also, fast-growing Asian countries are catching up with traditional trade hubs (such as Russia and Germany) with fast growth in trade, especially with other countries of the global South [98] . As a result, developing countries are playing an increasingly important role in global trade. Emissions embodied in trade between developing countries, socalled South-South trade, have more than doubled between 2004 (0.47 Gt) and 2011 (1.11 Gt), which is seen as a reflection of a new phase of globalization [63] . Developing countries, therefore, have gained importance as global suppliers of goods and services and have also become more relevant as global consumers as they grow their domestic demand [95] . Since 2014, the CO 2 emission transfer between developing countries has plateaued and then slightly declined and seems to have stabilized at around the same level as between non-OECD and OECD countries at around 2.4 Gt CO 2 per year [82] . In both cases, a decrease in the carbon intensity of trade just about offset the increased trade volume [82] .Another reason for the decline in emissions transferred between developing and developed countries could be the shift of global trade as well as trade embodied emissions from Europe and the US to Asia.

        <p>The results show that 32 countries (mainly developed ones) have absolute decoupling between GDP and production-based emissions in recent years (2015-2018). However, the decline in PBE could have been achieved via outsourcing of emissions to other countries. Our analysis shows that only 23 countries achieved absolute decoupling between GDP and consumption-based emissions. Another 67 countries (or 58%) have relatively decoupled, and 19 (or 16%) coupled economic growth with CBE. 6 countries were in an economic recession during the study period. We also observed that decoupling can be temporary, and decoupled countries may switch back to increasing emissions, which means that continuous efforts are needed to maintain decoupling. An analysis of driving factors shows that whether a country can achieve decoupling mainly depends on reducing emission intensity along domestic and import supply chains. This highlights the importance of decarbonizing supply chains and international collaboration in controlling emissions.The results show that 32 countries (mainly developed ones) have absolute decoupling between GDP and production-based emissions in recent years (2015-2018).

        <p>While there have been some achievements in decarbonizing global value chains these have been by far not sufficient as overall global emissions have continued to rise. Even though some countries have achieved absolute decoupling, they are still adding emissions to the atmosphere thus showing the limits of 'green growth' and the growth paradigm. Even if all countries decouple in absolute terms, this might still not be sufficient to avert dangerous climate change. Therfore, decoupling can only serve as one of the indicators and steps toward fully decarbonizing the economy and society.While there have been some achievements in decarbonizing global value chains these have been by far not sufficient as overall global emissions have continued to rise.
