        <p>Advanced biofuels include biomass sources free from land use such as seaweed. Seaweed biomethane may contribute significantly to a climate-neutral transport future; however, seaweed has limited biodegradability via anaerobic digestion (AD). To address this issue, the authors proposed a cascading circular bioenergy system incorporating pyrolysis (Py) for production of biochar, syngas and bio-oil, with the primary use of biochar in AD to promote biomethane production through direct interspecies electron transfer. The feasibility of the proposed AD-Py system was demonstrated by integrating a seaweed-based AD and a residue-based Py system to enhance advanced biofuels production. The AD results showed biochar achieved comparable performances to high-cost graphene in terms of enhancing biomethane production from seaweed. When digesting Laminaria digitata (common kelp), optimal biochar addition at 1/4 (biochar mass: volatile solid of seaweed) increased biomethane yield by 17% and peak production rate by 29% with accelerated volatile fatty acids conversion during AD. When digesting Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), biomethane yield increased by 16% with optimal biochar addition. A mass and energy balance analysis indicated that processing 1.000 t of Laminaria digitata in AD, combustion of syngas and surplus biochar (in excess of biochar added in AD) from Py of 1.254 t forest residue and 0.078 t dried digestate could fulfil all the heat demand for the integrated AD-Py system. The process integration increased biomethane yield by 17% and bio-oil yield by 10%. Furthermore, a 26% decrease in digestate mass flow could be achieved, thereby reducing the demand for agricultural land for digestate application.Advanced biofuels include biomass sources free from land use such as seaweed.

        <p>The transport sector accounted for 29% of total EU-28 CO 2 emissions in 2017 according to the International Energy Agency's statistics [1]. The development and deployment of advanced biofuels are required for climate-neutral transport, especially long-distance transport vehicles (ships, long-haul trucks and coaches). The recast Renewable Energy Directive (REDII) specifies an increase in the share of advanced biofuels in transport energy demand from 0.5% in 2021 to 3.6% by 2030, and meanwhile proposes a scale-down of food crop-based biofuels from 7% to 3.8% by 2030 [2]. As a platform technology, anaerobic digestion (AD) is capable of converting a wide range of organic substrates to biogas (usually consisting of 50-60% biomethane), whilst providing externalities of waste treatment, improved water quality, clean air, together with rural job creation. Biogas from AD may be upgraded to biomethane (with greater than 98% CH 4 ) for use in natural gas vehicles (NGVs). NGVs are suitable for long haul trucks and coaches; biogas also has applications in ferries in the form of liquified biogas.The transport sector accounted for 29% of total EU-28 CO 2 emissions in 2017 according to the International Energy Agency's statistics [1].

        <p>Advanced biofuels typically do not negatively impact on agricultural output as exemplified by algal biofuels. Seaweed (macro-algae) has a high photosynthetic efficiency, high productivity, and does not compete for finite arable land for food production with a growing world population [3]. Brown seaweed (Kelp) species such as Laminaria digitata (L. digitata) and Saccharina latissima (S. latissima) have been extensively assessed as potential AD feedstocks due to their abundance and high specific methane yield (SMY) [4,5]. Yields of these kelps are optimal in temperate oceanic climates such as in the north east Atlantic. It has been shown that S. latissima may produce 10250 m 3 CH 4 per hectare of sea per year (365 GJ/ha/year) in Ireland [6], a number comparable to the highest range of any tropical land based liquid biofuel system. Therefore, using kelps as alternative substrates for biomethane production through innovative AD technology may significantly contribute to the fulfilment of the renewable energy targets proposed in REDII.Advanced biofuels typically do not negatively impact on agricultural output as exemplified by algal biofuels.

        <p>One issue is the variability in biomethane yield of similar species in the literature as shown in Table 1. This variance may be due to the testing regime (such as the reaction temperature and inoculum to substrate ratio) and to compositional variations in harvested seaweed due to age, temperature of water, and season. Most of these SMYs accounted for a relative low percentage of the theoretical biomethane potential [7]. Allen et al. [6] showed a biodegradability of L. digitata of 48%, while S. latissima had an 81% biodegradability. The relatively low bioconversion efficiencies may be primarily attributed to: (1) the presence of complex polysaccharides, (2) an imbalanced carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and (3) high levels of sulphur, polyphenols and salinity. Generally speaking, high levels of ash with low levels of mannitol and laminarin were observed in winter harvested kelps [8]. The low SMY of the S. latissima sample harvested in February was ascribed to the high levels of alginate, reflecting a low content in readily degradable laminarin and mannitol [9]. High levels of proteins in some kelps have also been observed to cause sub-optimal performance during AD due to the imbalanced C:N ratio [10]. An optimal C:N ratio of 20-30 has been suggested for a stable AD process [11,12]. A C:N ratio of less than could lead to high concentrations of ammonia, which in excess of 5 g/L is deemed inhibitory [13]. The high content of slowly degradable proteins (10-20% of TS), high content of ash (33-39% of TS), and high content of polyphenols (up to 0.13% of TS) led to the low C:N ratios (6.6-13.2), high salinity (10.4 � 0.10-11.0 � 0.08 g/L), and antimicrobial environment during the digestion of winter/spring harvested L. digitata, all of which were responsible for the low SMYs [14]. High content of sulphur and chloride may also raise issues for kelp digesters. In the work by Ometto et al. [15], as the addition ratio of S. latissima (with a sulphur content of 3.4% of TS) increased from 20% to 80% (VS percentage of S. latissima in the mixed feedstock) into the semi-continuous AD reactors treating municipal wastewater sludge, the hydrogen sulphide in the biogas significantly increased from nearly zero to 10 000 ppm, well above the critical threshold for inhibition (200 ppm [13]). In a previous study by Tabassum et al., the chloride concentration in the reactor reached 11 g/L when the mono-digestion of L. digitata failed [16]. Efforts made towards improving AD efficiency typically include feedstock pre-treatment to reduce structure recalcitrance [17][18][19], co-digestion of seaweed with carbon rich biomass to balance the C:N ratio [20,21], and optimisation of operational parameters [22,23]. These efforts generally require additional energy or material input, that may limit the net energy output.One issue is the variability in biomethane yield of similar species in the literature as shown in Table 1.

        <p>Mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) in which two syntrophic partners (fermentative bacteria and methanogens) utilize H 2 or formate as the electron carriers is an essential process within the AD system. However, the efficiency of MIET is relatively low due to the diffusion limitation of electron carriers. Alternatively, direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) induced by conductive carbon-based materials (such as graphene and biochar) may lead to a higher AD efficiency as DIET does not involve the production and diffusion of electron carriers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the conductive nanomaterial graphene could stimulate DIET in complex microbial communities, thereby improving AD performance [34][35][36][37].

        <p>The purchase price for graphene nanosheets was €644/kg from Sigma Aldrich [38]. The average retail price for biochar was about €3/kg according to a market survey conducted by the International Biochar Initiative in 2014 [39,40]. As a cheaper conductive and porous carbon material, biochar can be produced from pyrolysis of various lignocellulosic biomass and has the potential to exhibit a strong electron transfer capability [41,42]. In addition to stimulating DIET, biochar may mitigate feedstock-induced instability through adsorbing microbial inhibitors, enhancing the buffering capacity in the reactor, and immobilising bacterial cells due to its large specific surface area, porosity, and inherent surface chemistry [43]. These findings highlight use of biochar as a low-cost alternative additive for both inhibitor removal and establishment of DIET. Cooney et al. found that the microbial biofilms created by biochar could support the colonisation of acidogens, acetogens and methanogens at the start-up stage of the AD process, contributing to a 69% COD reduction of the high strength wastewater [44]. Wang et al. found that vermicompost derived biochar could alleviate the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and increase pH, thereby improving the stability of the digester at high organic loading rates [45]. From the perspective of the surface characteristics, biochar may have the potential to enhance biomethane production and stability of the AD process as compared to graphene. A gap in the state of the art is the lack of scientific literature on the effects of biochar on digestion of brown seaweed (L. digitata and S. latissima). Optimisation of biochar addition in digestion of seaweed is required to improve the biodegradability of seaweed, which in turn is required to facilitate a climate friendly and financially viable seaweed biofuel industry.The purchase price for graphene nanosheets was €644/kg from Sigma Aldrich [38].

        <p>Although AD technology is relatively mature, it is still faced with several challenges, such as process instability, inefficiency associated with the inability to digest recalcitrant feedstocks (as is the case with seaweed) and associated agricultural land banks for reuse of digestate. Digestate is dominated by undegraded or slow to degrade components of feedstocks (such as lignin, nutrients and microbial cells). If biodegradability is limited to 60% then 40% of potential energy is unutilised. Traditional land application of digestate may lead to waste in the inherent energy value of the digestate, high demand for arable land, high transportation cost of dilute digestate, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with slow to degrade undigested volatile material. The foregoing affects the sustainability of the entire supply chain [46]. Pyrolysis can extract this residual energy in the solid digestate through tuneable production of syngas, bio-oil and biochar. Bio-oil has similar molecules (such as C8 -C16 aromatics along with paraffins and cycloalkanes) to petroleum crude oil, and has potential for use in hard to decarbonise transport sectors such as shipping and aviation [47]. Biochar is a sustainable carbonaceous material with applications in diverse areas, including for, supercapacitors, solid carbon catalysts, improving soil organic content and biological technologies. Application of biochar to soil not only improves soil quality but is deemed a negative emission technology through carbon sequestration [48,49]. Biological technologies such as addition of biochar to an AD process could enhance biomethane production and support the development of stable microbial communities. Biochar can link biological AD and thermochemical pyrolysis in a cascading circular AD-Py system, which may have many benefits including: overcoming recalcitrant features of feedstock; reduction of problematic land application for digestate management; improvement in biofuel production and energy recovery efficiency; and increased economic benefits within the circular bioenergy system. Previous studies have shown that integrating AD and Py could increase energy recovery under optimised conditions [50]. However, the efficiency of an integrated AD-Py system depends on many factors, such as the biodegradability of the feedstock, the allocation of biomass resources to the AD and Py processes, and the interactions between the two processes under different integration scenarios. The efficiency of an integrated AD-Py process based on innovative third-generation feedstock seaweed has not been documented in the literature yet.Although AD technology is relatively mature, it is still faced with several challenges, such as process instability, inefficiency associated with the inability to digest recalcitrant feedstocks (as is the case with seaweed) and associated agricultural land banks for reuse of digestate.

        <p>Deionized water was used to adjust the working volume in each reactor. After the measurement of initial pH (approximately 8.70), the reactors were sealed and purged with N 2 to create an anaerobic environment. Then reactors were placed in water baths to maintain a temperature of 37 � C. The stirrers of all the reactors were set to switch between on and off every 60 s at a speed of 60 rpm. The produced biogas flowed through 3 M NaOH solution to remove CO 2 and other impurities and then passed through the gas tipping devices, which automatically recorded the biomethane production in each reactor. The biomethane yield in each reactor with seaweed feedstock was corrected by the biomethane yield from the blank group to eliminate the carryover effect of the inoculum. All the BMP assays were conducted in triplicate. The significance of differences between BMP means was analysed by multiple comparison test (Post Hoc) using the

        <p>Seaweed harvested in different seasons presents varied organic compositions, leading to variations in biomethane yield [9]. L. digitata harvested in May resulted in relatively low biomethane yields (ranging from 184.0 to 263.0 ml CH 4 /g VS) among all the samples harvested over 12 months [14,25]. This was ascribed to the low C:N ratio (15.0 [14] -16.9 [8]) and high polyphenols content (0.13% [14] -0.18% [8]) in the May harvested L. digitata and high quantities of inhibitory hydrogen sulphide (more than 200 ppm) in the produced biogas [25].Seaweed harvested in different seasons presents varied organic compositions, leading to variations in biomethane yield [9].

        <p>Fig. 1. (a) shows biomethane yield from L. digitata with and without graphene addition. The BMP yield of L. digitata was 200.1 ml/g VS, corresponding to a BI of 44%. Such a low BI suggests that AD of raw L. digitata needs further optimisation to improve energy conversion efficiency. In an effort to stimulate DIET in AD, graphene and biochar were added to promote microbial interactions. As the dosage of graphene increased from 0.125 g (equivalent to an addition ratio of 1/16) to 0.250 g (equivalent to an addition ratio of 1/8), the BMP yield from L. digitata presented similar values to the control group with slight decreases (p &gt; 0.05). This may be possibly due to the adsorption of biomethane on graphene [58,59]. The optimal graphene addition ratio of 1/4 led to the highest BMP yield of 248.8 ml/g VS, a significant increase of 24% (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the control group. However, further increases in graphene addition ratio resulted in decreases in BMP yield. The lowest biomethane yield of 154.2 ml/g VS was observed at the graphene addition ratio of 2/1, which was 23% lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of the control group. Similar phenomenon was observed previously by Lin et al. [34,36,37], the results of which suggested that the optimal concentration of graphene for enhancing biomethane production from ethanol and glycine might be around 0.5-1.0 g/L. The adverse effect of excess graphene was ascribed to the microbial inhibition induced by high concentration of nanoscale particles. Tian et al. found that in contrast to the positive effect on short-term AD, long-term exposure of 0.12 g/L graphene in a digester treating sludge suppressed the growth of dominant species (such as Methanosaeta, Lactococcus and Anaerolinea) and affected the methanogenesis performance afterwards [35]. Palmieri et al. introduced three action modes (namely cutting, wrapping and trapping) between nano graphene oxide and microbes, in which the wrapping could inhibit or even kill the methanogens by causing membrane mechanical injury and oxidative stress [60]. Zhang et al. speculated that wrapping did not predominate until the concentration of graphene oxide reached 0.1 g/L in digestion of swine manure [61]. Dong et al. found that nano graphene oxide significantly inhibited the methanogenic process of wastewater sludge through inhibiting the relevant enzyme activity (coenzyme F420) [62].

        <p>oxide nanosheets contributed to an increase in membrane pressure, which might damage the structure of the cell membrane, leading to discharge of intracellular materials such as RNA [62]. These studies indicate the concern of cytotoxicity of nanomaterials, which may be a limiting factor when applying nanomaterials in AD. However, the comprehensive toxicological mechanisms have not been clearly addressed yet. Compared to the control group, a maximum increase of 26% (p &lt; 0.05) was obtained at a graphene addition ratio of 1/4. Correspondingly, the production rate achieved the first peak value of 25.3 ml/g VS/d on the second day and the second peak value of 27.5 ml/g VS/d on the ninth day at the addition ratio of 1/4. Further increasing the addition ratio to 2/1 decreased the peak production rate to 25.8 ml/g VS/d and delayed its occurrence to the third day. This indicated that excessive addition of graphene resulted in a reduction of biomethane production rate and an increase in the lag phase time. The kinetic parameters estimated by fitting the Gompertz model are shown in Table 5. The modelling results of biomethane potential and biomethane production rate accurately matched the experimental results with coefficients of determination over 0.986. The predicted values suggested that both biomethane yield and biomethane production rate were maximized as the addition ratio of graphene reached 1/4 and decreased with further increases in the graphene addition ratio.

(a) indicated that biomethane yield was enhanced with biochar added at ratios ranging from 1/16 to 1/4. Fig. 2. (b) showed that the peak production rate was achieved one day earlier with biochar addition compared to the control group. The biochar addition at an optimal ratio of 1/4 led to the highest biomethane yield of 234.0 ml/g VS and a relatively high peak production rate of 28.2 ml/g VS/d, corresponding to a 17% increase (p &lt; 0.05) in biomethane yield and a 29% increase (p &lt; 0.05) in peak production rate compared to the control group. The biomethane yield with biochar added at the optimal ratio of 1/4 exhibited no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) to the biomethane yield with graphene added at the same ratio, which may suggest an opportunity for using biochar as a cost-effective replacement of graphene to enhance biomethane yield through stimulating DIET. It is notable that biomethane yield was inhibited as the biochar addition ratio increased beyond 1/1. The lowest biomethane yield of 179.7 ml/g VS was obtained at a biochar addition ratio of 2/1, a 10% decrease (p &lt; 0.05) compared to that of the control group.

[64] when biochar was added at 0.4 g/g TS of sewage sludge. The authors attributed the inhibition effect to the nonselective adsorption of nutrients and useful metabolites and the destruction of the microorganism diversity caused by biochar [63,64].

The butyric acid accumulated to the peak level of 120.2 mg/L on the ninth day with graphene addition, while it accumulated to the peak level of 94.9 mg/L on the fourth day with biochar addition. The addition of graphene and biochar accelerated acidogenesis and acetogenesis. In a previous study, Wang et al. concluded that biochar accelerated the conversion of butyrate to acetate by promoting DIET [65].</p>
        <p>The concentration of propionic acid during AD is specified in Fig. 4. (b). Propionic acid in the control group reached 239.6 mg/L on the sixth day, then was gradually consumed in AD. With graphene addition at a ratio of 1/4, propionic acid reached the highest concentration of 216.4 mg/L on the fourth day and decreased rapidly to 10.0 mg/L on the sixth day. With addition of biochar at a ratio of 1/4, the highest concentration of propionic acid 211.9 mg/L occurred on the fourth day. Thereafter, propionic acid was degraded gradually to zero on the ninth day. The anaerobically oxidation of butyrate and propionate to acetate through MIET pathway are described in R1 and R2. The energy barrier to oxidize propionate to acetate (ΔG 0' ¼ þ71.6 kJ/mol) is much higher as compared to that for butyrate (ΔG 0' ¼ þ48.3 kJ/mol), which agrees with the results of Wang et al. [65,66] and Amani et al. [67]. Therefore, the accumulation of propionic acid in the control group led to the slower acetogenic rate of propionic acid, consequently, a lower biomethane production rate. The addition of graphene and biochar alleviated the accumulation of propionic acid and promoted its syntrophic oxidation via DIET enhancement.

        <p>Table 8 provides a brief review of biochar application in AD, indicating that biochars derived from various biomass are capable of enhancing biomethane production by 8%-72%. However, the optimal addition ratio varies significantly depending on the biochar properties and feedstock characteristics. In this study, the biomethane yield from both L. digitata and S. latissima were enhanced with suitable biochar additions. However, excessive addition of biochar hampered AD performances. The effects of biochar on AD of straw and cow manure were investigated by Shen et al. [71], whose results showed that when biochar doses were too high, cumulative methane yields decreased in response to the shift of dominant archaea from Methanosaeta to Methanosarcina. The adverse effects of excessive biochar were also observed in AD of food waste [72,73], hydrogen fermentation of municipal solid waste [74], and AD of citrus peel waste [75]. The decreased methane yield may be related to a decrease in soluble organic substrate availability due to the strong adsorption of biochar or the destruction of the microorganism diversity induced by biochar [62,76].Table 8 provides a brief review of biochar application in AD, indicating that biochars derived from various biomass are capable of enhancing biomethane production by 8%-72%.

        <p>In this study, biochar addition increased biomethane yield from L. digitata by 17% which is comparable to the enhancement effect of graphene at the same addition ratio, though biochar and graphene differ in their properties. There are still arguments on how biochar properties relate to DIET promotion mechanisms. Some researchers reported that the excellent conductivity of biochar rather than the functional quinone moieties is the key property to promote DIET [77,78]. However, it has also been reported more recently that the bulk conductivity of biochar does not play the decisive role in enhancing AD. Carbon cloth and granular activated carbon could induce similar enhancement in AD performance, even though their conductivities were different by several orders of magnitude [79]. Barua et al. speculated that there may be a critical value for conductivity promoting AD, beyond which conductivity is no longer a limiting factor [80]. Shanmugam et al. observed that in the AD of glucose and aqueous phase bio-oil, biochar increased biomethane yield by 72%; while granular activated carbon increased the yield by 40% [81]. An explanation was that the redox-active moieties on biochar promoted the electron transfer between fermentative bacteria and methanogens [81]. Zhang et al. [82] also reported that the electron transfer through the biochar depends on the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups. Sun et al.

        <p>Other surface characteristics also play important roles in facilitating the performance of AD, such as specific surface area, porosity, surface functional groups, and alkalinity, which are associated with the adsorption of substrate induced inhibitors, the colonisation of microbial cells, and the pH buffering capacity.

Kizito et al. reported that biochars exhibited a decrease in NH 3 adsorption with an increase in the particle size [83], but the specific surface area may not be the predominant factor in biochar adsorption [83,84].

The LHV of the obtained bio-oil (on an organic phase basis), biochar, and syngas are 20.4 MJ/kg, 29.2 MJ/kg, and 10.3 MJ/kg, respectively, which are calculated according to Eq. ( 5) based on the reported elemental composition of the products [102]. (2) Electricity input for pre-treating forest residue (such as powering the pumps, compressors, feedstock grinding, and the belt dryer) is 0.5 MJ/kg dry matter [102]. Heat demand for drying the forest residue and for heating the pyrolysis reactor is 4.0 and 2.0 MJ/kg dry matter, respectively [102]. (3) The produced biochar and syngas are burnt to generate heat, which is used for drying the forest residue and reheating the heating medium circulated to the pyrolysis reactor. The heat efficiency of the combustor is assumed as 90%. As the heat demand for running the system can be self-sustained by the heat produced from biochar and syngas combustion, the primary energy consumption of the Py system contains only grid electricity consumption for forest residue pre-treatment. Table S3 in the supplementary material presents the detailed calculations. Fig. 9 shows the mass and energy balance of the Py system. The mass and energy calculations are based on processing 1.254 t forest residue with an energy value of 10659.0 MJ. This feeding parameter is determined in the design of cascading AD-Py system in section 3.4.2. The production of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas is calculated as 0.455, 0.151, and 0.076 t, respectively. The energy value of bio-oil is 6491.3 MJ. The obtained syngas and biochar are burnt to produce 4677.4 MJ of heat. In excess of the heat consumption for drying forest residue (2726.1 MJ) and heating the pyrolysis reactor (1363.0 MJ), the combustion of syngas and biochar generates significant surplus heat of 588.2 MJ which could be sold to the public via a district heating grid. The energy output of the Py system is 7133.9 MJ including the energy value of bio-oil and surplus heat. The electricity consumed for forest residue pre-treatment is 340.7 MJ, leading to a total primary energy consumption of 783.8 MJ. Therefore, the net energy gain in the Py system is 6361.2 MJ, resulting in a process efficiency of 62.4%.

        <p>As mentioned previously, surplus heat is produced in an individual Py system. Based on the individual AD and Py system, an integrated AD-Py system is proposed, in which the surplus heat is used in the AD system for heating the digester and drying the solid digestate. The dried digestate is pyrolyzed together with the forest residue to produce more bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. The pyrolysis of solid digestate can contribute to not only the generation of value-added biofuels but also the reduction in the cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with digestate management. Biochar produced in the Py system is added into the anaerobic digester to enhance biomethane production. A preliminary mass and energy balance were drawn to assess the benefits of integrating AD and Py systems based on the following assumptions:As mentioned previously, surplus heat is produced in an individual Py system.

        <p>(1) The calculations are based on treating 1.000 t wet L. digitata in the AD system. Biochar produced in the Py system is added into the digester at a mass ratio to the VS in L. digitata of 25%. (2) The heat requirement for drying wet solid digestate (70% moisture content) includes the heat required to increase the temperature of digestate from 25 � C to 100 � C and the heat required for water evaporation [106]. The electricity required for digestate pelletizing is 150 kWh/t dried solid digestate [98]. (3) To cover all the heat demand in the AD-Py system by burning syngas and surplus biochar (in excess of the biochar added into the digester), on a per tonne basis of L. digitata at least 1.254 t forest residue is needed to feed the Py system together with the dried solid digestate (0.078 t). The yield of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas from forest residue remains as the yield in the individual Py process. The yield of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas from dried digestate is 58.4%, 32.8%, and 8.8% on a dry matter basis, respectively [98]. (4) The LHV of the digestate derived bio-oil and syngas is 22.1 MJ/kg and 12.5 MJ/kg, respectively [98]. The LHV of digestate derived biochar is not specified in the same paper [98] but has been reported in a range of 21.8-27.1 MJ/kg [107][108][109][110][111][112][113][114]. These values are lower compared to that of the forest residue derived biochar due to the higher ash content in the digestate. As the characteristics of biochar produced from seaweed digestate are not available in the literature, the LHV of digestate derived biochar is modelled as 24.5 MJ/kg according to Ref. [113,114], in which the digestates showed elemental distributions similar to the L. digitata digestate in this study.(1) The calculations are based on treating 1.000 t wet L. digitata in the AD system.

        <p>Table S4 in the supplementary material presents the detailed calculations of the overall integrated system. Fig. 10 shows the mass and energy balance of the integrated AD-Py system. Due to the addition of biochar, the biomethane and carbon dioxide yields from 1.000 t L. digitata are improved to 17.784 and 11.856 m 3 , respectively. In the segregation process, 0.259 t wet solid digestate and 0.723 t liquid digestate are obtained. The yield of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas is 0.500, 0.177, and 0.082 t, respectively. The energy value of bio-oil is 7043.5 MJ. The syngas and surplus biochar are burnt to produce 4829.3 MJ of heat, which can fully cover the heat demand in the integrated AD-Py system for drying the digestate and forest residue and heating the digester and pyrolysis reactor. The energy output of the AD-Py system is 7682.1 MJ including the energy value of output biomethane, bio-oil, and surplus heat from combustion. The total electricity consumption for biogas production, digestate segregation, digestate pelletizing, and forest residue pre-treatment is 431.8 MJ, leading to a total primary energy consumption of 993.2 MJ. Therefore, the net energy gain in the AD-Py system is 6688.8 MJ. The process efficiency is 59.7%, which is lower than that of the individual Py system (62.4%) but much higher than the efficiency of the individual AD system (38.1%).Table S4 in the supplementary material presents the detailed calculations of the overall integrated system.

        <p>The integrated AD-Py system leads to an increase of 17% in biomethane yield and an increase of 10% in bio-oil production compared to the individual AD and Py systems. The net energy gain is slightly improved by 0.1%, despite the additional energy requirement for processing digestate. Wet solid digestate (accounting for 26% of the digestate mass) from AD is valorised in the Py system, which could significantly reduce the arable land requirement for digestate spread, the cost for digestate transportation/storage, and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with land application. Monlau et al. reported that the syngas and bio-oil produced in pyrolysis of digestate could increase the electricity production of the AD plant by 42%, even though the biomethane production did not change [98]. Salman et al. [100] demonstrated an approximate 7% increase in the efficiency of a combined AD-Py process by assuming a 5% increase in methane content as a result of biochar addition into the digester. With consideration of both the pyrolysis of digestate and the effect of biochar addition on AD, the enhancement in biomethane and bio-oil production is more encouraging in the cascading circular AD-Py system proposed in this study. It should be noted that these cited studies did not take into account the primary energy factors for electricity and heat, which means that the energy calculations were not conducted on a unified primary energy baseline. In this study, the energy consumption was converted into primary energy consumption with factors of 2.3 and 1.1 for electricity and heat, respectively, which in essence led to higher values of total primary energy consumption. If renewable electricity such as from wind, wave, and solar could be used in this integrated AD-Py system, the process efficiency would be significantly improved as the primary energy factor for renewable electricity is 1.0.The integrated AD-Py system leads to an increase of 17% in biomethane yield and an increase of 10% in bio-oil production compared to the individual AD and Py systems.

        <p>This study demonstrated the benefits of the integration of AD and pyrolysis. However, it may have some constraints or sub-optimal operation, such as unutilised CO 2 from the AD system and uncertainty in economic, environmental, and social costs. From the technical perspective, the production of biochar with tailored properties for DIET enhancement in AD, alternative utilisation of biochar as a soil amendment for carbon sequestration, and the development of further technology integration (including biomethanation via the biological Sabatier reaction or photosynthetic micro-algae biogas upgrading [115]), offer potential opportunities for further enhanced energy production efficiency and enabling a negative emission technology system. From the policy perspective, comprehensive life cycle analysis and techno-economic assessment of the integrated system are necessary to demonstrate the environmental/economic sustainability and identify the bottlenecks in commercialisation. From the industry perspective, a multi-objective optimisation of the operational strategy including for resource allocation and logistics required to maximize profit and carbon sustainability of the entire supply chain from the resource to the market is necessary [116,117].This study demonstrated the benefits of the integration of AD and pyrolysis.

        <p>This study demonstrated that biochar could significantly enhance biomethane yield in AD of seaweed. In digestion of L. digitata, biochar addition at an optimal ratio of 1/4 enhanced biomethane yield by 17% and peak production rate by 29%, which are comparable to the effects of graphene. Similarly, the recommended biochar addition in digestion of S. latissima led to a 16% increase in biomethane yield and a 30% increase in peak production rate. Based on the experimental results, a cascading circular AD-Py system was proposed by integrating the AD system processing L. digitata and the Py system processing forest residue. A preliminary mass and energy balance analysis indicated that to self-sustain all the heat demand in the AD-Py system by burning syngas and surplus biochar (in excess of the biochar added into the digester), pyrolysis of at least 1.254 t forest residue together with 0.078 t dried solid digestate is needed based on 1.000 t L. digitata processed in AD. The process integration increased biomethane yield by 17% and bio-oil yield by 10%. Meanwhile, a reduction of 26% in the digestate mass flow could be achieved, which may enable significant reductions in arable land requirement, transport cost, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with digestate application.This study demonstrated that biochar could significantly enhance biomethane yield in AD of seaweed.
