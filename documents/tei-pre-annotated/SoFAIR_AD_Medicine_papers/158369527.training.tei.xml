        <p>The Banff 2017 Kidney Meeting Report: Revised diagnostic criteria for chronic active T cell-mediated rejection, antibodymediated rejection, and prospects for integrative endpoints for next-generation clinical trials.</p>
        <p>The XIV Banff Conference for Allograft Pathology was held March 27-31, 2017, in Barcelona, Spain, in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Catalan Society of Transplantation. A total of 479 delegates from 23 countries attended the conference, including pathologists, immunologists, physicians, surgeons, and immunogeneticists. The main aim of the 2017 conference was to revisit the current diagnostic criteria for chronic T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), especially the significance of inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (i-IFTA). In addition, discussion related to the relevance and potential integration of molecular transplant diagnostics into the Banff classification was continued along the roadmap developed at the 2015 Banff meeting. 1 This included an update of the criteria for assessing molecular features related to antibody-mediated tissue injury as a potential alternative/complement to donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) for diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). In alignment with ongoing efforts of the American Society of Transplantation (Transplant Therapeutics Consortium) and the American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (STAR initiative [Sensitization in Transplantation: Assessment of Risk]), the Banff 2017 conference was preceded by a full-day premeeting on "New Endpoints for Next-Generation Clinical Trials" in which the current and future role of the Banff classification and unmet needs for the field with regard to surrogate endpoints were discussed. In addition, the meeting included as a standing item an update session on the ongoing activities of the Banff Working Groups, which is summarized in Table 1.</p>
        <p>This meeting report focuses on the main outcomes from the Banff kidney sessions, and the resulting changes to the classification. The main conclusions from the 2017 Banff liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and vascularized composite allograft sessions will be published elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The next XV Banff meeting will be held jointly with the American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics in Pittsburgh, PA, September 23-27, 2019.</p>
        <p>The approval of novel drugs in the field of kidney transplantation has been dampened by several factors. One of the explanations for the failure of trials testing new agents has been the success of the "gold standard" immunosuppression demonstrated in the Symphony study and on the other hand, the relative lack of success of new agents. 2 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved primary endpoints, such as 1-year graft and patient survivals, are irrelevant today for superiority trials, due to excellent graft and patient survival in the overall transplant populations (~95%) and are difficult to improve further. Designing studies with 5-or 10year graft and patient survival as primary endpoints are unrealistic in terms of costs, especially as transplantation is a small field/market</p>
        <p>The kidney sessions of the 2017 Banff Conference focused on 2 areas: clinical implications of inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (i-IFTA) and its relationship to T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and the continued evolution of molecular diagnostics, particularly in the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). In confirmation of previous studies, it was independently demonstrated by 2 groups that i-IFTA is associated with reduced graft survival. Furthermore, these groups presented that i-IFTA, particularly when involving &gt;25% of sclerotic cortex in association with tubulitis, is often a sequela of acute TCMR in association with underimmunosuppression. The classification was thus revised to include moderate i-IFTA plus moderate or severe tubulitis as diagnostic of chronic active TCMR. Other studies demonstrated that certain molecular classifiers improve diagnosis of ABMR beyond what is possible with histology, C4d, and detection of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) and that both C4d and validated molecular assays can serve as potential alternatives and/ or complements to DSAs in the diagnosis of ABMR. The Banff ABMR criteria are thus updated to include these alternatives. Finally, the present report paves the way for the Banff scheme to be part of an integrative approach for defining surrogate endpoints in next-generation clinical trials. with potentially repositionable drugs known already for their adverse reaction profiles. Acute rejection is also recognized as a primary endpoint for clinical trials in transplantation by health authorities, but TCMR and ABMR do not have the same impact on graft outcome. Furthermore, the transplant community and the industry aiming to introduce new agents are addressing these issues independently.</p>
        <p>The Banff process has evolved from being a primarily pathologydriven group to a more comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach that includes relevant subject matter expertise from immunogeneticists, clinicians, and pathologists with the goal to establish and refine integrative diagnostic standards in transplantation. To accelerate the development of new immunosuppressive agents, Banff is currently working closely with regulatory agencies and international societies to define realistic and feasible endpoints and approaches for next-generation clinical trials. 3,4 Various specialty societies and consortia have identified the unmet need for the validation of surrogate endpoints in order to evaluate responses to therapy and predict long-term kidney allograft outcomes. During the 2017 Banff premeeting, those new challenges were addressed with a specific focus on histologic, immunologic, and molecular endpoints.</p>
        <p>Rejection episodes confirmed by histology are recognized as the cornerstone of diagnosis and prognosis in kidney and transplantation pathology. However, the current FDA/EMA-approved surrogate histologic endpoint, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR), is no longer reflecting current diagnostics in renal transplantation, where the impact of acute TCMR on outcome has declined. As an example, in the BENEFIT Study, BCAR was used as primary endpoint for noninferiority, and there was more BCAR (TCMR) in the arm receiving belatacept (vs cyclosporine), but this did not lead to a higher rate of graft loss in the long term as shown by the BENEFIT-EXT study. 5,6 To regain usefulness as primary endpoints for trials in kidney transplantation, histologic markers need to follow a validation process as outlined during the Banff meeting (Table 2A).</p>
        <p>In Table 2B, we listed our recommendations on best practices for molecular endpoints in clinical trials. Potential diagnostic and prognostic molecular endpoints and biomarkers are listed in Tables 3 and4.</p>
        <p>To be a potential surrogate endpoint, anti-HLA DSAs have not only to be considered within the context of their potential limitations (titration rather than mean fluorescence intensity to reveal oversaturation) but also by integrating their properties (eg, complement activating capacity, IgG subclasses, cytotoxic effect). However, current shortcomings of DSA testing (variability in test methods, diagnostic threshold definitions, clinical significance standards) are known to limit its utility as a sole endpoint. Ongoing efforts of the STAR initiative are aiming to address these.</p>
        <p>The participants in the 2017 Banff premeeting support a path toward integrated diagnostic and prognostication systems by exploring opportunities provided by advanced data and applied statistics from the field of machine learning. 7 To this end, the Banff group formed a new working group on surrogate endpoints aimed at fostering collaboration with other professional societies and regulatory agencies on the common goal to develop a path forward to successful nextgeneration multicenter trials and approval of novel drugs in solid organ transplantation.</p>
        <p>The Banff 2015 meeting report noted for the first time that chronic active TCMR may be manifest in the tubulointerstitial as well as in the vascular compartment. 1 However, the current Banff classification does not provide specific criteria regarding how tubulointerstitial changes should be considered for diagnosing chronic active TCMR, although Banff consensus criteria for semiquantitatively scoring inflammation in areas of IFTA (i-IFTA) as a histologic lesion have been established. Although potential problems in scoring i-IFTA might be anticipated as scattered inflammatory cells are often seen in what might be considered by many pathologists to be bland fibrosis, the Paris group 8 reported good agreement among 3 pathologists in grading i-IFTA according to the Banff 2015 criteria, with complete agreement between all 3 pathologists in 101 (67%) of 150 cases, and a κ value of .62.</p>
        <p>The impact of i-IFTA on graft outcomes was first suggested by the finding of Mengel et al 9 that total cortical inflammation (Banff ti score) was more predictive of graft loss than inflammation in nonsclerotic areas of cortex (Banff i score). Independently, the DeKAF study 10 showed a strong association between the severity of i-IFTA and graft loss, far stronger than that of IFTA alone. Degrees of inflammation involving &gt;25% of areas of cortex with IFTA (corresponding to Banff 2015 i-IFTA scores 2 and 3) were significantly associated with an increased risk of graft loss in multivariate models. 10 These findings were independently validated by recent studies of Lefaucheur, Loupy, and coworkers 8 and Nankivell et al 11 The amenability of i-IFTA to immunosuppressive therapy remains an important question, and findings of the DeKAF study showed that the effect of i-IFTA on graft survival was not significantly affected by treatment for concomitant acute TCMR. 10 Still, data presented by the Paris group 8 showed that i-IFTA is related to underimmunosuppression, and both this group and Nankivell et al 11 found that i-IFTA is typically preceded by TCMR. Furthermore, the frequency of i-IFTA in protocol biopsy specimens has declined in the era of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression compared with that of cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. 11 Taken together, these findings suggest that i-IFTA, at least in many instances, is related to chronic underimmunosuppression and thus can represent showing that any progressing chronic kidney diseases are associated with increased expression of acute kidney injury transcripts. Thus, i-IFTA is the morphologic correlate of active injury, compared with IFTA with no inflammation, and predicts disease progression as part of an active injury process damaging the nephron and potentially warranting treatment. 12,13 Clearly, i-IFTA is not a specific lesion, and adding i-IFTA by itself, even if moderate to severe, to the classification as diagnostic of chronic active TCMR does not appear warranted based on present data. It is well known that many other disease processes, including BK virus infection, pyelonephritis, ABMR, recurrent glomerulonephritis, and obstruction, may at some point present with i-IFTA. The nonspecificity of i-IFTA for rejection, proved by the fact that it occurs in native kidneys, was the main reason why i-IFTA and tubulitis in atrophic tubules was specifically excluded from the classification at the first Banff meeting. However, since 1991, immunosuppression has changed and graft survival improved with more patients presenting late posttransplantation with i-IFTA requiring differential diagnostic resolution to guide treatment. Based on the most recent data taking this evolution into account, i-IFTA is likely to be a manifestation of TCMR when associated with other features of ongoing T cell-mediated alloimmunity, such as tubulitis or a history of TCMR episodes in a patient, especially after excluding other diseases known to be associated with i-IFTA (eg, BK, ABMR, GN, obstruction). The study from the Paris group did show that i-IFTA was significantly correlated with the presence of tubulitis, in both scarred and nonscarred areas of the cortex. 8 Thus, at present and to minimize overdiagnosis, tubulointerstitial lesions of chronic active TCMR have been added to the working classification (Table 5) as a combination of i-IFTA and tubulitis involving all but severely atrophic tubules, with moderately high thresholds for both (i-IFTA2-3; t2-3), a requirement for inflammation involving &gt;25% of the total cortex present, and other differential diagnoses known to be associated with i-IFTA (eg, chronic pyelonephritis, BK nephropathy) being ruled out. Notably, Lefaucheur et al 8 found that i-IFTA scores of 2 and 3, but not 1, as well as t2 and t3 tubulitis (but not t1) within areas of IFTA, excluding severely atrophic tubules, were associated with an increased rate of graft loss. This conservative approach has served the Banff group well in the past, with the introduction of C4d-negative ABMR. 14 As with the latter (see later), future modifications will be considered as new data emerge from the Banff TCMR working group inflammation, edema, and tubulitis using 3 different histologic stains (hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson trichrome).</p>
        <p>The silver-stained sections in Figure 1 show tubulitis in mildly to moderately atrophic tubules (best evident in panels B and D), and both of these biopsy specimens also show some severely atrophic tubules.</p>
        <p>The latter tubules are defined by having a diameter &lt;25% of that of unaffected or minimally affected tubules on the biopsy, often with an undifferentiated-appearing, cuboidal, or flattened epithelium (or, in some cases, even loss of epithelium with denudation of the tubular basement membrane) and pronounced wrinkling and/or thickening of the tubular basement membrane. This definition of severely atrophic tubules also includes very small, endocrine-like tubules with very narrow lumens, although the basement membranes of the latter may not be thickened. Frequently, severely atrophic tubules will show tubulitis even if there is minimal accompanying interstitial inflammation; this is true even in native kidney biopsy specimens. Therefore, tubulitis in these tubules is presently not considered toward the diagnosis of chronic active TCMR (Table 5), although this point requires further study, which will be done by the TCMR working group. The interobserver reproducibility of pathologists to distinguish severely atrophic tubules from less atrophic ones will also need further testing, although encouraging results were reported by the Paris group. 8 They reported a complete agreement rate between 3 pathologists of 72% and a κ value of .58 in grading tubulitis in areas of IFTA excluding severely atrophic tubules, although the latter were not defined by a specific reduction in size. active ABMR, chronic active ABMR, and C4d staining without histologic evidence of rejection (Table 5). The potentially confusing categories of "suspicious for active ABMR" and "suspicious for chronic active ABMR" are now eliminated. It should be stressed here that these new criteria allowing for the diagnosis of ABMR in the absence of detectable DSAs do not constitute recognition of "antibody-negative ABMR" in the sense that Banff 2013 first recognized C4d-negative ABMR. It is rather an acceptance of the fact that current DSA testing methods do not detect all antibodies that are potentially injurious to the allograft, including some non-HLA antibodies, and that using the alternative markers discussed next will allow us to diagnose and treat a small but significant subset of cases of ABMR where current DSA testing methods fall short or are not available. Finally, DSA testing remains strongly recommended in all cases with biopsy specimens meeting the morphologic criteria (criteria 1 and 2) for active or chronic active ABMR (Table 5), not only for ABMR diagnosis but also for risk stratification, evaluating the response to treatment and further patient monitoring.</p>
        <p>A minor consideration in the revised classification, discussed later, involves the removal of the word "acute" from "acute/active ABMR."</p>
        <p>Compared with the previous ( 2007 specificity for the presence of DSAs if positive. [26][27][28] False-positive C4d staining in peritubular capillaries was not seen in studies of native renal biopsy specimens or preimplantation biopsy specimens of donor kidneys. 29,30 Accordingly, it was agreed that C4d staining in at least 10% of peritubular capillaries (C4d2 or C4d3) by IF on frozen sections or in any peritubular capillaries by immunoperoxidase on paraffin sections (C4d score &gt;0) should be regarded as sufficient for the diagnosis of ABMR in the presence of MVI (ie, meeting criterion 3 of the classification), regardless of whether detectable DSAs are present (Table 5).</p>
        <p>We also considered possible molecular alternatives to the DSA criterion. Molecular markers, in the form of those associated with endothelial injury, were first introduced into criterion 2 of the F I G U R E 2 Three renal allograft biopsies specimens showing inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (i-IFTA) with varying densities of interstitial fibrosis and degrees of interstitial inflammation, edema, and tubulitis, using 3 different histologic stains. The biopsy specimen in A-C shows dense interstitial fibrosis but also widespread and focally heavy inflammation in the sclerotic interstitium (i-IFTA 3) with tubulitis involving several mildly to moderately atrophic tubules, up to score t3 (arrow, B). The biopsy specimen in D-F also shows dense interstitial fibrosis, but milder inflammation. Although the inflammation in D-F is fairly diffuse, this was not true in other areas of cortex with fibrosis, and the i-IFTA score on this biopsy was 2. In addition, there is only mild tubulitis (t1), and as such, this biopsy specimen did not meet criteria for chronic active T cell-mediated rejection. In the biopsy specimen in G-I, the interstitial fibrosis is focally dense and focally less so with interstitial edema, as is most evident on the trichrome stain in I. There is more variable inflammation (overall i-IFTA score was 2), although t2 tubulitis is evident in a mildly atrophic tubule (arrow, G). Active ABMR; all 3 criteria must be met for diagnosis 1. Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury, including 1 or more of the following: Microvascular inflammation (g &gt; 0 and/or ptc &gt; 0), in the absence of recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis, although in the presence of acute TCMR, borderline infiltrate, or infection, ptc ≥ 1 alone is not sufficient and g must be ≥ 1 Intimal or transmural arteritis (v &gt; 0) ABMR classification in Banff 2013. 14 Since that time, combinations of transcripts have been introduced with far greater specificity for ABMR, [17][18][19][20] to be more of a marker for ABMR than for the presence of DSAs. 31 A more specific molecular marker for ABMR is the ABMR classifier, [17][18][19][20] consisting of 30 nonredundant probes, selected from comparisons between biopsy specimens with versus those without histologic changes of ABMR. Data from Loupy et al 19 showed that adding the results of the ABMR classifier to histologic findings significantly improved their ability to diagnose ABMR, independently from C4d and DSA. Therefore, despite the limitations noted, it was thought that this classifier or a related gene set could potentially be used to satisfy criterion 3 in the diagnosis of ABMR, similar to C4d (Table 5). It should be stressed that for this to be done at any given center, the cut-off value of such molecular assessment in the diagnosis of ABMR must be independently validated at each center at this point in time. With technologies becoming available to derive the molecular assessment (classifier or gene set) from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) routine biopsy specimens, 32,33 multicenter validation should become feasible in the near future through collaborative efforts of the ongoing Banff working groups (Table 1).</p>
        <p>In Table 2 of the 2013 Banff Classification, 14 it is noted in a footnote that lesions classified as acute/active ABMR may be clinically acute, smoldering, or subclinical; this qualifier was also maintained in the 2015 revision. 1 Thus, the use of the word "acute" in the term "acute/ active ABMR" can be misleading, and it was elected to simply refer to lesions of ABMR with microvascular injury and evidence of current or recent antibody interaction with graft endothelium but without morphologic evidence of chronic vascular injury (transplant glomeru- It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR. "v" lesions and chronic allograft arteriopathy are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with ≥2 smooth muscle layers. 2 Lesions of chronic active ABMR can range from primarily active lesions with early transplant glomerulopathy (TG) evident only by EM (cg1a) to those with advanced TG and other chronic changes in addition to active microvascular inflammation. For biopsy specimens showing TG and/or peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering in the absence of evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with the endothelium (criterion 2) but with a prior documented diagnosis of active or chronic active ABMR or documented prior evidence of DSA, the term "chronic ABMR" should be applied.</p>

        <p>The clinical significance of these findings may be quite different in grafts exposed to anti-blood group antibodies (ABO-incompatible allografts), where they do not appear to be injurious to the graft and may represent accommodation. However, with anti-HLA antibodies, such lesions may progress to chronic ABMR, and more outcome data are needed.</p>
        <p>A severely atrophic tubule is defined as one with each of the following 3 features: a diameter &lt;25% of that of unaffected or minimally affected tubules on the biopsy, an undifferentiated-appearing, cuboidal or flattened epithelium, and pronounced wrinkling and/or thickening of the tubular basement membrane.</p>

In contrast with true acute ABMR, which can often be reversed by a combination of current, standard-of-care treatments aimed primarily at removing DSAs (eg, plasmapheresis, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin), 34,35 smoldering active ABMR should be a major focus for future clinical trials of novel agents designed to treat active ABMR and prevent de novo or progressing TG by mechanisms other than (or in addition to) DSA removal. In summary, the word "active" in the pathology report indicates ongoing disease activity highlighted by MVI with or without concomitant chronic remodeling (TG, PTCBML, IFTA, cv) of the allograft.</p>
        <p>Molecular diagnostics were first introduced into the Banff classification in 2013, 14 although this was limited to ABMR and its introduction was as much to encourage development of more specific and more universally applicable molecular tests as to be used in diagnosing ABMR at that time. That former goal has in fact come to fruition, and multiple groups in North America and Europe are now applying molecular diagnostics in analyzing renal allograft biopsy specimens [18][19][20] -as summarized in Tables 3 and4. Just as the 2013</p>
        <p>Banff meeting report 14 put forth recommendations regarding taking a sample of tissue from renal allograft biopsies for electron microscopy (EM) and guidelines for performing EM to detect early changes of transplant glomerulopathy (cg1a), it is now appropriate to recommend sampling of biopsy tissue for molecular studies and to provide guidelines for when such studies are likely to be helpful diagnostically (Table 6). The latter specifically include situations where a combination of histologic, immunohistologic, and serologic data remain equivocal for diagnosis of ABMR, such as when the biopsy shows microvascular inflammation (g + ptc ≥ 2) but no C4d and there are no detectable DSAs; in biopsy specimens of ABO-incompatible allografts showing (g + ptc ≥ 2) and where a positive C4d is not helpful diagnostically 36 ; and in biopsy specimens of ABO-compatible grafts where there is C4d positivity and DSA but no histologic evidence of rejection. In addition, testing for transcript sets strongly associated with TCMR 15,16,18,20 Borderline infiltrate TCMR vs no TCMR TCMR classifier 42,43 Isolated arteritis (no MVI or TCMR) C4d negative, ± DSA TCMR vs ABMR vs mixed rejection vs no rejection ABMR classifier 17,40 DSAST 31,41 TCMR Classifier 42,43 ABMR, antibody-mediated rejection; ABO, blood group antigens; cg, Banff chronic glomerulopathy score; DSA, donor-specific antibody; DSAST, donor-specific antibody specific transcript; g, Banff glomerulitis score; MVI, microvascular inflammation; ptc, Banff peritubular capillaritis score; TCMR, T cellmediated rejection; TG, transplant glomerulopathy.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that at this point no specific Banff recommendations are given regarding which molecular classifiers/transcript sets should be tested for or the platform(s) used to assess gene expression.</p>
        <p>This includes the decision whether to perform molecular studies on freshly sampled tissue or FFPE, 32,33 the latter having the advantage of being done on the same tissue used for routine histology but with possible reduced sensitivity due to RNA degradation during processing.</p>
        <p>In all cases, molecular analyses need to be validated in any individual laboratory performing such testing, and gene expression thresholds significantly associated with ABMR, TCMR, or other lesions may well be different in different laboratories using the same transcript sets and platforms. As mentioned, because there are no specific lesions for ABMR/TCMR, no specific gene would be per se relevant for discrimination these diseases. A holistic molecular approach using machine learning and classifiers has been done in recent years and has provided valuable information for improving the classification and prognostic assessment of rejection. 19,[37][38][39] As discussed, the changes made to the Banff classification in 2013 14 stimulated many studies that largely validated those changes but also led to additional modification of the classification presented in the 2015 meeting report 1 and here. Similarly, it is anticipated that the changes and recommendations made in this meeting report will serve as a stimulus for studies testing the validity of the revised diagnostic criteria for TCMR and ABMR with respect to predicting patient outcomes, as well as studies directly applying molecular diagnostics in the clinical setting along the path toward molecular consensus described in the 2015 Banff meeting report. 1 The ultimate goals are not only to improve our ability to predict graft outcomes but also to better guide therapy, including in those cases where histology and serology alone cannot optimally do so, leading to improved patient outcomes compared with the current standard of care.</p>
        <p>Are there clinical and/or pathologic features of the recurrent disease in the allograft that predict graft loss? Which pathologic analyses (IF, EM, others) are needed for optimal and early diagnosis of recurrent disease? Is the apparent association of recurrent glomerular disease with acute rejection related to biopsy bias (ie incidental discovery of recurrent disease in biopsies done to r/o rejection), under-immunosuppression, or both?</p>
        <p>See summary of Banff pre-meeting "New Endpoints for Next Generation Clinical Trials"</p>
        <p>Efforts are underway to standardize the histological assessment of HIV-associated nephropathies in native kidneys (eg, KDIGO). Any scoring of such lesions in transplants should follow the native kidney criteria. Subsequently transplant specific pathologies can be defined. Further efforts of this BWG will focus on working with the native kidney groups on standardizing the HIV-related pathology scoring.</p>
