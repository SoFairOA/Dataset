        <p>Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic crops/ crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13, 125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17, 86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more nutritious.

        <p>Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental impacts (nitrate (NO 2 3 ) leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants (4) . Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu-and S-based) crop protection products (5,6) .Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental impacts (nitrate (NO 2 3 ) leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants (4) .

        <p>As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties used (6 -10) .

        <p>Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins have been found to be either up-or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs in potato and wheat (10 -15) . Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern (10 -15) .Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins have been found to be either up-or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs in potato and wheat (10 -15) .

        <p>Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb), pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of publications).Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb), pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of publications).</p>
        <p>There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in (poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids and vitamins C and E) (16 -18) . Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio et al. (16) and Wahlqvist (17) . Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption (16 -18) .There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in (poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids and vitamins C and E) (16 -18) .

        <p>Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of crops (19 -21) . However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount of information published in the last 4 -5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods (7,19 -22) . However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues (21,23,24) .Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of crops (19 -21) .

        <p>There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1) have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of variation, which reduces the withinstudy power of unweighted analyses and the between-study power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental designs (25,26) . However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods (19) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses on a subset of the available information.There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition resulting from farming practices.

Sensitivity analyses included (1) using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http:// research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).</p>

        <p>A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a reported effect size (i.e. SMD tot ) and CI were estimated based on standard methods (35) using 'metafor' (31) . The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits, vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods), was additionally tested using mixed-effect models (36) and subgroup analyses.A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples.

        <p>For most of the minerals (including many plant marco-and micronutrients), the meta-analyses could not detect significant composition differences between organic and conventional crops (see online supplementary Table S12). However, for a small number of minerals, differences in composition were identified by both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses, which detected significantly lower concentrations of Cr and Sr (259 (95 % CI 2 147, 30) % and 2 26 (95 % CI 245, 2 6) %, respectively), but significantly higher concentrations of Mo and Rb (65 (95 % CI 26, 105) % and 82 (95 % CI 6, 157) %, respectively) in organic crops.

        <p>The results of meta-analyses of the extensive data set of 343 peer-reviewed publications indicated that organic crops and processed crop-based foods have a higher antioxidant activity and contain higher concentrations of a wide range of nutritionally desirable antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, but lower concentrations of the potentially harmful, toxic metal Cd. For plant secondary metabolites, this confirms the results of the meta-analyses carried out by Brandt et al.

However, it contradicts the results of the systematic reviews/meta-analyses by Dangour et al. (19) and Smith-Spangler et al.

The main reason for the inability of previous studies to detect composition differences was probably the highly limited number of studies/data sets available or included in analyses by these authors, which would have decreased the statistical power of the meta-analyses.The results of meta-analyses of the extensive data set of 343 peer-reviewed publications indicated that organic crops and processed crop-based foods have a higher antioxidant activity and contain higher concentrations of a wide range of nutritionally desirable antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, but lower concentrations of the potentially harmful, toxic metal Cd.

        <p>In addition, most of the previous studies did not use weighted meta-analyses based on SMD.

In the study carried out by Dangour et al.

        <p>Among the composition differences detected by the metaanalyses carried out in the present study, the higher antioxidant activity and higher concentrations of a wide range of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics found in organic crops/crop-based foods may indicate the greatest potential nutritional benefits. Based on the differences reported, results indicate that a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption would result in a 20 -40 % (and for some compounds more than 60 %) increase in crop-based antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels without a simultaneous increase in energy, which would be in line with the dietary recommendations (16,17) . This estimated magnitude of difference would be equivalent to the amount of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics present in one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant/meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these plant secondary metabolites to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption is confirmed (16 -18) .Among the composition differences detected by the metaanalyses carried out in the present study, the higher antioxidant activity and higher concentrations of a wide range of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics found in organic crops/crop-based foods may indicate the greatest potential nutritional benefits.

        <p>However, it is important to point out that there is still a lack of knowledge about the potential human health impacts of increasing antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels and switching to organic food consumption. For example, there are still gaps in the understanding of the (1) uptake, bioavailability and metabolism of (poly)phenolics after ingestion and (2) exact compounds/molecules and modes of action responsible for health benefits (16) . Also, it is important to consider that most of the human dietary intervention studies on associations between antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake and health indicators were based on the comparison of standard diets with diets in which the amount of specific (poly)phenolic-rich foods (e.g. cocoa, red wine, tea/coffee, berries, citrus and nuts) was high (16,17) .However, it is important to point out that there is still a lack of knowledge about the potential human health impacts of increasing antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels and switching to organic food consumption.

        <p>There are, to our knowledge, only two human dietary intervention studies in which contrasting antioxidant/(poly) phenolic intake levels were generated by providing diets based on conventional and organic crops; both studies focused on assessing antioxidant status in humans and were inconclusive with respect to the identification of potential health impacts of organic food consumption (21,42,43) . However, there are several animal dietary intervention studies that have identified significant associations between organic feed consumption and animal growth and physiological (including immune and endocrine) parameters and/or biomarkers of health when compared with conventional feed consumption (44,45) . Among these studies, one recent factorial animal study has gone one step further and assessed associations between contrasting crop fertilisation and crop protection protocols used in conventional and organic farming systems and (1) the composition (including (poly)phenolic content) of crops/compound feeds made from crops and (2) the growth, physiological, immunological and hormonal parameters of rats that consumed these feeds (46) . With respect to composition differences, the study yielded results similar to those of the meta-analyses carried out in the present study. For example, rat feeds produced from organic crops had lower concentrations of proteins and Cd, but higher concentrations of polyphenols and the carotenoid lutein. The study also demonstrated that composition differences were mainly linked to contrasting fertilisation regimens (green and animal manures v. mineral fertiliser inputs). The consumption of feeds made from organic crops by the rats resulted in higher levels of body protein, body ash, leucocyte count, plasma glucose, leptin, insulin-like growth factor 1, corticosterone, and IgM, and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation, but lower levels of plasma IgG, testosterone and mitogen-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes (46) . Redundancy analysis identified total polyphenol concentrations in feeds as the strongest driver for the physiological/endocrinological parameters assessed in rats. This suggests that a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption may have impacts similar to those of an increase in the intake of foods with high antioxidant/(poly) phenolic contents. This hypothesis would merit further exploration in animal and human dietary intervention studies.There are, to our knowledge, only two human dietary intervention studies in which contrasting antioxidant/(poly) phenolic intake levels were generated by providing diets based on conventional and organic crops; both studies focused on assessing antioxidant status in humans and were inconclusive with respect to the identification of potential health impacts of organic food consumption (21,42,43) .

        <p>Many of the antioxidants, including (poly)phenolics, found in higher concentrations in organic crops are known to be produced by plants in response to abiotic (e.g. wounding and heat, water and nutrient stress) and biotic (pest attacks and disease) stress and form part of the plants' constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms to pests and diseases (47 -49) . Therefore, higher concentrations of (poly)phenolics in organic crops may be due to higher incidence/severity of pest and disease damage, causing enhanced (poly)phenolic production as part of the inducible plant resistance response. The differences in antioxidant concentrations between organic and conventional crops may therefore have been due to contrasting pest and disease damage and/or fertilisation intensity. However, there are, to our knowledge, no sound published data/evidence for a causal link between higher pest/disease incidence/severity and antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that differences in fertilisation regimens between organic and conventional production systems (and, in particular, the non-use of high mineral N fertiliser inputs) are significant drivers for higher (poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops (20,49 -52) . For example, Sander &amp; Heitefuss (50) reported that increasing mineral N fertilisation resulted in reduced concentrations of phenolic resistance compounds in wheat leaves and increased severity of foliar disease (powdery mildew). Similarly, a review by Ru ¨hmann et al. (51) describes the negative correlations between N fertilisation/supply-driven shoot growth and concentrations of phenylpropanoids and apple scab resistance in young leaves in apple trees (51) . In tomato, deficiency of both N and P was found to be linked to flavonol accumulation in plant tissues (52) . More recently, Almuayrifi (49) has demonstrated that the non-use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides has no effect on phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations and profiles in wheat, but that the use of standard, conventional mineral (NPK) fertiliser regimens is associated with significantly lower phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations in wheat leaves compared with organic wheat crops fertilised with green and animal manures only. The variability in relative differences in antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations found between studies and crops may therefore at least partially be explained by variability in the fertilisation protocols in both the organic and non-organic systems compared. The finding in the present study that organic crops have significantly lower N, NO 2 3 and NO 2 2 concentrations would support the theory that differences in antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations between organic and conventional crops are driven by contrasting N supply patterns. This view is supported by previous studies that have suggested that under high N availability, plants allocate carbohydrates from photosynthesis to primary metabolism and rapid growth while producing less amounts of secondary metabolites involved in defence (51) .Many of the antioxidants, including (poly)phenolics, found in higher concentrations in organic crops are known to be produced by plants in response to abiotic (e.g. wounding and heat, water and nutrient stress) and biotic (pest attacks and disease) stress and form part of the plants' constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms to pests and diseases (47 -49) .

        <p>Cd is a highly toxic metal and one of the only three toxic metal contaminants (the other two being Pb and Hg) for which the European Commission has set maximum residue levels (MRL) in foods (53) . Cd accumulates in the human body (especially in the liver and kidneys) and therefore dietary Cd intake levels should be kept as low as possible (53) . The on average 48 % lower Cd concentrations found in organic crops/crop-based foods in the meta-analyses carried out in the present study are therefore desirable, although the exact health benefits associated with reducing Cd intake levels via a switch to organic food consumption are difficult to estimate. Similar to the results of the present study, a recent literature review by Smith-Spangler et al. (21) has also reported that of the seventy-seven comparative data sets (extracted from fifteen publications), twenty-one indicated significantly lower and only one significantly higher Cd concentrations in organic foods. Differences in Cd contamination levels between organic and conventional winter wheat have recently been shown to be mainly linked to differences in fertilisation regimens (especially the high mineral P inputs used in conventional farming systems), although contrasting rotation designs also contributed to differences in Cd concentrations between organic and conventional wheat (7) .

        <p>The present study demonstrated that the prohibition of synthetic chemical pesticide use under organic farming standards results in a more than 4-fold reduction in the number of crop samples with detectable pesticide residues. This supports previous studies that have concluded that organic food consumption can reduce exposure to pesticide residues (21 -23) . The considerably higher frequency of occurrence of detectable residues in conventional fruits (75 %) than in vegetables (32 %) may indicate higher levels of crop protection inputs being used in fruit crops, but could also have been due to the use of more persistent chemicals, different sprayer technologies used and/or pesticide applications being made closer to harvest. The finding of detectable pesticide residues in a proportion (about 11 %) of organic crop samples may have been due to cross-contamination from neighbouring conventional fields, the continued presence of very persistent pesticides (e.g. organochlorine compounds) in fields or perennial crop tissues from past conventional management, and/or accidental or fraudulent use of prohibited pesticides in organic farms.The present study demonstrated that the prohibition of synthetic chemical pesticide use under organic farming standards results in a more than 4-fold reduction in the number of crop samples with detectable pesticide residues.

        <p>Pesticide residues that are below the MRL set by the European Commission (55,56) are considered by regulators not to pose risk to consumers or the environment, as they are significantly lower than concentrations for which negative health or environmental impacts can be detected in the regulatory pesticide safety testing carried out as part of the pesticide approval process (55) . However, a significant number of crop samples included in the regulatory European Food Safety Authority pesticide residue monitoring in Europe are still found to contain pesticide residues above the MRL (57) . For example, in recent European Food Safety Authority surveys, pesticide residues above the MRL have been found in 6•2 % of spinach, 3•8 % of oat, 3•4 % of peach, 3•0 % of orange, 2•9 % of strawberry and lettuce, 2•8 % of table grape and 2•7 % of apple samples analysed (57) . There is still scientific controversy about the safety of some currently permitted pesticides (e.g. organophosphorus compounds) even at levels below the MRL and complex mixtures of pesticides, as additive/ synergistic effects of pesticide mixtures have been documented and safety testing of pesticide mixtures is currently not required as part of the regulatory pesticide approval process (58 -60) . Similar to Cd, the lower risk of exposure to pesticide residues can be considered desirable, but potential health benefits associated with reducing pesticide exposure via a switch to organic food consumption are impossible to estimate.Pesticide residues that are below the MRL set by the European Commission (55,56) are considered by regulators not to pose risk to consumers or the environment, as they are significantly lower than concentrations for which negative health or environmental impacts can be detected in the regulatory pesticide safety testing carried out as part of the pesticide approval process (55) .

        <p>It should be pointed out that (1) there are only eleven studies in which the frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues were compared, (2) eight of these studies focused on only one crop species, (3) no comparative studies for cereals, oilseeds and pulses were identified in the literature review, and (4) the data available did not allow scientifically robust comparisons of the concentrations of pesticides. Therefore, it is important to carry out further studies to improve our understanding of differences in the frequency of occurrence and concentrations of pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops.It should be pointed out that (1) there are only eleven studies in which the frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues were compared, (2) eight of these studies focused on only one crop species, (3) no comparative studies for cereals, oilseeds and pulses were identified in the literature review, and (4) the data available did not allow scientifically robust comparisons of the concentrations of pesticides.

        <p>The concentrations of proteins, amino acids and N (which are known to be positively correlated in plants) were found to be lower in organic crops, and this is consistent with the results of previous studies that have linked lower protein concentrations to lower N inputs and N availability in organic crop production systems (61,62) . The nutritional significance/relevance of slightly lower protein and amino acid concentrations in organic crops to human health is likely to be low, as European and North American diets typically provide sufficient or even excessive amounts of proteins and essential amino acids. Also, while some studies concluded that protein content in most European and North American diets is too high and that this contributes to the increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity (63) , other studies reported that increasing protein intake levels may be a strategy to prevent obesity (64) . Therefore, the lower protein and amino acid concentrations found in organic foods are unlikely to have a significant nutritional or health impact.The concentrations of proteins, amino acids and N (which are known to be positively correlated in plants) were found to be lower in organic crops, and this is consistent with the results of previous studies that have linked lower protein concentrations to lower N inputs and N availability in organic crop production systems (61,62) .

        <p>The higher NO 2 3 and NO 2 2 concentrations in conventional crops are also thought to be linked to high mineral N inputs, as both NO 2 3 and NO 2 2 are known to accumulate in plants under high-mineral N input regimens (65) . The higher NO 2 2 concentrations in conventional crops/crop-based foods are nutritionally undesirable, as they have been described to be risk factors for stomach cancer and methaemoglobinaemia in humans (65) .

        <p>One of the main challenges to interpreting comparisons of organic and inorganic food production systems is the high heterogeneity arising from combinations of (1) crops, crop types and/or crop-based foods, (2) countries, and/or (3) pedoclimatic and agronomic background conditions. As has been mentioned in previous reviews (19 -21) , pooling diverse information was necessary, because for most of the composition parameters, the number of published studies available was not sufficient to carry out separate meta-analyses for specific countries/regions and crop types and species. Consequently, heterogeneity was extremely high (I 2 . 75 %) for most of the composition parameters for which significant differences were detected. For many composition parameters, the method of synthesis did not have large effects on results, in terms of both statistical significance and the magnitude of relative difference between organic and conventional crops. This indicates that there is now a sufficiently large body of published information to identify differences that are relatively consistent across study types, crops, and pedo-climatic and agronomic environments. Therefore, for these parameters, future studies should focus on increasing our understanding of the underlying agronomic, pedo-climatic and crop genetic factors responsible for composition differences between organic and conventional crops.One of the main challenges to interpreting comparisons of organic and inorganic food production systems is the high heterogeneity arising from combinations of (1) crops, crop types and/or crop-based foods, (2) countries, and/or (3) pedoclimatic and agronomic background conditions.

        <p>For other composition parameters (e.g. ferric reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of flavonoids, stilbenes, total carotenoids, L-ascorbic acid, proteins, NO 2 2 and Cd), differences in methods had a large impact in terms of both significant effects being detected and/or estimates of the magnitude of difference based on MPD and SMD. For these compounds, additional high-quality studies (that report measures of variance) are required to increase the power of weighted meta-analyses.For other composition parameters (e.g. ferric reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of flavonoids, stilbenes, total carotenoids, L-ascorbic acid, proteins, NO 2 2 and Cd), differences in methods had a large impact in terms of both significant effects being detected and/or estimates of the magnitude of difference based on MPD and SMD.

        <p>Overall assessment of the strength of evidence for antioxidant/(poly)phenolic parameters indicated high or moderate reliability for thirteen of the nineteen parameters and moderate reliability for Cd.

        <p>In contrast to previous literature reviews (19 -21) , the larger number of studies now available allowed separate metaanalyses to be carried out for different crop types (e.g. fruits, vegetables and cereals), but only for a limited number of composition parameters. This demonstrates that there is variation between crop types with respect to (1) whether the production system has a significant effect and/or (2) the magnitude of difference between organic and conventional crops, although sample sizes remain insufficient to detect interactions between crop types in many cases.In contrast to previous literature reviews (19 -21) , the larger number of studies now available allowed separate metaanalyses to be carried out for different crop types (e.g. fruits, vegetables and cereals), but only for a limited number of composition parameters.

        <p>The present study also identified variation between studies (1) carried out in countries with different pedo-climatic conditions and agronomic protocols (e.g. rotation designs, irrigated or non-irrigated crop production, and level and type of animal manures used) and/or (2) focused on different crop species. This is not surprising as both genetic and environmental/agronomic factors are known to affect the concentrations of N, NO 2 3 , NO 2 2 , proteins, sugars, antioxidants/ (poly)phenolics, Cd and pesticides in crops (7,9 -12,20,47 -52,62) .

        <p>The unweighted MPD were calculated to provide an estimate of the magnitude of difference that is meaningful when considering nutritional/health impacts of changes in crop composition.

        <p>However, there is now evidence from a large number of quality studies that consistently show that organic production systems result in crops/crop-based compound foods with higher concentrations of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and lower concentrations of Cd and pesticide residues compared with conventional production systems.

Also, in many studies, there was a lack of detailed information on (1) the geographical origin of samples in retail surveys and ( 2) agronomic (e.g. rotation, fertilisation, tillage and irrigation regimens), pedo-climatic and crop genetic backgrounds (in farm surveys and field experiments), which would allow potential sources of variation to be investigated.The present study identified deficiencies in a large proportion of the published studies.

However, they concluded that the currently available data do not allow clear trends with respect to health markers and outcomes to be identified.
