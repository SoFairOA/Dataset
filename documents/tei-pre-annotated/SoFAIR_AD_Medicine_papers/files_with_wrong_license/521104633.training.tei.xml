        <p>The number of older people, including those living with dementia, is rising, as younger age mortality declines. However, the age-specific incidence of dementia has fallen in many countries, probably because of improvements in education, nutrition, health care, and lifestyle changes. Overall, a growing body of evidence supports the nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia modelled by the 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care: less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact. We now add three more risk factors for dementia with newer, convincing evidence. These factors are excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and air pollution. We have completed new reviews and meta-analyses and incorporated these into an updated 12 risk factor life-course model of dementia prevention. Together the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of worldwide dementias, which consequently could theo retically be prevented or delayed. The potential for prevention is high and might be higher in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) where more dementias occur.The number of older people, including those living with dementia, is rising, as younger age mortality declines.

        <p>Our new life-course model and evidence synthesis has paramount worldwide policy implications. It is never too early and never too late in the life course for dementia prevention. Early-life (younger than 45 years) risks, such as less education, affect cognitive reserve; midlife (45-65 years), and later-life (older than 65 years) risk factors influence reserve and triggering of neuropathological developments. Culture, poverty, and inequality are key drivers of the need for change. Individuals who are most deprived need these changes the most and will derive the highest benefit.Our new life-course model and evidence synthesis has paramount worldwide policy implications.

        <p>Policy should prioritise childhood education for all. Public health initiatives minimising head injury and decreasing harmful alcohol drinking could potentially reduce young-onset and later-life dementia. Midlife systolic blood pressure control should aim for 130 mm Hg or lower to delay or prevent dementia. Stopping smoking, even in later life, ameliorates this risk. Passive smoking is a less considered modifiable risk factor for dementia. Many countries have restricted this exposure. Policy makers should expedite improvements in air quality, particularly in areas with high air pollution.Policy should prioritise childhood education for all.

        <p>We recommend keeping cognitively, physically, and socially active in midlife and later life although little evidence exists for any single specific activity protecting against dementia. Using hearing aids appears to reduce the excess risk from hearing loss. Sustained exercise in midlife, and possibly later life, protects from dementia, perhaps through decreasing obesity, diabetes, and cardio vascular risk. Depression might be a risk for dementia, but in later life dementia might cause depression. Although behaviour change is difficult and some associations might not be purely causal, individuals have a huge potential to reduce their dementia risk.We recommend keeping cognitively, physically, and socially active in midlife and later life although little evidence exists for any single specific activity protecting against dementia.

        <p>Wellbeing is the goal of much of dementia care. People with dementia have complex problems and symptoms in many domains. Interventions should be individualised and consider the person as a whole, as well as their family carers. Evidence is accumulating for the effectiveness, at least in the short term, of psychosocial interventions tailored to the patient's needs, to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms. Evidence-based interventions for carers can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms over years and be cost-effective.Wellbeing is the goal of much of dementia care.

        <p>Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition. People with dementia have more physical health problems than others of the same age but often receive less community health care and find it particularly difficult to access and organise care.

They have died disproportionately in the COVID-19 epidemic. Hospitalisations are distressing and are associated with poor outcomes and high costs.

        <p>Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, and this number is projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, 1 rising particularly in low-income and middleincome countries (LMIC) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. 1 Dementia affects individuals, their families, and the economy, with global costs estimated at about US$1 trillion annually. 1 We reconvened the 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care 2 to identify the evidence for advances likely to have the greatest impact since our 2017 paper and build on its work.

        <p>• Prevention is about policy and individuals. Contributions to the risk and mitigation of dementia begin early and continue throughout life, so it is never too early or too late. These actions require both public health programmes and individually tailored interventions. In addition to population strategies, policy should address high-risk groups to increase social, cognitive, and physical activity; and vascular health. • Specific actions for risk factors across the life course• Prevention is about policy and individuals.

        <p>• Aim to maintain systolic BP of 130 mm Hg or less in midlife from around age 40 years (antihypertensive treatment for hypertension is the only known effective preventive medication for dementia). • Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss and reduce hearing loss by protection of ears from excessive noise exposure. • Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke. • Prevent head injury.• Aim to maintain systolic BP of 130 mm Hg or less in midlife from around age 40 years (antihypertensive treatment for hypertension is the only known effective preventive medication for dementia). • Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss and reduce hearing loss by protection of ears from excessive noise exposure. • Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke. • Prevent head injury.</p>
        <p>• Limit alcohol use, as alcohol misuse and drinking more than 21 units weekly increase the risk of dementia. • Avoid smoking uptake and support smoking cessation to stop smoking, as this reduces the risk of dementia even in later life. • Provide all children with primary and secondary education.• Limit alcohol use, as alcohol misuse and drinking more than 21 units weekly increase the risk of dementia. • Avoid smoking uptake and support smoking cessation to stop smoking, as this reduces the risk of dementia even in later life. • Provide all children with primary and secondary education.</p>

        <p>• Many risk factors cluster around inequalities, which occur particularly in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups and in vulnerable populations. Tackling these factors will involve not only health promotion but also societal action to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives. Examples include creating environments that have physical activity as a norm, reducing the population profile of blood pressure rising with age through better patterns of nutrition, and reducing potential excessive noise exposure. • Dementia is rising more in low-income and middleincome countries (LMIC) than in high-income countries, because of population ageing and higher frequency of potentially modifiable risk factors. Preventative interventions might yield the largest dementia reductions in LMIC.• Many risk factors cluster around inequalities, which occur particularly in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups and in vulnerable populations.

        <p>• Provide holistic post-diagnostic care • Post-diagnostic care for people with dementia should address physical and mental health, social care, and support. Most people with dementia have other illnesses and might struggle to look after their health and this might result in potentially preventable hospitalisations. summarised best evidence using, where possible, goodquality systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or individual studies, where these add important knowledge to the field. We performed systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses where needed to generate new evidence for our analysis of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Within this framework, we present a narrative synthesis of evidence including systematic reviews and meta-analyses and explain its balance, strengths, and limitations. We evaluated new evidence on dementia risk in LMIC; risks and protective factors for dementia; detection of Alzheimer's disease; multimorbidity in dementia; and interventions for people affected by dementia. Nearly all the evidence is from studies in highincome countries (HIC), so risks might differ in other countries and interventions might require modification for different cultures and environments. This notion also underpins the critical need to understand the dementias related to life-course disadvantage-whether in HICs or LMICs.• Provide holistic post-diagnostic care • Post-diagnostic care for people with dementia should address physical and mental health, social care, and support.

        <p>Our understanding of dementia aetiology is shifting. A consensus group, for example, has described hippocampal sclerosis associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy, as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) dementia, usually found in people older than 80 years, progressing more slowly than Alzheimer's disease, detectable at post-mortem, often mimicking or comorbid with Alzheimer's disease. 3 This situation reflects increasing attention as to how clinical syndromes are and are not related to particular underlying pathologies and how this might change across age. More work is needed, however, before LATE can be used as a valid clinical diagnosis.Our understanding of dementia aetiology is shifting.

        <p>The fastest growing demographic group in HIC is the oldest adults, those aged over 90 years. Thus a unique opportunity exists to focus on both human biology, in this previously rare population, as well as on meeting their needs and promoting their wellbeing.The fastest growing demographic group in HIC is the oldest adults, those aged over 90 years.

        <p>The number of people with dementia is rising. Predictions about future trends in dementia prevalence vary depending on the underlying assumptions and geographical region, but generally suggest substantial increases in overall prevalence related to an ageing population. For example, according to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, the global age-standardised prevalence of dementia between 1990 and 2016 was relatively stable, but with an ageing and bigger population the number of people with dementia has more than doubled since 1990. 4 However, in many HIC such as the USA, the UK, and France, age-specific incidence rates are lower in more recent cohorts compared with cohorts from previous decades collected using similar methods and target populations 5 (figure 1) and the age-specific incidence of dementia appears to decrease. 6 All-cause dementia incidence is lower in people born more recently, 7 proba bly due to educational, socio-economic, health care, and lifestyle changes. 2,5 However, in these countries increasing obesity and diabetes and declining physical activity might reverse this trajectory. 8,9 In contrast, age-specific dementia prevalence in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan looks as if it is increasing, as is Alzheimer's in LMIC, although whether diagnostic methods are always the same in comparison studies is unclear. [5][6][7] Modelling of the UK change suggests a 57% increase in the number of people with dementia from 2016 to 2040, 70% of that expected if age-specific incidence rates remained steady, 10 such that by 2040 there will be 1•2 million UK people with dementia. Models also suggest that there will be future increases both in the number of individuals who are independent and those with complex care needs.The number of people with dementia is rising.

        <p>Figure 2 summarises possible mechanisms of protection from dementia, some of which involve increasing or maintaining cognitive reserve despite pathology and neuropathological damage. There are different terms describing the observed differential susceptibility to agerelated and disease-related changes and these are not used consistently. 15,16 A consensus paper defines reserve as a concept accounting for the difference between an individual's clinical picture and their neuropathology. It, divides the concept further into neurobiological brain reserve (eg, numbers of neurones and synapses at a given timepoint), brain maintenance (as neurobiological capital at any timepoint, based on genetics or lifestyle reducing brain changes and pathology development over time) and cognitive reserve as adaptability enabling preser vation of cognition or everyday functioning in spite of brain pathology. 15 Cognitive reserve is changeable and quantifying it uses proxy measures such as education, occupational complexity, leisure activity, residual approaches (the variance of cognition not explained by demographic variables and brain measures), or identification of functional networks that might underlie such reserve. [15][16][17][18][19][20] Early-life factors, such as less education, affect the resulting cognitive reserve. Midlife and old-age risk factors influence age-related cognitive decline and triggering of neuropathological developments. Consistent with the hypothesis of cognitive reserve is that older women are more likely to develop dementia than men of the same age, probably partly because on average older women have had less education than older men. Cognitive reserve mechanisms might include preserved metabolism or increased connectivity in temporal and frontal brain areas. [17][18][19][20][21] People in otherwise good physical health can sustain a higher burden of neuropathology without cognitive impairment. 22 Culture, poverty, and inequality are important obstacles to, and drivers of, the need for change to cognitive reserve. Those who are most deprived need these changes the most and will derive the highest benefit from them.Figure 2 summarises possible mechanisms of protection from dementia, some of which involve increasing or maintaining cognitive reserve despite pathology and neuropathological damage.

        <p>Numbers of people with dementia in LMIC are rising faster than in HIC because of increases in life expectancy and greater risk factor burden. We previously calculated that nine potentially modifiable risk factors together are associated with 35% of the population attributable fraction (PAFs) of dementia worldwide: less education, high blood pressure, obesity, hearing loss, depression, diabetes, physical inactivity, smoking, and social isolation, assuming causation. 2 Most research data for this calcu lation came from HIC and there is a relative absence of specific evidence of the impact of risk factors on dementia risk in LMIC, particularly from Africa and Latin America. 27 Calculations considering country-specific prevalence of the nine potentially modifiable risk factors indicate PAF of 40% in China, 41% in India and 56% in Latin America with the potential for these numbers to be even higher depending on which estimates of risk factor frequency are used. 28,29 Therefore a higher potential for dementia prevention exists in these countries than in global estimates that use data predominantly from HIC. If not currently in place, national policies addressing access to education, causes and management of high blood pressure, causes and treatment of hearing loss, socioeconomic and commercial drivers of obesity, could be implemented to reduce risk in many countries. The higher social contact observed in the three LMIC regions provides potential insights for HIC on how to influence this risk factor for dementia. 30 We could not consider other risk factors such as poor health in pregnancy of malnourished mothers, difficult births, early life malnutrition, survival with heavy infection burdens alongside malaria and HIV, all of which might add to the risks in LMIC.Numbers of people with dementia in LMIC are rising faster than in HIC because of increases in life expectancy and greater risk factor burden.

        <p>Risk factors in early life (education), midlife (hypertension, obesity, hearing loss, TBI, and alcohol misuse) and later life (smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, and air pollution) can contribute to increased dementia risk (table 1). Good evidence exists for all these risk factors although some late-life factors, such as depression, possibly have a bidirectional impact and are also part of the dementia prodrome. 33,34 In the next section, we briefly describe relevant newly published and illustrative research studies that add to the 2017 Commission's evidence base, including risks and, for some, mitigation. We have chosen studies that are large and representative of the populations, or smaller studies in areas where very little evidence exists. We discuss them in life-course order and within the life course in the order of magnitude of population attributable factor.Risk factors in early life (education), midlife (hypertension, obesity, hearing loss, TBI, and alcohol misuse) and later life (smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, and air pollution) can contribute to increased dementia risk (table 1).

        <p>Higher childhood education levels and lifelong higher educational attainment reduce dementia risk. 2, [35][36][37] New work suggests overall cognitive ability increases, with education, before reaching a plateau in late adolescence, when brain reaches greatest plasticity; with relatively few further gains with education after age 20 years. 38 This suggests cognitive stimulation is more important in early life; much of the apparent later effect might be due to people of higher cognitive function seeking out cognitively stimulating activities and education. 38 It is difficult to separate out the specific impact of education from the effect of overall cognitive ability, 38,39 and the specific impact of later-life cognitive activity from lifelong cognitive function and activity. 39,40 Cognitive maintenance One large study in China tried to separate cognitive activity in adulthood from activities for those with more education, by considering activities judged to appeal to people of different levels of education. 40 It found people older than 65 years who read, played games, or bet more frequently had reduced risk of dementia (n=15 882, odds ratio [OR]=0•7, 95% CI 0•6-0•8). The study excluded people developing dementia less than 3 years after baseline to reduce reverse causation. This finding is consistent with small studies of midlife activities which find them associated with better late-life cognition; so for example, in 205 people aged 30-64 years, followed up until 66-88 years, travel, social outings, playing music, art, physical activity, reading, and speaking a second language, were associated with maintaining cognition, independent of education, occupation, late-life activities, and current structural brain health. 41 Similarly, engaging in intellectual activity as adults, particularly problem solving, for 498 people born in 1936, was associated with cognitive ability acquisition, although not the speed of decline. 42Higher childhood education levels and lifelong higher educational attainment reduce dementia risk. 2, [35][36][37] New work suggests overall cognitive ability increases, with education, before reaching a plateau in late adolescence, when brain reaches greatest plasticity; with relatively few further gains with education after age 20 years. 38 This suggests cognitive stimulation is more important in early life; much of the apparent later effect might be due to people of higher cognitive function seeking out cognitively stimulating activities and education. 38 It is difficult to separate out the specific impact of education from the effect of overall cognitive ability, 38,39 and the specific impact of later-life cognitive activity from lifelong cognitive function and activity. 39,40 Cognitive maintenance One large study in China tried to separate cognitive activity in adulthood from activities for those with more education, by considering activities judged to appeal to people of different levels of education. 40 It found people older than 65 years who read, played games, or bet more frequently had reduced risk of dementia (n=15 882, odds ratio [OR]=0•7, 95% CI 0•6-0•8).

        <p>The US and Puerto Rico Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) in 9361 hypertensive adults aged 50 years and older, was stopped early because of significantly fewer cardiovascular events and deaths occurring in the intensive treatment arm (aiming for systolic &lt;120 mm Hg, n=4678) in comparison with standard treatment (systolic &lt;140 mm Hg, n=4683). 78 Cognitive assessment continued after stopping the trial intervention in SPRINT MIND. 79 In the intensive compared with the standard treatment group, there were 7•2 dementia cases as opposed to 8•6 cases per 1000 person-years (HR 0•8; 95% CI 0•7-1•0) within on average 2 years from the end of the intervention period and 5 years after baseline. Pre-specified secondary outcomes were also reduced in the intensive arm for mild cog nitive impair ment (14•6 vs 18•3 cases per 1000 personyears; HR 0•8, 95% CI 0•7-1•0), combined mild cognitive impairment or dementia (20•2 vs 24•1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR 0•9, 95% CI 0•7-1•0) 79 making this the first trial to suggest reduction of risk for mild cognitive impairment. Those who were lost to follow-up were at greater risk of dementia than those who continued but follow-up rates did not differ according to intervention group. 80 Four meta-analyses of blood pressure medications to lower high blood pressure with six studies overlap have provided combined estimates of effects. All metaanalyses suggest reduced dementia in those in the interventions arms for outcomes of any dementia as well as clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. The first included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any drug to lower blood pressure and reported a reduction in risk of around 10% at marginal significance (RR 0•9, 95% CI 0•9-1•0). 81 Meta-regression showed risk lowered more if the achieved systolic pressure differential was larger between the intervention and control group. The second included 15 trials and observational studies of diuretics involving 52 599 people (median age 76 years) with 6•1 years median follow-up (dementia HR 0•8, 95% CI 0•8-0•9 and Alzheimer's disease 0•8, 0•7-0•9). 82 The third included used individual participant data from six observational studies; (dementia 0•9, 0•8-1•0 and Alzheimer's disease 0•8, 0•7-1•0; figure 4). 83 The fourth focused on people prescribed calcium channel blocker only, included 10 RCTs and observational studies comprising 75 239 hypertensive older adults (median age 72 years, median follow-up 8•2 years) found lowered dementia risk (RR 0•7, 95% CI 0•6-0•9). 84 A 2019 metaanalysis addressing which class of anti-hypertensive drug to use to lower risk of either incident dementia or cognitive decline, found over 50 000 participants in 27 studies and reported no consistent difference in effect according to which class of drug was used. 85 A Cochrane review reported good evidence that statins given to older people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. 86 One RCT found 100 mg aspirin versus placebo in 19 114 healthy adults older than 65 years did not reduce dementia (HR 1•0, 95% CI 0•8-1•2), death, physical disability, or cardiovascular disease over a period of 4•7 years. 87The US and Puerto Rico Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) in 9361 hypertensive adults aged 50 years and older, was stopped early because of significantly fewer cardiovascular events and deaths occurring in the intensive treatment arm (aiming for systolic &lt;120 mm Hg, n=4678) in comparison with standard treatment (systolic &lt;140 mm Hg, n=4683). 78 Cognitive assessment continued after stopping the trial intervention in SPRINT MIND. 79 In the intensive compared with the standard treatment group, there were 7•2 dementia cases as opposed to 8•6 cases per 1000 person-years (HR 0•8; 95% CI 0•7-1•0) within on average 2 years from the end of the intervention period and 5 years after baseline. Pre-specified secondary outcomes were also reduced in the intensive arm for mild cog nitive impair ment (14•6 vs 18•3 cases per 1000 personyears; HR 0•8, 95% CI 0•7-1•0), combined mild cognitive impairment or dementia (20•2 vs 24•1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR 0•9, 95% CI 0•7-1•0) 79 making this the first trial to suggest reduction of risk for mild cognitive impairment. Those who were lost to follow-up were at greater risk of dementia than those who continued but follow-up rates did not differ according to intervention group. 80 Four meta-analyses of blood pressure medications to lower high blood pressure with six studies overlap have provided combined estimates of effects.

        <p>Since the 2017 Commission several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been published with three high quality meta-analyses which we include. The first included 39 RCTs with an unclear total number of participants examining moderate or vigorous exercise of any frequency lasting 45-60 min per session in cognitively normal adults aged older than 50 years. This analysis reported global cognitive improvements (standard mean difference [SMD]=0•3, 95% CI 0•2-0•4) for moderate or vigorous resistance (13 studies) or aerobic exercise (18 studies) lasting 45-60 min per session with no difference between them but no effect found for yoga. 93 A second meta-analysis of RCTs in people with mild cognitive impairment found global cognition improved in the intervention group (0•3, 0•1-0•5) with aerobic exercise having a higher effect (0•6, 0•5-0•6). 94 This study did not have dementia as an outcome measure. A third meta-analysis of RCTs of longer term exercise found five studies (four lasting 12 months and one 24 months) with 2878 participants with normal baseline cognition. 95 The incidence of dementia was 3•7% (n=949) for exercisers and 6•1% (n=1017) for controls (random effect RR 0•6, 95% CI 0•3-1•1; fixed effect as no evidence of heterogeneity 0•7, 0•4-1•0). The authors concluded that the study showed no significant effect of exercise for reducing dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or clini cally significant cognitive decline but was underpowered. WHO guidelines have been published since the 2017 Commission, suggesting specific activity levels drawing on these, and one further systematic review which considered sex differences on the effect of exercise. 96,97 It concluded the evidence points towards physical activity having a small, beneficial effect on normal cognition, with a possible effect in mild cognitive impairment, mostly due to aerobic exercise. 97 Evidence about the effect of specific types of exercise, such as progressive muscle resistance training, on dementia risk is scarce.Since the 2017 Commission several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been published with three high quality meta-analyses which we include.

        <p>In the 2017 Commission we reported on diabetes as a risk factor for dementia. Distinguishing between treated and untreated diabetes as a risk factor for dementia is challenging in observational studies. In a pooled metaanalysis from over 2•3 million individuals with type 2 diabetes across 14 cohort studies, including 102 174 with dementia, diabetes was associated with an increased risk of any dementia (RR 1•6, 95% CI 1•5-1•8 for women and 1•6, 1•4-1•8 for men). 98 The risk of dementia increased with the duration and severity of diabetes. The effect of different diabetic medications on cognition or dementia outcomes remains unclear as few studies have investigated this area. 99 However, one meta-analysis of cohort studies of diabetes reported that, cross sectionally, people with diabetes taking metformin had lower prevalence of cognitive impairment (three studies OR 0•6, 95% CI 0•4-0•8) and, longitudinally, reduced dementia incidence (six studies HR 0•8, 95% CI 0•4-0•9) compared with those taking other medications or no medication. 100 However another analysis did not find a protective effect of metformin for incident dementia (three studies, RR 1•1, 95% CI 0•5-2•4) with possible harm with insulin therapy (1•2, 1•1-1•4); but this did not account for severity of diabetes of those with type 2 diabetes on insulin. 99 A Cochrane review reported intensive compared to standard diabetes control trials with 5 year follow up (n=11 140), showing no impact on cognitive decline (1•0, 95% CI 0•9-1•1) or dementia (1•3, 0•9-1•9). 101 Overall type 2 diabetes is a clear risk factor for development of future dementia; however, whether any particular medication ameliorates this risk is unclear.

This does not take into account the combinations and contexts in which risk occurs. A UK study of 7899 people aged 50 years followed up for 25 years, calculated a cardiovascular health score based on four behaviour-related (smoking, diet, physical activity, BMI) and three biological (fasting glucose, blood cholesterol, blood pressure) metrics each coded on a three-point scale (0, 1, 2). 100 A better score was associated with a lower risk of dementia (HR 0•9, 95% CI 0•9-1•0 per 1 point scale increment), for both behaviour-related (HR/1 point increment in subscales 0•9, 95% CI 0•8-0•9) and biological subscales (0•9, 0•8-1•0), main tained in people free of cardiovascular disease over the follow-up (0•9, 95% CI 0•8-1•0). These authors also reported an association of the score on the scale with hippocampal atrophy and total brain volume but not white matter hyperintensities.

        <p>Depression is associated with dementia incidence, with a variety of possible psychological or physiological mechanisms. It is also part of the prodrome and early stages of dementia. Reverse causation is possible whereby depressive symptoms result from dementia neuropathology that occurs years before clinical dementia onset. These explanations are not mutually exclusive. As in diabetes, few studies considering depression as a risk factor for dementia have distinguished between treated and untreated depression. In a meta-analysis of 32 studies, with 62 598 participants, with follow-up from 2 to 17 years, a depressive episode was a risk factor for dementia (pooled effect size 2•0, 95% CI 1•7-2•3). 116 Meta-regression analysis revealed a non-significant trend for the association between depression and incident dementia to be weaker when the length of follow-up was longer. The Norwegian HUNT study, suggested that symptoms of psychological distress predicted dementia 25 years later however with wide bounds of uncertainty (HR 1•3, 95% CI 1•0-1•7). 89 Two further studies differentiate between late-life and earlier life depressive symptoms. The UK Whitehall study, in a follow-up of 10 189 people, reports that in late life these symptoms increase dementia risk but not at younger ages (follow-up 11 years HR 1•7; 95% CI 1•2-2•4; follow-up 22 years 1•0, 0•7-1•4). 34,117 A 14-year longitudinal study of 4922 initially cognitively healthy men, aged 71-89 years, found depression was associated with 1•5 (95% CI 1•2-2•0) times the incidence of dementia but this association was accounted for by people developing dementia within 5 years of depression. 118 The use of antidepressants did not decrease this risk.Depression is associated with dementia incidence, with a variety of possible psychological or physiological mechanisms. It is also part of the prodrome and early stages of dementia. Reverse causation is possible whereby depressive symptoms result from dementia neuropathology that occurs years before clinical dementia onset. These explanations are not mutually exclusive. As in diabetes, few studies considering depression as a risk factor for dementia have distinguished between treated and untreated depression. In a meta-analysis of 32 studies, with 62 598 participants, with follow-up from 2 to 17 years, a depressive episode was a risk factor for dementia (pooled effect size 2•0, 95% CI 1•7-2•3). 116 Meta-regression analysis revealed a non-significant trend for the association between depression and incident dementia to be weaker when the length of follow-up was longer.

        <p>A study of 755 people with mild cognitive impairment and with a history of depression from the Australian longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, considered the effect of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, such as citalopram, known to reduce amyloid plaque generation and plaque formation in animal models. 119 The study found that more than 4 years of such treatment was associated with delayed progres sion to clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. People treated with antidepressants seem likely to differ from those who are not treated. Thus, the question of whether antidepressant treatment mitigates dementia risk remains open.A study of 755 people with mild cognitive impairment and with a history of depression from the Australian longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, considered the effect of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, such as citalopram, known to reduce amyloid plaque generation and plaque formation in animal models. 119 The study found that more than 4 years of such treatment was associated with delayed progres sion to clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease.

        <p>Social contact, now an accepted protective factor, enhances cognitive reserve or encourages beneficial behaviours, although isolation might also occur as part of the dementia prodrome. Several studies suggest that less social contact increases the risk of dementia. Although most people in mid and later life are married, by the time they reach older age, disproportionate numbers of women are widowed as they outlive their husbands, thus reducing their social contact. In these generations, marital status is therefore an important contributor to social engagement. Additionally, most marriages are in the relatively young, and married people usually have more interpersonal contact than do single people-this gives a long-term estimate of the effect of social contact. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 812 047 people worldwide found dementia risk to be elevated in lifelong single (RR 1•4, 95% CI 1•1-1•9) and widowed people (1•2, 1•0-1•4), compared with married people and the association was consistent in different sociocultural settings. 120 Studies adjusted for sex and we do not know if a differential risk between men and women exists. Differences persisted in studies that adjusted for education and physical health so might be attributable to married people having more social contact, rather than solely because they tend to have better physical health and more education, although residual confounding is possible. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 longitudinal cohort studies of social isolation and cognition included 102 035 participants aged 50 or more years at baseline, with follow-up of 2-21 years. 121 High social contact (measured through either or both of social activity and social network) was associated with better late-life cognitive function (r=0•05, 95% CI: 0•04-0•065) and no differences according to sex or length of time followed up.Social contact, now an accepted protective factor, enhances cognitive reserve or encourages beneficial behaviours, although isolation might also occur as part of the dementia prodrome.

        <p>A UK 28-year follow-up study of 10 308 people found that more frequent social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower dementia risk over 15 years of follow-up (HR for one standard deviation social contact frequency 0•9, 95% CI 0•8-1•0). This finding suggests more frequent social contact during late middle age is associated with a modest reduction in dementia risk, independent of socio-economic and other life style factors. 123 A Japanese longitudinal cohort study of 13 984 adults aged older than 65 years with a mean of 10 years follow-up calculated a five-point social contact scale based on: marital status; exchanging support with family members; having contact with friends; participating in community groups; and engaging in paid work. It found the score to be linearly associated with reduced dementia risk; those who scored highest on the five-point scale were 46% less likely to develop incident dementia compared with those in the lowest category. 124 Despite clear cultural variation in the meaning and perception of social isolation, findings of protective effect of more social contact are largely consistent in different settings and for either sex across the studies and metaanalyses. 118,120,121A UK 28-year follow-up study of 10 308 people found that more frequent social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower dementia risk over 15 years of follow-up (HR for one standard deviation social contact frequency 0•9, 95% CI 0•8-1•0).

        <p>Mechanisms by which sleep might affect dementia remain unclear, but sleep disturbance has been linked with β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, 131,132 reduced glymphatic clearance pathways activation, 133 low grade inflammation, increased Tau, hypoxia 132,134 and cardiovascular disease. 135 Sleep disturbance is hypothesised to increase inflammation which raises Aβ burden, leading to Alzheimer's disease and further sleep disturbance. 136 Two meta-analyses showed similar findings. The first was a synthesis of longitudinal studies with an average of 9•5 years follow-up and the second reported crosssectional and prospective cohort studies of mixed quality with different methods of measuring sleep. Sleep disturbances were defined broadly, often self-reported and including short and long sleep duration, poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm abnormality, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnoea. All these disturbances were associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia (RR 1•2; 95% CI 1•1-1•3) 137 and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (1•6, 1•3-1•9) compared with no sleep disturbance, although not all cohort studies excluded those with cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline from their analyses. 138 A U-shaped association has been reported between sleep duration and risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia with higher risks of dementia with less than 5 hours (HR=2•6; 95% CI 1•4-5•1) compared with more than 5 and less than 7 and more than 10 hours sleep (2•2, 1•4-3•5) and risks for allcause dementia and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease being similar. 135,[139][140][141] The postulated mechanisms of reduced sleep leading to accumulation of Alzheimer's type pathology is inconsistent with the evidence that both more sleep and less sleep are associated with increased risk of dementia. New onset late-life sleep disturbance, a few years before clinical dementia, might be part of the natural history of the dementia syndrome, appearing to be a risk factor, or reflect other disorders, for example, mood disturbances or cardiovascular disease. 135,142 Hypnotic use might increase risks although this is unclear and a 2018 study 139 suggests that findings of a connection were related to reverse causality and confounders. 143 When benzodiazepine use was considered, in one study, sleep length was no longer significant 139 but not in all studies. 135 Those taking hypnotics were at greater risk of dementia than those who did not regardless of sleep duration. 139 Medication for sleep disturbance might be harmful and benzodiazepines are associated with falls, hospital admissions, and possibly dementia. 139,144Mechanisms by which sleep might affect dementia remain unclear, but sleep disturbance has been linked with β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, 131,132 reduced glymphatic clearance pathways activation, 133 low grade inflammation, increased Tau, hypoxia 132,134 and cardiovascular disease. 135 Sleep disturbance is hypothesised to increase inflammation which raises Aβ burden, leading to Alzheimer's disease and further sleep disturbance. 136 Two meta-analyses showed similar findings.

        <p>Nutrition and dietary components are challenging to research with controversies still raging around the role of many micronutrients and health outcomes in dementia. Observational studies have focused on individual components ranging from folate and B vitamins, Vitamin C, D, E, and selenium amongst others as potential protective factors. 88 There has been a move towards considering the evidence base for whole diets in the last 5 years, particularly high plant intake such as in the Mediterranean diet (high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, cereals, and olive oil; low intake of saturated lipids and meat) or the similar Nordic diet, rather than individual nutrients, which might reduce cognitive decline and dementia. 145 One example is a longitudinal cohort study of 960 partici pants, ages 58-99 years, in which those reporting the highest intake of green leafy vegetables, equivalent to 1•3 servings per day, had less cognitive decline over 4•7 years than those reporting the lowest intake (β=0•05 standardised units 95% CI 0•02-0•07). 146 The authors report this difference as being equivalent to being 11 years younger. A further prospective cohort study with three midlife dietary assessments in 8255 people, followed up for a mean of nearly 25 years, found neither healthy dietary pattern nor Mediterranean diet protected from dementia, except in those with cardiovascular disease, suggesting that diet might influence dementia risk by protecting from the excess risk of cardiovascular risk factors. 147Nutrition and dietary components are challenging to research with controversies still raging around the role of many micronutrients and health outcomes in dementia.

        <p>A 2019 systematic review synthesised observational studies, finding consistently increased risk of dementia from air pollution, but heterogeneous comparator groups precluded meta-analysis. 24 We updated the search, using the same search terms and searching MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from Sept 20, 2018, (the end date of the last search) to Oct 22, 2019. We included longitudinal studies with assessment of all cause air pollution exposure; use of formal assessment of cognitive function at baseline; report of incident all-cause dementia, data from adults (age ≥18 years); and a minimum follow-up of 6 months. As meta-analysis was not possible, we used data from the only study of allcause air pollution with the outcome of all-cause dementia, with low-moderate risk of bias. This population-based, observational cohort was from Canada, where pollutant concentrations are among the lowest in the world and examined 2 066 639 people, with a mean baseline age of 67 years. 174 We calculated the RR of dementia for those in the three highest quartiles compared to the lowest was 1•09 (1•07-1•11). The attributable fraction for exposure to the highest three quartiles versus the lowest quartile of PM 2•5 and NO 2 was 6•1% (4•8-7•5). The weighted PAF was 2•3.

        <p>This Commission is the most comprehensive ana lysis to date and updates the 2017 Commission with emerging risk factor evidence convincing enough to calculate PAF for potentially reversible risk factors. We reviewed the literature systematically for the chosen risk factors and provided illustrative new literature to update our synthesis and identify data to calculate communality. We find a hopeful picture with an estimate of around 40% of all cases of dementia being associated with 12 potentially modifiable risk factors.This Commission is the most comprehensive ana lysis to date and updates the 2017 Commission with emerging risk factor evidence convincing enough to calculate PAF for potentially reversible risk factors.

        <p>We have made assumptions to calculate this new model. We used global figures for dementia risk although we know the risk factors prevalence varies between countries and most global research is from HIC, so LMIC are under-represented because of lack of data. We have assumed a causal relationship between risk factors and dementia, although we have been cautious and not included risk factors with less good evidence. No single database exists with all 12 risk factors together, but we found 11 of the factors in a UK database and used the mean figure for communality calculations for TBI. We calculated communality for the other 11. We do not know how far findings of communality in other geographical populations might differ, or in those with a differing distribution of age groups or sex. We found that social isolation was not explicitly measured and had to use proxies, such as cohabitation when considering prevalence, which are approximate.We have made assumptions to calculate this new model.

        <p>Specifically, evidence for the association of alcohol misuse with dementia comes from HIC and future studies from LMIC are needed to complete the picture. Exposure to air pollution changes over a lifetime and is inextricably linked to poverty and deprivation. However, the effects on animal models suggests specific physiological effects over and above those driven by life-course deprivation. We also considered the overlap with education for this and other risk factors and the correction for education, strongly inversely linked to deprivation, will address at least some of the confounding. However, the results in one study which reported the effect of air pollution on incident dementia showed very little difference in estimates before and after adjustment for education and other risk factors, suggesting little residual confounding exists. 174 We were also unable to metaanalyse data on pollution and thus unlike the other relative risks, the figure comes from only one study, from an area of low pollution so is likely to be an underestimate.Specifically, evidence for the association of alcohol misuse with dementia comes from HIC and future studies from LMIC are needed to complete the picture.

        <p>The longitudinal evidence linking potentially modifiable risk factors to dementia generally fulfils causality criteria in observational data (strength, consistency, biological plausibility, temporality, dose-response, coherence, and quasi-experimental studies, for example, more education or using hearing aids). When measuring a risk nearer to the age of dementia onset, then it is more likely that prodromal change affects, or even causes it. Alternatively, a risk factor might act on preclinical pathology or even cause dementia near the time of exposure. Thus, excessive alcohol, and TBI are particularly important in young-onset dementia, although many early onset dementias relate to genetic risks. Risk factors might also matter more at a time of higher biological vulnerability, which the studies we have drawn on cannot establish. The length of exposure required for risk or protection effect, and their interrelationships as they change across life is unclear-it seems probable that longer or more intense exposure has stronger effects. Additionally, as our communality figures show, risk factors overlap. We cannot establish from these data if having multiple risk factors has an additive or synergistic effect. Association does not prove causation, however, as already noted, the reductions in prevalence and incidence in several HIC suggests that at least some of the risk factors estimated here do have a causal relationship with the clinical expression of dementia.The longitudinal evidence linking potentially modifiable risk factors to dementia generally fulfils causality criteria in observational data (strength, consistency, biological plausibility, temporality, dose-response, coherence, and quasi-experimental studies, for example, more education or using hearing aids).

        <p>We judge that sufficient new evidence supports adding three additional modifiable risk factors for dementia to our 2017 Commission model (excessive alcohol, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution). We have been able to add updated evidence on the nine risk factors implicated in the 2017 Commission (education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, inactivity, diabetes, and social contact). Reduction of these risk factors might be protective for people with or without a genetic risk, although study findings have not been entirely consistent. [175][176][177][178] As we noted in the 2017 Commission, others have previously calculated an estimate of the risk associated with APOε4 at 7% taking into account some other risk factors and this estimate highlights how relatively important potentially modifiable risk factors are in dementia. 2,179 For some risk factors, the pattern of risk and the individual's other health, both physical and mental, might be especially important. Currently, the evidence suggests a Mediterranean or Scandinavian diet might have value in preventing cognitive decline in people with intact cognition, particularly as one component of a healthy lifestyle, although how long the exposure has to be or during which ages is unclear. We do not recommend taking additional vitamins, oils, or mixed dietary supplements as a means of preventing dementia as extensive testing in trials has not led to signals of beneficial effects.We judge that sufficient new evidence supports adding three additional modifiable risk factors for dementia to our 2017 Commission model (excessive alcohol, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution).

        <p>Data from RCTs on interventions to prevent cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, or Alzheimer's disease are few. For some key life influences, only observational data, particularly related to natural experiments such as changing the statutory education age, are possible. These influences should be investigated systematically wherever possible. Others can theoretically be investigated but the long follow-up required for midlife risk and protective factors and non-random attrition in longer studies are challenging. Using intermediate endpoints, such as cognition, and dementia onset in research remains uncertain because no intermediate markers with such a close relationship to dementia outcomes exist that it would be possible to predict with certainty for any given individual, age, and sex. Overall, the evidence for treating hypertension is strongest and high blood pressure throughout midlife increases the risk of dementia even without stroke.Data from RCTs on interventions to prevent cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, or Alzheimer's disease are few.

        <p>Not all dementia will be preventable and we present the latest evidence on intervention and care for dementia. To date the emphasis has been on specific subtypes of dementia, most notably on Alzheimer's disease, which has been conceptualised over the years in a variety of changing diagnostic criteria-eg, DSM IV and DSM V. 180,181 Intense efforts have been put into biomarkers for early preclinical detection of the disease process before it becomes dementia. Biomarkers need to show reliability and validity, and for dementias they also need to be very closely and clearly related to clinical syndrome outcomes in the way that, for example, human papillomavirus is for cervical cancer, and hypertension has been for stroke.Not all dementia will be preventable and we present the latest evidence on intervention and care for dementia.

        <p>Markers of neurodegeneration linked to clinical dementia include brain volume loss-ie, hippocampal volume loss and entorhinal cortex and medial temporal cortical thinning-seen in structural imaging. The most studied molecular markers are in Alzheimer's disease and are amyloid and tau, which PET and CSF detect clinically. The prevalence of particular pathologies at different ages is important in interpretation of such studies. So, for example, population derived studies show increases in plaques in the population from less than 3% at age 50-59 years to around 40% at age 80-89 years. 182Markers of neurodegeneration linked to clinical dementia include brain volume loss-ie, hippocampal volume loss and entorhinal cortex and medial temporal cortical thinning-seen in structural imaging.

        <p>Similarly, an 8-year follow-up study of 599 volunteers (average age 70 years) in Australia found that cognitively normal PET amyloid-positive people had an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared with amyloid negative (17•7% vs 8•1%; OR 2•4, 95% CI 1•5-4•0). 184 Over 80% of the 266 people who were PET amyloid-positive did not go onto develop a cognitive impairment within 8 years, showing positive status does not predict impairment for most people in a timeframe that might be a useful prognostic window. Follow-up at 5 years of amyloid-positive participants with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment versus amyloid negative people found the same pattern of increased risk (2•6, 1•4-4•9). Risk also increases per 1 year of age (HR 1•05, 95% CI 0•55-2•0/year), and APOEε4 status (2•6, 1•4-5•0). 184 Most people who are amyloid positive with no other markers have not developed Alzheimer's disease dementia during their lifetime. A model of lifetime risks of people who are amyloid positive without any other biomarkers finds it to be 8•4% for a 90-year-old woman who is cognitively normal at baseline, 23•5% for a 75-year-old woman and 29•3% for a 65-year-old woman. 185 The 10-year risk is considerably less, so a 65-year-old woman with only amyloid biomarkers but who is cognitively normal and has no neurodegeneration has a 10-year Alzheimer's disease risk of 2•5% and a man 2•3%, but the risk is higher with accompanying neurodegeneration (table 2). 185 Overall, the knowledge of PET-measured amyloid and tau status and MRI-derived cortical thickness in a general population derived sample, only adds a small improvement, which might not be clinically important for predicting memory decline over a model with clinical and genetic variables. 186 Using amyloid PET in patients with cognitive impairment of uncertain causes, results in changes to the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 187 and sometimes to medication prescription. We do not know whether PET use improves patient care or decreases care costs.

        <p>To be useful in clinical practice biomarkers must be well understood in the populations to which they are going to be applied, including the effects of age and sex on results. There is now reasonable evidence that amyloid and tau measured by PET or in fluid indicate increased risk for development of cognitive impairment in older adults but at the individual level prognostication is not possible as most cognitively normal people with these markers do not develop dementia within a clinically relevant timeframe. Negative amyloid results can be useful for ruling out current Alzheimer's pathology in people with cognitive impairment when the cause is uncertain and show an individual is unlikely to develop Alzheimer's disease during the next few years. High neurofilament light concentrations indicate a neuro degenerative process but not its cause. The value of biomarkers, in terms of diagnostic value, has not been addressed in different representative populations and particularly not in those from LMIC. The potential advantages of blood biomarkers are their low cost and their wider acceptability and applicability in many settings. In many areas of medicine more reliable diagnostic tests have improved research, including epidemiological and public health research and trials, to help distinguish cause from symptom (tuberculosis from a fever) or assess risk factor and disease (hyper cholesterolaemia and ischaemic heart disease). Those biomarkers developed for the underlying biology of the dementia syndrome are subject to the same assessment of value.To be useful in clinical practice biomarkers must be well understood in the populations to which they are going to be applied, including the effects of age and sex on results.

        <p>Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and often clus tered in people with dementia. These symptoms might precede dementia and are associated with tau and amyloid neuropathology. 210 This suggests that underlying neurobiological mechanisms might underpin neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, other drivers relating to the personal history and the environment of the person with dementia are also likely to exist. Neurodegeneration could lead to increased vulnerability to stressors or triggers. Genetics, cognitive reserve, resilience, medical comorbidities, and environment including responses of carers might modify these relationships. Needs and responses will also be individual and relate to a person's own social, cultural, and historical context. First-line assessment and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms should focus on basic health: describe and diagnose symptoms; look for causes such as pain (using validated pain assessments might help), illness, discomfort, hunger, loneliness, boredom, lack of intimacy and worry that could cause the behaviours and alleviate these while considering risks of harm. 2 No new evidence of medication effectiveness for these symptoms exists; risperidone in low doses (0•5 mg daily) and some other antipsychotics are sometimes effective but often ineffective and have adverse effects. 2 Specific initiatives have led to a decrease in antipsychotic prescriptions for people with dementia, although often replaced with other psycho tropics (figure 8), such as benzodiazepines, antidepres sants, and mood stabilisers. 211 These psychotropics lack evidence of efficacy for neuropsychiatric symptoms but show clear evidence of possible harm; for example, trazodone and benzodiazepines increase fall-related injuries. 144 Major policy changes should be assessed carefully, within and across countries for unintended consequences (and perhaps unexpected benefits) and their costs.Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and often clus tered in people with dementia.

        <p>Evidence is slowly accumulating for the effectiveness, at least in the short term, of person-centred evidence-based psychosocial interventions.

The intervention consisted of psychosocial management of treatment and care, medi cation management and carer support, and education and discussion with a psychiatrist or neurologist. The intervention, compared with care as usual, was associated with better outcomes for neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] score -7•5, 95% CI -11•1 to -3•8), however this effect could be because of deterioration in care as usual (in the care as usual group NPI increased from 7•2 to 15•2; in the intervention group NPI increased from 7•6 to 8•2). This between-group reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms was greater than that expected, extrapolating from other study results, with antipsychotic medication.

        <p>Since the 2017 Commission two new systematic reviews of antidepressants to treat depression in dementia reported moderate quality evidence that antidepressant treatment for people with dementia does not lead to better control of symptomatology compared with placebo. 214,215 Agitation Agitation is distressing for people with dementia and those around them, and contributes substantially to the overall costs as the level of agitation increases. 216 The body of evidence on this key behaviour is growing, mostly focused on care-home settings. These findings are valuable as these populations are most affected; however, because many people with dementia reside at home a major gap in knowledge remains. Care home residents with agitation often find sitting still difficult and therefore might not be included in activities. 217,218 Two new cluster RCTs of professionals delivering multicomponent, interdisciplinary, interventions in care homes successfully reduced agitation. The WHELD study 219 included participants with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and provided person-centred care, aiming to improve communication with people with dementia. It implemented social, sensory experiences or other activities; educated about antipsychotic review; and addressed physical problems, finding lower Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) at 9 months (MD -4•3 points, 95% CI -7•3 to -1•2). 219 The TIME study 220 for people with moderate-to-high levels of agitation consisted of a manual-based comprehensive assessment of the resident and structured case conference for the staff and doctor, to create a tailored plan, and then implement it. This intervention led to reduced agitation at 8 weeks (NPI -1•1 points, 95% CI -0•1 to -2•1; CMAI -4•7 points, -0•6 to -8•8) and 12 weeks (NPI -1•6, -0•6 to -2•7; CMAI -5•9, -1•7 to -10•1). 220 These effect sizes are similar to those seen for medications, but without harmful side-effects. 2,221 A further RCT studied a six-session intervention with staff in groups, teaching staff to understand agitation as related to medical, psychological, or social unmet needs and to implement strategies to meet these needs, using the describe, investigate, create, and evaluate approach. 222 The intervention did not reduce agitation symptoms, although it was cost-effective, improving quality of life. 223 Overall, the current evidence for agitation in care homes favours multi-component interventions by clinical staff, including considering if drugs might harm, and not drug interventions.

        <p>Carer distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than the dementia symptoms was associated in one study with increased use and costs of health services, 232 high lighting the need for effectively identifying, educating, and supporting distressed carers. An RCT 233 reporting 6-year follow-up after the eight session STrAtegies for RelaTives intervention-manual-based coping intervention delivered by supervised psychology graduates-found continuing effectiveness for depressive symptoms in carers (adjusted MD -2•00; 95% CI -3•4 to -0•6) and risk of case-level depression, with patient-related cost being approximately 3 times lower than those who did not receive the intervention (median £5759 vs £16 964 in the final year; p=0•07). 233 Another US study 234 followed up 663 people, mean age 77 years, 55% women. Caregiver depression rather than symptoms of people with dementia predicted emergency department use for people with dementia, with a 73% (RR 1•73, 95% CI 1•3-2•3) increase. 234 Functioning A UK RCT of 14 sessions of cognitive rehabilitation focused on individual goal attainment with therapy delivered at home by an occupational therapist or nurse to 475 participants with mild-to-moderate dementia (MMSE ≥18 for inclusion; mean 24) and a family carer. 235 Individuals had two or three goals; the most common was engaging in activities (21% of goals). The intervention group reported increased goal attainment over 3 and 9 months compared with usual treatment (effect size 0•8, 95% CI 0•6-1•0 at both 3 and 9 months). 235 The treatment did not improve participants' quality of life, mood, selfefficacy, cognition, carer stress, or health status and was not cost-effective. A systematic review 236 of RCTs without meta-analysis for overall effect size, concluded that all interventions which had improved functioning in people living with dementia in the community have been individual rather than group interventions. These were: in-home physiotherapist delivered aerobic exercise (two studies, larger one positive, 140 people with Alzheimer's disease; smaller study negative, 30 people with Alzheimer's disease), individualised cogni tive rehabilitation (mild or moderate dementia; two studies; 257 cognitive reserve intervention groups and 255 controls), and in-home activities-focused occupa tional therapy (people with mild to moderate dementia, three studies, 201 intervention, 191 controls) reduced functional decline compared to controls but group-exercise and reminiscence therapies were ineffective. 236Carer distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than the dementia symptoms was associated in one study with increased use and costs of health services, 232 high lighting the need for effectively identifying, educating, and supporting distressed carers.

Caregiver depression rather than symptoms of people with dementia predicted emergency department use for people with dementia, with a 73% (RR 1•73, 95% CI 1•3-2•3) increase. 234 Functioning A UK RCT of 14 sessions of cognitive rehabilitation focused on individual goal attainment with therapy delivered at home by an occupational therapist or nurse to 475 participants with mild-to-moderate dementia (MMSE ≥18 for inclusion; mean 24) and a family carer. 235 Individuals had two or three goals; the most common was engaging in activities (21% of goals). The intervention group reported increased goal attainment over 3 and 9 months compared with usual treatment (effect size 0•8, 95% CI 0•6-1•0 at both 3 and 9 months). 235 The treatment did not improve participants' quality of life, mood, selfefficacy, cognition, carer stress, or health status and was not cost-effective. A systematic review 236 of RCTs without meta-analysis for overall effect size, concluded that all interventions which had improved functioning in people living with dementia in the community have been individual rather than group interventions. These were: in-home physiotherapist delivered aerobic exercise (two studies, larger one positive, 140 people with Alzheimer's disease; smaller study negative, 30 people with Alzheimer's disease), individualised cogni tive rehabilitation (mild or moderate dementia; two studies; 257 cognitive reserve intervention groups and 255 controls), and in-home activities-focused occupa tional therapy (people with mild to moderate dementia, three studies, 201 intervention, 191 controls) reduced functional decline compared to controls but group-exercise and reminiscence therapies were ineffective. 236</p>
        <p>Multimorbidity is a huge challenge in dementia, not only because people with dementia have increased rates of other illnesses, but also because they often find it parti cularly difficult to organise care. People with dementia might forget to tell their family or health professionals of symptoms, struggle to understand or follow agreed plans, and are more likely to forget to drink and eat, increasing falling and infection rates. 237 People with dementia consult primary care less often 238 and have fewer dental visits 239 than those without dementia and their family members, if involved, often feel they lack knowledge to assist. 240 Health-care professionals need education to be more comfortable, understanding, and positive in communicating with people with dementia. 241 Around 70-80% of people diagnosed with dementia in primary care have at least two other chronic illnesses. 242,243 People who are physically more frail are more likely to have dementia, but the relationship between pathology and symptoms in these people is comparatively weak suggesting that dementia might be from other causes. 22 Compared to the general older population, people with dementia have increased rates of cerebro vascular disease, 243-246 stroke, 247 Parkinson's disease, 243,245 dia betes, 245,247 skin ulcers, anxiety and depression, 243,245 pneu monia, incontinence, and electrolyte disturbance. 245 Multimorbidity in people with dementia is associated with faster functional decline 248 and worse quality of life for people with dementia and their family carers. 249Multimorbidity is a huge challenge in dementia, not only because people with dementia have increased rates of other illnesses, but also because they often find it parti cularly difficult to organise care.

        <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in patients with viral pneumonia in Hubei province, China. 250 Severity and mortality of the associated disease (COVID-19) worsen with increasing age 251 and with pre-existing illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes, 252 and thus many people with dementia are at particular risk. Death certificates from the UK indicate that dementia and Alzheimer's disease were the most common underlying conditions, specified in 11 950 deaths (25•6% of all deaths involving COVID-19) in March to May, 2020. 253 Many charities, practitioners, and academics supporting people with dementia have issued guidance based on current evidence and best practice, including advance consideration of whether people would wish to be hospitalised if they develop severe COVID-19. Concern has been expressed that the illness and consequent distancing might increase family carer stress, loneliness, neuropsychiatric symptoms and use of psychotropic medication, and lead to complications, including future dementia. Interventions delivered remo tely through technology have also been implemented in some places. [254][255][256][257] People with dementia might struggle to adhere to measures to reduce virus transmission, as they might not understand or remember about required changes to behaviour, such as physical distancing and hygiene, leading to increased risk to themselves and their carers. 258 They might additionally be vulnerable if they depend on others for daily activities or personal care, as this necessitates close personal contact.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in patients with viral pneumonia in Hubei province, China. 250 Severity and mortality of the associated disease (COVID-19) worsen with increasing age 251 and with pre-existing illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes, 252 and thus many people with dementia are at particular risk.

        <p>This situation is particularly concerning in those care homes, where many residents have dementia and where many COVID-19 deaths have occurred in many countries [259][260][261] with reports of more than half of residents being admitted to hospital. In US nursing homes, among 10 576 people with confirmed COVID-19, residents living with dementia made up 52% of COVID-19 cases; yet, accounted for 72% of all deaths (an increased risk of 1•7). 262 The number of people living together in care homes means that the infection of an individual, either staff or resident, could endanger more people than in traditional or family households. Although evidence exists that if staff are sufficiently and rigorously protected they are unlikely to develop COVID-19, many staff have become unwell and some have died. 263,264 Illness means that there are fewer people to care for residents at a time when they need particularly high levels of care. This situation is par ticularly relevant in the care of residents with dementia, if they are expected to remain in their own rooms, rather than eating and participating in activities with others. Staff or residents might also be moved between care homes and increase risk in other homes. 261 Restrictions on visitors to private homes, care homes, and hospitals might cause greater distress for people with dementia and they might not understand why people are wearing masks, recognise who is behind it, or understand speech when lips are covered. Lack of restrictions means that the visitors might also be at elevated risk. 261 The impacts of COVID-19 on people with dementia might be particularly severe in LMICs, due to smaller health budgets for testing and protective equipment, capacity of health-care systems, quality of care home provision and patterns of workforce mobility. 264 Thus, people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age, multimorbidity, and difficulties in maintaining physical distancing. [250][251][252] We recommend rigorous public health measures of protective equipment and hygiene, including not moving staff or residents between care homes or admitting new residents when their COVID-19 status is unknown, should mitigate impacts on people with dementia. It is also imperative that there is frequent and regular testing of staff in care homes for infection, ensuring staff have sick pay so that they do not come in when symptomatic and interim care is being set up for people discharged from hospital so that only those who are COVID-19 free come to live in care homes. Resident testing should encompass asymptomatic as well as symptomatic people, when there is exposure within the home to COVID-19. In the future, many homes might be able to start to provide oxygen therapy so that those who do not want to be admitted to hospital are still able to access oxygen therapy. In addition, it is also important to reduce isolation by providing the necessary equipment and a brief training to relatives on how to protect themselves and others from COVID-19; so that they can visit their relatives with dementia in nursing homes safely when it is allowed.

        <p>Hospitalisation in people with dementia is associated with adverse, unintended consequences, including distress, func tional and cognitive decline, and high economic costs. [265][266][267] People with dementia have 1•4 to 4 times more hospital admissions than others with similar illnesses. 266,[268][269][270] A systematic review and meta-analysis including 34 studies of 277 432 people with dementia found that in the six studies which compared the two groups, people with dementia had increased hospital admissions compared with those without dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and physical comorbidity (RR 1•4, 95% CI 1•2-1•7; figure 9). 271 Hospitalisation rates in people with dementia ranged from 0•37 to 1•26 per person-year in high-quality studies. Admissions are often for conditions that might be manageable in the community (potentially preventable hospitalisations). 268 People with dementia experience longer and more frequent admissions and readmissions; health-care expenditure for people with moderate-severe dementia is around double that of people without dementia. 269,272,273 Early detection and management of physical ill-health in people with dementia, particularly of pain, falls, diabetes, incontinence, and sensory impair ment, is important. 199,274,275 However, no intervention has successfully reduced number of hos pital admissions of community-dwelling people with demen tia, 276 although education, exercise, rehabilitation, and telemedicine have reduced admissions for older people without dementia. 277 High-quality care for people with dementia takes longer than caring for others with the same condition. 278 Recognition of dementia in hospital inpatients is necessary for optimum care, 279 but dementia is often undetected or unrecorded. 280 In the UK however, detection rates have increased over the past 10 years. 281Hospitalisation in people with dementia is associated with adverse, unintended consequences, including distress, func tional and cognitive decline, and high economic costs.

        <p>Dementia and delirium frequently occur together. In one hospital inpatients' survey nearly 35% of those older than 80 years experienced delirium; those with prior cognitive impairment had 15 times the risk of devel oping delirium than those without (OR 15•3, 95% CI 5•2-45•4). 282 People with delirium without known dementia are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia in the future than others, either because of pre-existing undiagnosed dementia or cognitive impairment, present in 20•7% (95% CI 11•9-29•5) and 37•8% (27•3-88•3) respectively of one cohort, or because delirium has neurotoxic effects and so precipitates dementia. 283 People with similar people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease had mixed causes of dementia. 299 Although Alzheimer's disease neuropathology was the commonest cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease changes rarely occurred on their own, so only 9% of people with dementia had pure Alzheimer's disease pathology. 300 People who have Alzheimer's disease patho logy without developing dementia tend to have fewer age-related health deficits than those who develop it with even low concentrations of plaques and tangles. 301 A moderation analysis showed that the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and dementia status differed according to level of frailty (adjusted for age, sex, and education) with increasing frailty weakening the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and dementia (figure 10). 22 As with delirium, some of this additional health risk might be modifiable. This approach suggests a new type of therapy focus on specific agerelated processes that underpin many diseases of late life might reduce the incidence or severity of dementia.Dementia and delirium frequently occur together.

        <p>The numbers of people dying with dementia are increasing but the evidence for the best end-of-life care is scarce. Trends in age-standardised death rates (3•6%) for dementia increased slightly between 1990-2016, with pronounced increases in the USA and Japan and decreases in western Europe and central Latin America. 4 Dementia is more readily being included on death certificates, which accounts for some of the rise. The increase might be related to dementia manifesting at later ages, with higher physical frailty 22 leading to a faster decline. Most people with dementia might die while still in the mild-to-moderate stages whereas only about a quarter of those dying with dementia have severe dementia. 302,303 The trajectory of dementia is often unpredictable 304 and palliative care initiation should reflect need not prognosis. neuropatho logy show faster cognitive decline if they develop delirium than if they do not. 284 Additionally, older people without dementia declined cognitively more than twice as fast after an emergency hospital admission for any cause, compared with those not admitted, suggesting any severe illness is associated with cognitive decline. 285 Risk factors for delirium in dementia include sensory impairment, pain, poly pharmacy, dehydration, intercurrent illnesses, such as urinary tract infections or faecal impaction, and an unfamiliar or changing environment. 286 Delirium in older people should prompt consideration of underlying dementia.The numbers of people dying with dementia are increasing but the evidence for the best end-of-life care is scarce.

        <p>Most research on delirium prevention has been in people without dementia. It suggests targeting hydration, stopping medication predisposing to delirium, monitoring the depth of anaesthesia, and sleep promotion.

This multidisciplinary treatment consists of daily visits, orientation, therapeutic activities, sleep enhancement, early mobilisation, vision and hearing adaptation, fluid repletion, infection prevention and management of constipation, pain, and hypoxia, and feeding assistance. 290 A network meta-analysis of drugs for prevention and treatment of delirium did not include studies of people with dementia, thus we cannot use this to recommend drugs for people with dementia and delirium as this research might be inapplicable to them. 291 Little high-quality research exists on managing delirium in dementia. One RCT compared care at a specialist medical and mental health unit to usual care for 600 confused people older than 65 years, acutely admitted to hospital and found no difference in the primary outcome of days spent at home or in hos pital, but increased family satisfaction. 292 A further RCT of cognitively stimulating activities for people with delirium in dementia did not improve the delirium. 293 No definitive evidence that any medication improves delirium in people with dementia exists: cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and sedating benzodiazepines are ineffective and antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are associated with mortality and morbidity. 265,288,[294][295][296][297] Given the risk of dementia in people who develop delirium, its prevention, and possibly advances in its management, might offer a means for dementia prevention. 298Most research on delirium prevention has been in people without dementia.

        <p>The fastest growing demographic group in most advanced countries are people aged 90 years and older. One well characterised post-mortem cohort of the oldest old (n=1079; mean age 90 years) dying with dementia, found that neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease account for about half of the cognitive decline seen as Decision making about end of life is complex and simple rules of thumb, co-designed with staff and carers, provided clarity in some small studies. 304 One RCT testing decision-aids about families' and doctors' goals of care for people with advanced dementia led to increased palliative care content in care plans. 305,306 In a 9-month UK prospective study, 85 care home residents with advanced dementia from 14 homes were likely to be living with distressing symptoms, specifically agitation (54%) or pain (61% on movement). 304 Capacity to make abstract decisions, including about the future, might be lost early in dementia. 307 Therefore, advance care planning, designed to empower people with dementia and improve quality of dying, might theoretically be something everyone should do before developing dementia. 308 However, people might not be able to predict their future wishes. This might explain why family carer proxies show only low-to-moderate agreement with stated end-of-life treatment preferences of people with dementia. 309 Advance care planning might, however, reduce carers' uncertainty in decision making and improve perceptions of quality of care. 310 Partners of people dying with dementia experience poorer mental health than those facing bereavement from other causes 311 possibly because of long and difficult caring responsibilities. This might be ameliorated through sensitive and timely information, particularly regarding the progression of dementia, 312 individually or through family and staff case-conferencing. 313,314The fastest growing demographic group in most advanced countries are people aged 90 years and older.
