        <p>Systemic scleroderma (SSc) is one of the most complex systemic autoimmune diseases. It targets the vasculature, connective tissue-producing cells (namely fibroblasts/myofibroblasts), and components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Clinical and pathologic manifestations of SSc are the result of: (1) innate/adaptive immune system abnormalities leading to production of autoantibodies and cell-mediated autoimmunity, (2) microvascular endothelial cell/small vessel fibroproliferative vasculopathy, and (3) fibroblast dysfunction generating excessive accumulation of collagen and other matrix components in skin and internal organs. All three of these processes interact and affect each other. The disease is heterogeneous in its clinical presentation that likely reflects different genetic or triggering factor (i.e., infection or environmental toxin) influences on the immune system, vasculature, and connective tissue cells. The roles played by other ubiquitous molecular entities (such as lysophospholipids, endocannabinoids, and their diverse receptors and vitamin D) in influencing the immune system, vasculature, and connective tissue cells are just beginning to be realized and studied and may provide insights into new therapeutic approaches to treat SSc.Systemic scleroderma (SSc) is one of the most complex systemic autoimmune diseases.

        <p>introduction Systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) is a complex connective tissue disease of unknown etiology with multiorgan involvement and heterogeneous clinical manifestations. The clinical and pathologic manifestations of the disease are the result of three distinct processes: (1) innate and adaptive immune system abnormalities leading to production of autoantibodies and cell-mediated autoimmunity, (2) microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) and fibroproliferative vasculopathy of small vessels, and (3) fibroblast dysfunction leading to excessive collagen (CI) and other matrix components accumulation in skin, blood vessels, and internal organs (1,2).introduction Systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) is a complex connective tissue disease of unknown etiology with multiorgan involvement and heterogeneous clinical manifestations.

        <p>The incidence of SSc is about 20 cases per million populations per year and the prevalence is more than 250 patients per million populations in USA (3). Major organ involvement leads to decreased survival in SSc. Pulmonary fibrosis [interstitial lung disease (ILD)] and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) cause more than half of all SSc-related deaths (3). However, patients with SSc live longer and cardiac deaths are increasing.The incidence of SSc is about 20 cases per million populations per year and the prevalence is more than 250 patients per million populations in USA (3).

        <p>Disease manifestations vary from limited skin involvement with minimal systemic involvement [limited cutaneous (lc) SSc] to widespread skin involvement accompanied by internal organ involvement [diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc]. These two forms differ mainly in regards to extent of skin involvement, autoantibody association, and the pattern of organ involvement (Table 1) (5). Given the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and signs, American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR recently developed new classification criteria (6). The new classification criteria would improve sensitivity, which would lead to earlier diagnosis, and it also incorporates the autoantibodies that are commonly used for diagnostic purposes.Disease manifestations vary from limited skin involvement with minimal systemic involvement [limited cutaneous (lc) SSc] to widespread skin involvement accompanied by internal organ involvement [diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc].

        <p>No animal model develops SSc that faithfully replicates human SSc, and this has impeded our understanding of the disease. There are many unresolved questions related to the etiopathogenesis of SSc. For example, it is unclear whether the innate/adaptive immune system abnormalities, vasculopathy, and fibroblast dysfunctions are separate, unrelated processes or are mechanistically linked, which of the three processes is of utmost importance and how interaction among the three processes leads to the development of the disease. These three processes will be discussed.No animal model develops SSc that faithfully replicates human SSc, and this has impeded our understanding of the disease.

        <p>We first review evidence for genetic abnormalities in SSc since they can influence responses of the innate and adaptive immune systems, vascular function, connective tissue metabolism, and fibroblast function. Since the innate and adaptive immune systems are the first to respond to environmental triggers, be they infections or toxins in nature, and through generations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that can affect function of vascular and connective tissue cells, we discuss them next. The vascular abnormalities and fibrosis in SSc are then discussed. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) (which influences functions of the immune system, vasculature, and fibroblasts) may be dysregulated in SSc as suggested by recent studies of SSc dermal fibroblasts. We have included a discussion of this important system with special emphasis on potential ECS targets that might offer new therapeutic approaches for management of SSc. Lysophospholipids [lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)] and their different receptors (which regulate immunity, vascular physiology, and fibrosis) are dysregulated in SSc and likely contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Vitamin D (VitD) status also impacts function of most cell types and likely influences pathogenesis andWe first review evidence for genetic abnormalities in SSc since they can influence responses of the innate and adaptive immune systems, vascular function, connective tissue metabolism, and fibroblast function.

        <p>Genetic influences have long been suspected to impact SSc. In families with a history of SSc, the incidence of disease can range from 1.5 to 1.7% (11). Having a family history of SSc increases the risk of developing disease 15-19-fold in siblings and 13-15-fold in first-degree relatives (11)(12)(13). Over the last decade, candidate gene study (CGS) approach and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic associations that confer susceptibility to SSc. CGS and GWAS have allowed for the identification of genetic variations [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] that are likely to be involved with the pathogenesis of scleroderma. CGS analyses SNPs to determine if the gene has association with a disease or a disease trait. The SNPs being studied have been selected based on their known association with other autoimmune diseases or on their possible functional relevance in the disease pathogenesis. GWAS arrays on the other hand, use tagSNPs to scan the entire genome to identify millions of SNPs. It takes into consideration the haplotype structure of the population being studied. Unlike CGS, GWAS identifies SNPs in a non-hypotheses-driven manner and allows for the identification of newly identifiable genes that were not previously identified in the disease. As regards to SSc, GWAS has confirmed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II region as being most significant in this disease. Both CGS and GWAS have identified multiple genes that have been found to have firm associations in the pathogenesis of SSc. Performing a GWAS can be very costly. Recently, the immunochip consortium was developed and implemented the immunochip analysis assay. The immunochip array provides high-density mapping of autoimmune diseases-associated loci using a custom SNP genotyping array (14). It was designed to increase efficiency of mapping autoimmunity risk loci and to reduce the cost of mapping (15). The immunochip uses variants from across 186 known autoimmunity risk loci and places them on an Illumina Infinium array platform. The platform contains 196,524 different variants of autoimmunity risk loci that may have functional significant effects in diseases like SSc. It also identifies variants with lower penetrance using a cost efficient strategy (14). Many of these genes have been Pathogenesis of SSc Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org firmly established in the pathogenesis of SSc.

        <p>The HLA-1 complexes HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G and HLA class-II complexes HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR have all been identified in SSc susceptibility (11,17,108,109) (Table 2). HLA class-II is the most significant region associated with SSc (14). HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-DRB1*11, HLA-A*30, and HLA-A*32 have SSc susceptibility, while HLA-DRB1*07, HLA-B*57, and HLA-Cw*14 are protective against SSc (17). HLA alleles DRB1*0802 and DQA1*0501 are associated with increased mortality (110). Clinical features of disease, disease phenotype, and SSc-specific autoantibodies have been distinguished based on HLA subtypes (Table 1). In a GWAS study that included 5471 SSc patients of European ancestry, HLA-DQB1 locus was associated with anticentromere antibodies (ACA), HLA-DPA1/B1 loci with anti-DNA topoisomerase I antibody (ATA), and neurogenic locus notch homolog 4 (NOTCH4) with ACA and ATA (24). In another study that included SSc patients of African American (AA) and Hispanic descent, DRB1*1104, DQA1*0501, DQB1*0301, and DQB1 had strong positive association in SSc patients of Hispanic and of European ancestry (24,31). DRB1*0404, DRB1*11, and DQB1*03 alleles are associated with anti-U3 ribonucleoprotein (ARA) in this subpopulation (24). In this same subpopulation, DRB1*0701, DQA1*0201, DQB1*0202, and DRB1*1501 had a negative or protective association against SSc (27). These studies have also identified DRB1*11 with association (29). In a study in French SSc patients with European ancestry, both FLEDR and, to a lesser degree, TRAELDT were associated with dcSSc (29). Addition of a tyrosine at position 30 strengthened the TRAELDT association with dcSSc (29). Further analysis showed that the FLEDR motif had the highest association with SSc patients who were ATA positive, while TRAELDT had lesser association in this subset (29). The TRAELDT association with ATA positivity and dcSSc were not dependent entirely on FLEDR (29). The authors concluded that double dose of the shared epitope, as well as compound heterozygosity, may confer a higher risk for development of SSc.The HLA-1 complexes HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G and HLA class-II complexes HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR have all been identified in SSc susceptibility (11,17,108,109) (Table 2).

        <p>Multiple studies including GWAS, meta-analysis, and recently immunochip array analysis have repeatedly shown that modifications in CD247, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 4 (STAT4) genes are associated with SSc susceptibility (Table 3). Many autoimmune disorders share a common genetic background. Both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and SSc share many clinical features and genetic components. Disease sample size and lack of statistical power limits the ability to determine which genes may contribute to autoimmunity. Combined analysis of different autoimmune diseases increase sample size and allows for statistical power to identify genetic variants that effect disease. Using a GWAS pan-meta-analysis approach allows for the detection of new genetic susceptibility loci, as determined by Martin et al. (47). In the Martin et al. study, GWAS pan-meta-analysis approach for SSc and SLE identified and validated three new susceptibility genes for SSc [KIAA0319L, paraxylene-orthoxylene domain containing serine/ threonine kinase (PXK), and JAZF1] (47). Genes related to cellular response to IFNγ and the nervous system was overrepresented in both SLE and SSc. In SSc, genes related to cell signaling, migration, and adhesion were over-represented (47).

        <p>A member of the human DNase 1 family, deoxyribonuclease 1-like 3 (DNASE1L3) is secreted by macrophages and is found in the liver and spleen (14). During apoptosis, DNASE1L3 has a role in the fragmentation of DNA. It also generates double-strand breaks in immunoglobulin-encoding genes. In regards to autoimmune susceptibility, DNASE1L3 is found to be associated with susceptibility to SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using the immunochip array, DNASE1L3 SNP rs35677470 was identified as a risk for SSc and ACA positivity. These authors identified a substitution in amino acid Arg to Cys at position 206 on exon 8 of DNASE1L3 protein resulted in the loss of a hydrogen bond. The amino acid substitution in this position may cause the protein to become inactive suggesting a potential role for SNP rs35677470 in autoimmunity due to defective apoptotic DNA breakdown (14).A member of the human DNase 1 family, deoxyribonuclease 1-like 3 (DNASE1L3) is secreted by macrophages and is found in the liver and spleen (14).

        <p>Multiple studies using GWAS, meta-analysis, and immunochip analysis assays have confirmed the involvement of IFN in SSc susceptibility. The identification of multiple variants in IFN genes in association with SSc, SSc lung disease, and SSc mortality highlights the significance of the IFN pathway in the development and progression of SSc. IFN modulate differentiation, survival, proliferation, and cytokine production by T and B cells and dendritic cells. IFN stimulate the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, and 9. IFN genes were overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with SSc and SLE. Higher IFN scores correlated with ATA, anti-U1RNP, lymphopenia, and IFNα/IFNβ receptor 2 (IFNAR2) missense mutation rs7279064 GG or GT (114). Other variants in the IFN pathway have also been well established in SSc. Polymorphisms in IRF5, IRF7, and IRF8 have been identified. IRF5 mediates IFN activity and is an important inflammatory signaling pathway. Polymorphisms in IRF5 are associated with SLE, RA, ulcerative colitis, and others. Regulation in immune reaction to infections by IRF5 is activated by TLRs 7 and 9. In SLE, IRF5-transportin-3 gene (TPO) rs4728142 correlates with IRF5 expression leading to increased binding of zinc-finger BD 3 (ZBTB3) affecting both RNA transcription and DNA binding (115). In SSc, IRF5 rs200460 is associated with dcSSc, lcSSc, ATA, and ACA. The strongest association is with ATA and ILD (38). It is linked to overall mortality independent of disease type or serology (39). A Han Chinese cohort of 424 SSc patients identified rs2004640*TT genotype as being significant in this population. This variant is associated with pulmonary fibrosis and ATA positivity (40). IRF5 rs4728142 is predictive of longer survival and milder pulmonary fibrosis. The association is independent of age of disease onset, autoantibody profile, or disease type (41). IRF7: Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activates type IFN genes in response to DNA/RNA immune complexes and viral infections. IRF7 associates with susceptibility to SLE. Multiple variants in the IRF7 genes confer susceptibility to SSc. IRF7 rs1131665 is associated with SSc-associated ACA positivity. The variants identified were replicated in a Spanish cohort (87).

        <p>Attention has focused on the possible contribution of the immune system to pathogenetic processes in PAH, especially innate immunity and IFNs (116,117). Type I IFNs are implicated by the association of use of IFNα in the treatment of hepatitis and of IFNβ in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with development of PAH (118,119). Diseases in which there is an "IFN signature" (such as SLE, SSc, and infection with HIV) are associated with development of PAH (120)(121)(122)(123)(124). Furthermore, IFNα and IFNγ added to cultures of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) primed with TNFα or to cultures of human lung MVEC or human lung fibroblasts, cause release of the potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1, and of IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (117). In a series of 128 SSc patients with PAH and 35 patients with no PAH, the SSc patients with PAH had higher levels of IP-10 and ET-1 in their sera compared to SSc patients without PAH or compared to healthy controls. More SSc patients with PAH had detectable levels of IFNα and IFNγ in their sera than SSc patients without PAH (117). In this series of SSc patients, levels of TNFα, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-8 were significantly higher in sera in SSc patients with PAH when compared to SSc patients without PAH (117). Additional studies of this patient group revealed that serum levels of IP-10 in the SSc-PAH patients correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance, and levels of brain natriuretic peptide in serum, and serum IP-10 levels in the SSc-PAH patients inversely correlated with cardiac index and 6-min walks test (117). Sections of lung from patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) or with SSc-PAH expressed higher levels of type I interferon receptor 1 (IFNR1) in endothelium, smooth muscle layer, vascular interstitium, and in intravascular inflammatory cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting (117). While the above studies strongly implicated type I IFN as playing a pathogenic role in SSc-PAH and IPAH, further evidence was substantiated in the type I interferon α receptor 1 knockout mouse which was found to be resistant to experimental hypoxic PAH induction. These mice did not have elevated serum levels of ET-1 when compared to wild-type (WT) control mice (117). Analysis of PBMC from patients with SSc revealed CD169/ sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) and other IFN-regulated genes were overexpressed in patients with dcSSc, whereas patients with lcSSc with PAH overexpressed IL-13RA1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), C-C chemokine receptor type 1 protein or gene (CCR1), JAK2, and melanocortin receptor 1 (MCR1) (123,125,126). IL-13 was also elevated to higher levels in sera of patients with lcSSc with PAH, and MCR1 was induced on CD14 + monocytes suggesting monocytes are activated in lcSSc patients with PAH of an alternative (i.e., IL-4/IL-13) rather than classical [i.e., IFNγ/ lipopolysaccharides (LPS)] pathway (123).

        <p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 4 is critical for T-cell signaling and differentiation (132)(133)(134). STAT4 is involved in effecting a Th1 cytokine response by transmitting signals from IL-2, IL-12, and IL-23 receptors and in signaling after type 1-IFN engages its receptor (135,136). The role of STAT4 in fibrosis was assessed in scleroderma mouse models. To assess the contribution of STAT4 to bleomycin (BLM)-induced skin fibrosis and fibrosis of skin in (tight skin) Tsk-1/+ mice, BLM was injected for 3 weeks into STAT4 -/-and STAT4 +/+ mice. STAT4 -/-mice were crossed with Tsk-1/+ mice, and skin fibrosis was assessed (137). The deletion of STAT4 significantly reduced skin fibrosis in the BLM model but not in the Tsk-1/+ model (137). In the BLM model, it was noted that there were decreased numbers of inflammatory cells including T cells and proliferating T cells and decreased quantity of IL-6, IL-2, TNFα, and IFNγ in lesional skin of STAT4 -/-vs. STAT4 +/+ mice (137). Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 4 is considered an autoimmunity loci since its association has been firmly confirmed in SLE, RA, primary biliary cirrhosis, and SSc (48). SNP rs7574865 is associated susceptibility to lcSSc and ACA positivity (50,51). SNP rs7574865 and rs10168266 were associated with dcSSc, ATA positivity, and pulmonary fibrosis in a Chinese cohort (52). Variant rs7574865*T allele has an additive effect with IRF5 rs2004640 seen in fibrosing alveolitis (38). Gene-gene interactions between STAT4 and polymorphism in the transcription factor T-bet show increased susceptibility to SSc. Transcription factor T-bet [(T-box expressed in T cells) (TBX21)] is an important transcriptional activator of Th1 differentiation effecting Th1/Th2 balance. Polymorphisms in TBX21 have associations with RA, asthma, and type 1 DM. TT genotype of TBX21 variant rs11650354 confers susceptibility to SSc in a recessive manner while STAT4 variant rs11889341 A allele is associated with an increased risk of SSc in a dominant pattern. STAT4 genotype increased the SSc risk in the presence of TBX21 CC genotype (53). Plasma levels of circulating IL-6 and TNF were increased in SSc patients who carry the TBX21 CC genotype where as those who carry the TT genotype show increased circulating IL-2 and IL-5 suggesting that patients who carry the CC genotype have a prominent proinflammatory cytokine profile (53). Gene expression profile from whole blood RNA of SSc patients suggest a role for type 1-IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CC genotype and of the T-cell pathway in the TT group (53).Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 4 is critical for T-cell signaling and differentiation (132)(133)(134).

        <p>Various triggers induce synthesis of ET-1 including TGF-β and other growth factors, cold exposure, low shear stress, hypoxia, and angiotensin II (140); but its synthesis is reduced by nitric oxide (NO), natriuretic peptides, increased blood flow, and prostacyclin (141). ET-1 is also degraded by MMP-1, which is reduced in SSc (140). Two types of receptors for ET-1 (ETα and ETβ) are variably expressed on endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, adventitial fibroblasts, tissue fibroblasts, neutrophils, mast cells; and monocytes and ET receptor engagement on these cells triggers a variety of pro-inflammatory or fibrotic response, including vasoconstriction of vasculature (140). ET-1 increases surface expression of ICAM-1 on fibroblasts, stimulates CI synthesis, promotes formation of myofibroblasts, and facilitates binding of T cells to fibroblasts (140,142). ET-1 acts as a downstream mediator of TGF-β, and its induction by TGF-β in fibroblasts is via small mother against decapentaplegic (Smad)-independent signaling that involves c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5 pathways (143). Polymorphisms of ET-1 receptors are associated with SSc. For example, there is an association of EDNRB polymorphisms and dcSSc and EDNR-A polymorphism with anti-RNA polymerase autoantibodies in SSc (140). Polymorphisms were also described in the promoter of the NOS2 gene that confers susceptibility to PAH in SSc (144).

        <p>MicroRNAs are translational regulators of gene expression and also destabilize messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of target genes (146). MiRNAs are tissue-and cell type-specific short, single-stranded non-coding RNAs that function to modulate gene expression (Table 4). MiRNA bind to the 3ʹ untranslated region of mRNA of the target gene and mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Once bound, they either cause translational repression of the target gene or induce the degradation of the gene (147)(148)(149). In SSc, several miRNAs are associated with TGF-β and CI expression. In comparison to normal skin tissue, Zhu et al. (93,147) found that skin from patients with lc and dc SSc expressed miR-21, miR-31, miR-146, miR-503, miR-145, and miR-29b. In these patients, miR-21 was increased in both tissue and fibroblasts whereas miR-145 and -29b were decreased. These miRNAs targeted the TGF-β pathway -including Smad7, Smad3, and COL1A1. TGF-β stimulation resulted in increased miR-21 expression and decreased expression of Smad7, while the upregulation of miR-145 was associated with a downregulation of Smad3 message. These same authors found that overexpressing miR-21 in fibroblasts decreased Smad7 but knocking down the expression of miR-21 increased Smad7 expression (93). miR-21 was also found to have increased expression in BLM-induced skin fibrosis. Reporter gene assay analyses revealed that the target gene for miR-21 is Smad7, while the target gene for miR-145 is Smad3 (93,94). Ninety-five miRNAs were analyzed in the sera of SSc patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that miR-30b was significantly downregulated in SSc patients and the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) inversely correlated with the level of miR-30b (95). Downregulation was also seen in the skin of scleroderma patients and BLM-treated sclerotic skin (95). Transfection studies Pathogenesis of SSc Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org showed that miR-30b affects platelet-derived growth factor/ receptor (PDGFR)-β expression by suppressing this receptor (95). In their evaluation of 15 SSc patients and 15 normal subjects, Koba et al. (150) found that miR-206 and miR-21 were useful in distinguishing patients with SSc from normal subjects (150).MicroRNAs are translational regulators of gene expression and also destabilize messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of target genes (146). MiRNAs are tissue-and cell type-specific short, single-stranded non-coding RNAs that function to modulate gene expression (Table 4). MiRNA bind to the 3ʹ untranslated region of mRNA of the target gene and mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Once bound, they either cause translational repression of the target gene or induce the degradation of the gene (147)(148)(149). In SSc, several miRNAs are associated with TGF-β and CI expression. In comparison to normal skin tissue, Zhu et al. (93,147) found that skin from patients with lc and dc SSc expressed miR-21, miR-31, miR-146, miR-503, miR-145, and miR-29b.

        <p>The expression of miR-196a was investigated in SSc both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo miR-196a was detected in the serum of SSc patients. Patients who had measurable lower levels of miR-196a had dcSSc compared to lcSSc. Lower levels of miR-196a was also associated with higher prevalence of pitting digital scars and more fibrotic skin as measured by MRSS (99). In vitro, the expression of miR-196a was normalized by TGF-β small interfering RNA (siRNA) in SSc fibroblasts, and the addition of miR-196a inhibitor to these fibroblasts resulted in the downregulation of CI. When the inhibitor was added to normal fibroblasts, there was an overexpression of CI (99). These results suggest that miR-196a may regulate CI expression.The expression of miR-196a was investigated in SSc both in vitro and in vivo.

        <p>Micro-RNA-29 (miR-29) is a TGF-β associated miRNA and is linked to fibrosis likely by interaction with several extracellular genes including ELN, FBN1, COL1A, COL1A2, and COL3A1 (151,152). TGF-β/Smad3 signaling appears to negatively regulate miR-29 (153). Support for this relationship was the finding that in BLM pulmonary fibrosis mouse model, Smad3 was upregulated while miR-29 was downregulated in contrast to results with Smad3 -/-mice, which were protected from BLN pulmonary fibrosis and miR-29 was upregulated (153). In addition, therapeutic delivery of miR-29 to mice using Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated gene transfer protected mice from developing BLM-induced lung fibrosis (153). MiR-29a has the ability to bind to the 3ʹUTR of COL1A1 and COL1A2 (96,154). Maurer et al. (97) found that miR-29a was strongly downregulated in SSc fibroblasts and skin sections when compared to healthy controls (97). SSc fibroblasts, in which miR-29 was overexpressed, exhibited decreased expression and protein levels of CI and CIII, while knockdown of miR-29 in normal fibroblasts increased CI production. Levels of miR-29 were reduced in normal fibroblasts when these fibroblasts were cultured with TGF-β, PDGF-β, or IL-4 (97). These studies confirm that miR-29a directly regulates CI. Serum levels of miR-29a were investigated to determine its potential role as a biomarker in SSc. In 61 patients with SSc, approximately 40% of which had dcSSc, miR-29a was found to be upregulated and not downregulated as expected in the serum of these patients. Patients with scleroderma spectrum disorder (SSD) are those who did not fulfill the ACR diagnosis criteria for SSc but who may develop scleroderma in the future. In these patients, miR-29a was downregulated compared to healthy controls, dcSSc, and lcSSc patients (96).

        <p>MiR-129-5p is a regulator of COL1A1 (154) and is downregulated in SSc (105). Nakashima et al. (105) found that, in their 20 patients with SSc, IL-17A expression was increased in the involved skin and sera, but IL-17R type A was decreased in SSc fibroblasts when compared to normal (105). IL-17A reduced protein expression of type I CI α1 chain [α1(I)] and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). IL-17A also induced the expression of miR-129-5p (105). In the presence of IL-17A, miR-129-5p is increased with α1(I) and CTGF. The authors suggest that since SSc fibroblasts have intrinsic activation of TGF-β, TGF-β suppresses IL-17A, in addition to miR-129-5p with resultant CI accumulation (105). MicroRNA-29a and miRNA-196a are low in SSc fibroblasts and can suppress CI gene expression, suggesting the low-level expression of the miRNAs permit CI to be upregulated by TGF-β and other mediators in SSc fibrogenesis (97,99). Levels of other miRNAs have been found to differ in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls as follows: serum miR-142-3p was higher in SSc patients than healthy controls (106); levels of miR-21 were increased, whereas levels of miR-145 and miR-29b were decreased in SSc lesional fibroblasts (94); miR-92a is more elevated in sera and SSc lesional fibroblasts than in normal healthy controls and may downregulate MMP-1 (107); and levels of miRNA-7 were found to be reduced in sera and lesional fibroblasts from patients with localized scleroderma and may regulate CI expression (102). MiR-150 regulates β3 integrin expression and was found to be downregulated in lesional SSc dermal fibroblasts compared to healthy donor fibroblasts (101); miR let-7a was found to be decreased in sera and lesional fibroblasts from patients with SSc or localized scleroderma (104); and miR-21 was found to be upregulated in SSc lesional dermal fibroblasts (93).MiR-129-5p is a regulator of COL1A1 (154) and is downregulated in SSc (105).

        <p>Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) were both found to be decreased in SSc dermal fibroblasts (103,104). In SSc dermal fibroblasts, DDR2 mRNA and protein levels were suppressed, but the knockdown of TGF-β in these fibroblasts resulted in increased expression of DDR2 (104). In normal fibroblasts, DDR2 knockdown increased miR-196a expression with resultant decrease in CI. This was not seen when DDR2 was knocked-down in SSc fibroblasts (104). In SSc, fibroblasts, knocking down DDR2 did not affect TGF-β signaling or miR-196a expression, suggesting that intrinsic expression of TGF-β causes the downregulation of DDR2 in SSc fibroblasts (104).Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) were both found to be decreased in SSc dermal fibroblasts (103,104).

        <p>Engagement of the innate immune system depends on 13 different TLRs, which are not antigen-specific but instead recognize patterns and which segregate on the basis of the nature of the ligands they encounter such as distinct molecular patterns in particular pathogens, in endogenous cellular constituents, or in cellular products of the host [reviewed in Ref. (155)]. Considerable evidence suggests that TLR2 and TLR4 expressed on cells and IC TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 have particular relevance to SSc pathogenesis. For example, a rare functional polymorphism (Pro 631 His) in TLR2 (which has bacterial peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, and lipoteichoic acid and yeast-derived zymosan as natural ligands) is associated with ATA positivity and enhanced IL-6 production by dendritic cells when engaged by a TLR2 ligand (90,155). TLR4 endogenous ligands [including fibronectin, hyaluronan fragments, heat-shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP9, high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), and S100A proteins] could engage TLR4 (which is increased in SSc skin and lungs) and synergize with TGF-β to increase fibroblast CI production (155)(156)(157)(158)(159)(160). Importantly, HSP70, HMGB-1, and hyaluronan are elevated in SSc sera or tissues (161)(162)(163). Of interest, elevated HMGB-1 and soluble advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) levels in sera of patients with SSc correlated with more internal organ involvement, immunological abnormalities, and total MRSS but correlated negatively with lung function (161). Double-stranded RNA is recognized by TLR3, single-stranded RNA, and imidazoquinoline compounds by TLR7 and TLR8, whereas unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide sequences are recognized by TLR9 and some of these ligands are present in SSc (164,165).Engagement of the innate immune system depends on 13 different TLRs, which are not antigen-specific but instead recognize patterns and which segregate on the basis of the nature of the ligands they encounter such as distinct molecular patterns in particular pathogens, in endogenous cellular constituents, or in cellular products of the host [reviewed in Ref.

        <p>Siglec-1 (CD169, sialoadhesin) is a marker for macrophage activation and its expression was found to be increased CD14 + monocytes in peripheral blood and on macrophages in dermis of lesional skin of a subset of patients with SSc (125). Furthermore, Siglec-1 was induced in peripheral blood CD14 + monocytes from normal donors when cultured with IFNα, TLR3, 7, or 9 agonists but not by TLR2 or 4 (125). In the skin, activated macrophages expressing Siglec-1 may also release cytokines or growth factors that are able to stimulate fibroblasts or myofibroblasts to synthesize CIs and other matrix components (125). In addition, sera containing autoantibodies from patients with SSc induce high levels of IFNα in normal monocytes that is inhibited by pretreatment of the sera with bafilomycin and RNA-degrading enzymes, suggesting that the immune complexes in SSc sera contain RNA that can bind IC TLRs (166). While other agents (e.g., IL-4, LSP, IFNβ, IFNγ) might also induce Siglec-1 expression on monocytes/macrophages in SSc, these findings are compatible with the notion that generations of IFNα by activation of IC TLRs 3, 7, or 9 agonists might be ongoing in a subset of SSc patients (125,167).Siglec-1 (CD169, sialoadhesin) is a marker for macrophage activation and its expression was found to be increased CD14 + monocytes in peripheral blood and on macrophages in dermis of lesional skin of a subset of patients with SSc (125).

        <p>iRFSNP Associations IFN regulatory factor 5, a major regulator of type 1-IFN, induces the transcription of IFN-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, is involved in TLR signaling, and is critical for activation of IFNassociated genes (109, 169) (see Table 3). IRF5 has association with SLE (171)(172)(173), and multiple studies have shown SNPs of IRF5 are associated with SSc susceptibility. IRF5 rs2004640*TT was found to have a strong association with dcSSc, fibrosing alveolitis, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and ATA positivity in a French cohort (38). In addition to rs2004640, these same authors found an association between rs3757385 and rs10954213 variants and SSc (43). In this study, IRF5 haplotype "R" was identified as a risk while haplotype "P" was protective (43). A Japanese case-control association study with 281 SSc and 477 controls found that rs2004640, rs10954213, and rs2280714 were all significantly associated with SSc, with rs2280714 having the strongest association with SSc, and these SNPs were significantly enriched in dcSSc and ATApositive patients (45). Carmona et al. found that SNPs rs10488631, rs2004640, and rs4728142 showed strong associations in SSc global disease, and that association of rs20004640 was dependent on rs4728142 (174). rs728142*A-rs2004640*T haplotype explained this association suggesting that all three haplotypes provide an additive effect (174). In another study, IRF5 SNP rs4728142 was found to be predictive of longer survival in SSc patients with ILD (41). IRF7 is upregulated in peripheral blood cells from patients with early SSc and is associated with ACA-positive SSc (175). IRF8 is induced by IFNγ and modulates TLR signaling (24). Polymorphism rs11642873 in the IRF8 gene was found to be associated with lcSSc (24). IRF8 SNP rs2280381 was found to have association with SSc in a Japanese population consisting of 415 SSc and 16,891 controls with a replication study consisting of 315 SSc (68). While associations of the above variations in IRF genes with certain manifestations do not establish cause and effect, they suggest genes that regulate IFN expression and downstream effects may play a central role in determining disease severity and specific organ involvement.iRFSNP Associations IFN regulatory factor 5, a major regulator of type 1-IFN, induces the transcription of IFN-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, is involved in TLR signaling, and is critical for activation of IFNassociated genes (109, 169) (see Table 3).

Carmona et al. found that SNPs rs10488631, rs2004640, and rs4728142 showed strong associations in SSc global disease, and that association of rs20004640 was dependent on rs4728142 (174). rs728142*A-rs2004640*T haplotype explained this association suggesting that all three haplotypes provide an additive effect (174). In another study, IRF5 SNP rs4728142 was found to be predictive of longer survival in SSc patients with ILD (41). IRF7 is upregulated in peripheral blood cells from patients with early SSc and is associated with ACA-positive SSc (175). IRF8 is induced by IFNγ and modulates TLR signaling (24). Polymorphism rs11642873 in the IRF8 gene was found to be associated with lcSSc (24). IRF8 SNP rs2280381 was found to have association with SSc in a Japanese population consisting of 415 SSc and 16,891 controls with a replication study consisting of 315 SSc (68). While associations of the above variations in IRF genes with certain manifestations do not establish cause and effect, they suggest genes that regulate IFN expression and downstream effects may play a central role in determining disease severity and specific organ involvement.</p>
        <p>The cytoplasm of cells also contains another pattern recognition receptor (PRR) system called the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family that recognize IC motifs and, when activated via the "inflammasome" involves NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which in turn stimulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and IL-18. Polymorphisms of one of the NOD family members, NLRP1, are associated with ILD and ATA positivity in patients with SSc (176). Relevance of the NOD family to SSc was further evidenced by studies showing inhibition of inflammatory activation-reduced IL-1β and CI production by SSc lesional fibroblasts and studies in NALP3 null mice showing they were resistant to lung fibrosis (177,178). NLRP3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) were found to be increased in skin biopsies of patients with dcSSc or lcSSc compared to age-matched control and correlated with MRSS (179).The cytoplasm of cells also contains another pattern recognition receptor (PRR) system called the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family that recognize IC motifs and, when activated via the "inflammasome" involves NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which in turn stimulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and IL-18.

        <p>Rather than two separate and mutually exclusive immune systems, it is being realized that there is likely an ongoing interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems (180). Attention has focused on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are involved not only in immediate immune host defense but also in maintaining homeostasis of mucosal and lymphoid tissue (180,181). Three different types of ILCs have been described to-date: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 (181). These ILCs do not express somatically rearranged antigen receptors, but express MHC Class-II and possess transcription factors and cytokine profiles reminiscent of Th cells (181,182). ILC1s, like Th1 cells, utilize T-bet and produce IFNγ; ILC2s, like Th2 cells, utilize GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) and produce IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13; and ILC3s, like Th17 cells, utilize RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma transcription factor (RORγt) and produce IL-17A and IL-22 (181). ILCs express TLRs and IL-1 receptor, and ILC2s and ILC3s can act as APC similar to dendritic cells (181,183,184). In mouse models, ILC3s were shown to promote antigen-specific CD4 + T cells and antigenspecific T-cell-dependent B-cell antibody production (181). What role ILCs play in innate and adaptive immunity in SSc remains to be defined and ongoing research should eventually better elucidate how ILC effect transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Dendritic cells by using surfaces and IC PRRs play key roles in linking innate immune response to adaptive immune responses by identifying antigens from pathogen-associated or damageassociated molecular patterns (PAMPS or DAMPS) by using TLRs, NLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (185). The identified antigens are then processed and the information is presented to T cells in the context of MHC-II/antigen complex binding the T-cell receptor, CD86/CD80 costimulation of T-cell CD28, followed by release of cytokines from dendritic cells that affect T-cell differentiation and effect Th1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cell differentiation (185,186).Rather than two separate and mutually exclusive immune systems, it is being realized that there is likely an ongoing interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems (180).

        <p>Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency has been implicated in triggering and enhancing a number of autoimmune diseases. Low serum 25(OH)D concentrations have been reported to be more common in patients with SSc than in healthy controls. Furthermore, 25(OH) D levels have been reported to negatively correlate with several laboratory and clinical parameters in European Disease Activity Score, Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, MRSS, and positively correlate with carbon monoxide diffusion lung capacity (216)(217)(218). A number of effects of 1,25(OH) 2 D3 on immune cells have been reported that could explain its ability to decrease autoimmunity and, conversely, how VitD deficiency contributes to increased autoimmunity [these are summarized in Ref. (219)]. For example, effects of 1,25(OH) 2 D3 on APC include: (1) downregulation of MHC class-II molecule expression in APC; (2) downregulation of surface expression of co-stimulatory receptors (CD40, CD80, and CD86) and other maturation-induced proteins (CD1a, CD83); (3) inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, induction of tolerogenic DC that are able to induce Treg cells; (4) inhibition of IL-12 p70 release from DC; and (5) inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and macrophages (219).

        <p>Administration of VitD3 in escalating daily doses of 2000 U (2000 U for the first month, then 4000 U for the second month, and 8000 U for the third month) to healthy VitD-deficient individuals induced increased frequencies of CD38 + B cells and reduced frequencies of CD4 + IFNγ + and CD4 + IL-17 + T-helper cells (221). Treatment of SLE patients with hypovitaminosis D with 100,000 U of VitD3 weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly Lysophosphatidic acid and S1P levels are increased in sera of patients with SSc, suggesting they may play a role in different aspects of the disease (214) [reviewed in Ref. (223)]. Platelets, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and endothelial cells are sources of LPA and S1P, and these cells (plus T cells and B cells), NK cells, fibroblasts, and other cells express various types of LPA and S1P G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [reviewed in Ref. (223)]. PPARγ, which resides intracellularly and counters TGF-β fibrogenesis, is also an additional receptor for LPA (224). In addition to S1P being able to "disarm" Foxp3 Tregs mentioned above, S1P and LPA regulate the function, migration, and trafficking of all lymphoid cells and monocyte/macrophage/dendritic cells with S1P also being able to sequester T cells in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs, resulting in some instances in lymphopenia, which is frequently found in patients with SSc (225)(226)(227). By acting on APC, S1P and LPA each can suppress development of Th1 T-helper cells, but they have different effects on Th2 T-helper cells in that S1P suppresses their development while LPA fosters their development (228). Th2 T-helper cell predominance is a feature of some patients with SSc with production of IL-4 and IL-13, which facilitate development and expansion of B cells and autoantibodies that are common features of SSc.

The various vascular abnormalities are summarized in Table 5.

        <p>Earliest signs of vascular dysfunction include impaired vascular tone and vascular permeability (234). Impaired balance of vasoconstrictor substances (e.g., ET) and vasodilator substances (e.g., NO), plays important roles in vascular dysfunction. Platelet activation and enhanced coagulation with reduced fibrinolysis also contribute to the vasculopathy in SSc. Abnormalities in the vascular system can be seen in clinically normal skin of SSc patients (235). Large gaps between endothelial cells, vacuolization of endothelial cell cytoplasm, and loss of membrane-bound storage vesicles are some of the earliest detectable changes in the endothelial cells (235)(236)(237). In a 20-year follow-up study, sequential changes can be seen in capillaries (4) in skin, which include capillary enlargement, capillary loss, and telangiectasia. Further morphologic changes in vessel wall occur including fibrosis. Such capillary changes are wide spread in internal organs (e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, and muscles) (238). Intimal proliferation and accumulation of proteoglycans in the arterioles and small arteries are also common (239,240).

        <p>Evidence suggests that endothelial cell injury is an early and central event in the pathogenesis of SSc vasculopathy, and viral agents [especially human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)], cytotoxic T cells, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antiendothelial cell antibodies, and ischemia-reperfusion injury are all suggested mechanisms for endothelial cell damage (234,242). Levels of antibodies to hCMV are increased in patients with SSc which is reminiscent of the association of hCMV antibodies with vascular intimal proliferation and vasculopathy in patients with graft rejection and coronary artery bypass restenosis (243). In addition, there is evidence of binding of some ATAs to an epitope in hCMV-derived UL94 protein which happens to also show homology to MVEC surface protein tetraspan novel antigen-2 (NAG-2) (243).

        <p>Presence of proliferative vasculopathy with intimal proliferation in peripheral, pulmonary, coronary, and renal arteries in the absence of inflammation is a hallmark feature of scleroderma Endothelial cell damage is a key and early process. It precedes fibrosis and particularly involves the arterioles Early detectable changes in the endothelial cells include disappearance of membrane-bound vesicles, vacuolization of endothelial cell cytoplasm, and gaps between endothelial cells Defective angiogenesis is an early event in the form of drop out of capillaries and abnormal capillary architecture without a compensatory process There are conflicting reports regarding the presence and role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in SSc There is dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis process T cells, NK, and LAK cells which utilize the granzyme/perforin system (243). ADCC to MVEC is operative in many patients with SSc (243). Anti-endothelial cell antibodies are commonly found in sera from patients with SSc and are capable of inducing MVEC apoptosis directly in vitro (245). Ischemia and reperfusion injury (especially associated with attacks of RP) is accompanied by upregulation of expression of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). This upregulation indicates endothelial dysfunction and allows attachment of platelets and neutrophils to the endothelium that is thought to lead to MVEC injury through production of superoxide radicals (which limit release of vasodilation substances such as NO and prostacyclin) (243,246,247). The major evidence for the presence of the endothelial injury in SSc is high serum levels of circulating von Willebrand (VW) factor, ET-1, increased levels of circulating viable and dead endothelial cells, and soluble JAM-A and JAM-C (234,(247)(248)(249)(250)(251). Subendothelial tissue forms a nidus for platelets to aggregate and initiates fibrin deposition and intravascular thrombus formation (1). The role of endothelial apoptosis is not clear. Sgonc et al. ( 252) demonstrated endothelial cell apoptosis in the University of California at Davis chicken lines 200/206, which spontaneously develop an SSc-like disease (252). Apoptotic endothelial cells may contribute to tissue injury when engulfed by immature dendritic cells and macrophages, which subsequently present cellular antigens to CD8 + T cells, causing further tissue injury (253). These apoptotic endothelial cells can also activate the alternate complement pathway and coagulant pathway leading to vasculopathy (254,255). Proof that there is ongoing endothelial apoptosis in SSc is thus far lacking, and Fleming and Wanless ( 256) failed to detect apoptotic endothelial cells in their study, although they did demonstrate loss of VE-cadherin, which regulates endothelial barrier function and found evidence of IFNα signaling (256). IFNα signaling suggests endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in these cells (257,258).Presence of proliferative vasculopathy with intimal proliferation in peripheral, pulmonary, coronary, and renal arteries in the absence of inflammation is a hallmark feature of scleroderma Endothelial cell damage is a key and early process. It precedes fibrosis and particularly involves the arterioles Early detectable changes in the endothelial cells include disappearance of membrane-bound vesicles, vacuolization of endothelial cell cytoplasm, and gaps between endothelial cells Defective angiogenesis is an early event in the form of drop out of capillaries and abnormal capillary architecture without a compensatory process There are conflicting reports regarding the presence and role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in SSc There is dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis process T cells, NK, and LAK cells which utilize the granzyme/perforin system (243). ADCC to MVEC is operative in many patients with SSc (243). Anti-endothelial cell antibodies are commonly found in sera from patients with SSc and are capable of inducing MVEC apoptosis directly in vitro (245). Ischemia and reperfusion injury (especially associated with attacks of RP) is accompanied by upregulation of expression of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). This upregulation indicates endothelial dysfunction and allows attachment of platelets and neutrophils to the endothelium that is thought to lead to MVEC injury through production of superoxide radicals (which limit release of vasodilation substances such as NO and prostacyclin) (243,246,247). The major evidence for the presence of the endothelial injury in SSc is high serum levels of circulating von Willebrand (VW) factor, ET-1, increased levels of circulating viable and dead endothelial cells, and soluble JAM-A and JAM-C (234,(247)(248)(249)(250)(251). Subendothelial tissue forms a nidus for platelets to aggregate and initiates fibrin deposition and intravascular thrombus formation (1). The role of endothelial apoptosis is not clear. Sgonc et al. ( 252) demonstrated endothelial cell apoptosis in the University of California at Davis chicken lines 200/206, which spontaneously develop an SSc-like disease (252).

        <p>The remarkable loss of capillaries and small vessels in patients with SSc suggests a defect in the process of angiogenesis. Tissue ischemia usually leads to the expression of angiogenic growth factors [e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], which causes vasodilatation, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells and stabilization of the lumina to form new vessels (259). Plasma levels of VEGF are elevated in SSc, and this could stimulate angiogenesis (260). Levels of other proangiogenic factors [e.g., PDGF, placental growth factor (PGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)] are also considerably elevated in the plasma of SSc patients (261). Expression of VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, are increased in skin of SSc patients (260,262,263). In addition to elevated level of VEGF, other proangiogenic mediators (such as ET-1, adhesion molecules, and chemokines) are found in the circulation of SSc patients (264). Elevated levels of antiangiogenic factors such as angiostatin, platelet factor-4 (also called CXCL4), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and IL-4 have been described in patients with SSc (264,265).The remarkable loss of capillaries and small vessels in patients with SSc suggests a defect in the process of angiogenesis.

        <p>The role of vasculogenesis in SSc is not clear, and there are conflicting reports regarding the presence and role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in SSc (266). Increased levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells have been demonstrated which supports their mobilization from bone marrow (267). However, in another study, there were substantially reduced numbers of bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial precursors compared to healthy subjects or patients with RA. The lowest number of these cells was observed in SSc patients with active fingertip ulcers, and this may suggest inadequate recruitment of these precursor cells and impaired vascular repair mechanisms (268). Atorvastatin can be effective in RP -perhaps by increasing the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, which suggests a role of endothelial progenitor cells in vascular dysfunction (269).The role of vasculogenesis in SSc is not clear, and there are conflicting reports regarding the presence and role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in SSc (266).

They can further differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts (273)(274)(275). Pericytes express PDGFR-β, and high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) in vascular lesions in SSc patients with associated RP and ANA (276). Another marker of angiogenic pericytes is regulator of G protein signaling (RGS-5), which is highly expressed in SSc vasculature (277). The exact role of RGS-5 is not clear, but it can negatively regulate vessel maturation (278).

        <p>There is subendothelial accumulation of activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts and production of excessive CI and ECM components in blood vessels of SSc patients (1). During this process, endothelial cells lose their specific markers such as VE-cadherin and VW factor and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype expressing α smooth muscle actin (αSMA), Vimentin, and CI. It is postulated that endothelial cells might transform into mesenchymal cells induced by local growth factors and cytokines (1). The exact molecular mechanism and the cytokines involved are not known, but TGF-β has been implicated. There are recent reports of TGF-β being involved in various disease processes such as endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (280)(281)(282)(283)(284). Li and Jimenez (285) further examined the role of TGF-β in the transformation process and the signaling pathways involved (285) in a murine pulmonary endothelial cell model. They concluded that TGF-β could lead to mesenchymal transformation of the endothelial cells. They further demonstrated that the transformation is associated with strong upregulation of transcriptional repressor snail-1 and is mediated by the c-abl kinase and protein kinase C-δ. Snail-1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that forms a complex with Smad3/Smad4 (1). Snail-1 induces numerous transcriptional events that could lead to expression of a mesenchymal phenotype. Besides this, Wnt signaling as well as NOTCH signaling pathways might be involved in this endothelial-mesenchymal transformation process (1). Other potential mediators of this transformative process include PDGF (286), VEGF (287), insulin-derived growth factor (288), CTGF (289), ET-1 (290), and miRNAs (291,292).

        <p>In SSc, there is a reduction in eNOS gene expression and NO release in SSc and MVEC derived from lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies in the steady-state and after shear stress (295). This is probably associated with deficient endothelium-dependent relaxation in SSc (296). Impaired NO results in alteration of vascular tone, enhancement of platelet aggregation, and increased susceptibility of endothelial cells to oxidative injury. NO also limits cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation and monocyte adhesion and inhibits the endothelial cell release of IL-6 and IL-8, which are important inflammatory cytokines (297). Further, NO inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through elevation of cyclic GMP and inhibition of mitogenic proteins, TGF-β and PDGF. Therefore, impaired NO production in SSc may contribute to the pathogenesis of arteriolar intimal proliferation and may have a prominent role in pathophysiology of the disease.In SSc, there is a reduction in eNOS gene expression and NO release in SSc and MVEC derived from lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies in the steady-state and after shear stress (295).

        <p>Plasmin has both pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic properties [profibrotic by activating TGF-β and anti-fibrotic by activating both hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MMPs] (304,305). Plasmin is inactivated via formation of a complex with α2-antiplasmin (α2AP), and elevated levels of plasmin-α2AP are associated with several fibrotic conditions including SSc (306). α2AP promotes fibrosis by activating phospholipase A 2 by binding to adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) to generate PGF 2 α, which in turn stimulates production of TGF-β (307). Levels of α2AP are elevated in lesional BLM skin in mice, which is induced by CTGF via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and JNK pathways (308). α2AP induces αSMA + myofibroblasts in vitro and mice with deletion of α zinc-finger alpha protein gene (αZAP) exhibit less infiltration of myofibroblasts at the site of BLM injections in the skin (308). Plasmin increases ECM degradation, and inhibition of plasmin of α2AP decreases ECM degradation, which could be another mechanism by which α2AP could promote fibrosis.Plasmin has both pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic properties [profibrotic by activating TGF-β and anti-fibrotic by activating both hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MMPs] (304,305).

        <p>Chronic activation of platelets and their released products could contribute to the vascular, immunologic, and connective tissue pathology of SSc (309).

ET-1 and S1P cause vasoconstriction by engaging S1P 2 and S1P 3 receptors (312). In the human fetal lung fibroblast line (FH-1), S1P utilizes S1P 1 receptors to inhibit TGF-β1-induced αSMA expression while utilizing S1P 3 receptors to stimulate αSMA expression (313). Sera from patients with SSc have elevated levels of arachidonoyl-LPA and S1P (214).

        <p>interferon Signature in SSc-PAH Type I IFNs are implicated by the association of use of IFNα in the treatment of hepatitis and of IFNβ in the treatment of MS with development of PAH (118,119). Diseases in which there is an "IFN signature" (such as SLE, SSc, and infection with HIV) are associated with development of PAH (120)(121)(122)(123)(124). Furthermore, IFNα and IFNγ (added to cultures of human PASMC primed with TNFα or to cultures of human lung MVEC or human lung fibroblasts) cause release of the potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1, and of IP-10 (117). In a series of 128 SSc patients with PAH and 35 patients with no PAH, the SSc patients with PAH had higher levels of IP-10 and ET-1 in their sera compared to SSc patients without PAH or compared to healthy controls; more SSc patients with PAH had detectable levels of IFNα and IFNγ in their sera than SSc patients without PAH (117). In this series of SSc patients, levels of TNFα, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-8 were significantly higher in sera in SSc patients with PAH when compared to SSc patients without PAH (117). Additional studies of this patient group revealed that serum levels of IP-10 in the SSc-PAH patients correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance, and levels of brain natriuretic peptide in serum, and serum IP-10 levels in the SSc-PAH patients inversely correlated with cardiac index and 6-min walks test (117). Sections of lung from patients with IPAH or with SSc-PAH expressed higher levels of IFNR1 in endothelium, smooth muscle layer, vascular interstitium, and in intravascular inflammatory cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting (117). While the above studies strongly implicated type I IFN as playing a pathogenic role in SSc-PAH and IPAH, further evidence was substantiated in the type I IFN α receptor 1 knockout mouse which was found to be resistant to experimental hypoxic PAH induction. These mice did not have elevated serum levels of ET-1 when compared to WT control mice (117). Analysis of PBMC from patients with SSc revealed Siglec-1 and other IFN-regulated genes were overexpressed in patients with dcSSc, whereas patients with lcSSc with PAH overexpressed IL-13RA1, ICAM-1, CCR1, JAK2, and MCR1 (123,125,126). IL-13 was also elevated to higher levels in sera of patients with lcSSc with PAH, and MCR1 was induced on CD14 + monocytes suggesting monocytes are activated in lcSSc patients with PAH of an alternative (i.e., IL-4/IL-13) rather than classical (i.e., IFNγ/LPS) pathway (123).interferon Signature in SSc-PAH Type I IFNs are implicated by the association of use of IFNα in the treatment of hepatitis and of IFNβ in the treatment of MS with development of PAH (118,119). Diseases in which there is an "IFN signature" (such as SLE, SSc, and infection with HIV) are associated with development of PAH (120)(121)(122)(123)(124). Furthermore, IFNα and IFNγ (added to cultures of human PASMC primed with TNFα or to cultures of human lung MVEC or human lung fibroblasts) cause release of the potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1, and of IP-10 (117). In a series of 128 SSc patients with PAH and 35 patients with no PAH, the SSc patients with PAH had higher levels of IP-10 and ET-1 in their sera compared to SSc patients without PAH or compared to healthy controls; more SSc patients with PAH had detectable levels of IFNα and IFNγ in their sera than SSc patients without PAH (117). In this series of SSc patients, levels of TNFα, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-8 were significantly higher in sera in SSc patients with PAH when compared to SSc patients without PAH (117).

For example, there is overexpression of VE-cadherin, IFNα signaling, and Rgs-5, which is associated with an antiangiogenic phenotype (188). Overexpression of Rgs-5 may reduce signaling via S1P 1 receptor and increase S1P signaling through other S1P receptors that could reduce endothelial eNOS, increase vasoconstriction, increase vascular leakiness, and reduce angiogenesis [reviewed in Ref.

        <p>Earlier studies indicated that normal human dermal fibroblasts (grown for prolonged periods of time in vitro in the presence of culture medium supplemented with culture supernatants obtained by activating normal human donor peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes with T-cell mitogen in vitro) acquired a "scleroderma-like phenotype" that resembled cultured lesional SSc skin fibroblasts at the ultrastructure level with respect to excessive production of glycosaminoglycans (346). A phenotypic characteristic of cultured SSc lesional skin fibroblasts is that they produce reduced levels of MMP-1, an enzyme necessary for degradation of triple helical CI and CIII (347). Some SSc lesional fibroblasts regain production of MMP-1 after several subpassages, and when these fibroblasts lines are then cultured for 3 weeks with IL-13 or PDGF-BB, then cultured in plain medium before TNFα stimulation, the production of MMP-1 in response to TNF-α stimulation is markedly reduced compared to normal donor fibroblasts similarly treated with IL-13 or PDGF-BB (348). These studies suggest that in vivo chronic exposure of SSc fibroblasts to certain cytokines, derived from activated lymphocytes and monocytes either in circulation or from lymphocytes/monocytes infiltrating SSc lesional skin, can induce an SSc fibroblast phenotype that persists in the absence of the cytokines for some period of time. Platelets that are being chronically activated/aggregated in patients with SSc may also contribute some cytokines/growth factors (e.g., PDGF-BB) that could contribute to induction of the scleroderma fibroblast phenotype (309).Earlier studies indicated that normal human dermal fibroblasts (grown for prolonged periods of time in vitro in the presence of culture medium supplemented with culture supernatants obtained by activating normal human donor peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes with T-cell mitogen in vitro) acquired a "scleroderma-like phenotype" that resembled cultured lesional SSc skin fibroblasts at the ultrastructure level with respect to excessive production of glycosaminoglycans (346).

        <p>Fibroblasts cultured from lesional skin biopsies of patients with SSc contain increased numbers of myofibroblasts and synthesize increased amounts of CI and TIMP-1, in contrast to fibroblasts grown from non-lesional SSc skin or skin of healthy controls (349). This increased CI production phenotype reverts toward normal as the SSc lesional fibroblasts in culture are passaged, as shown by LeRoy (350). The myofibroblasts in SSc lesional skin contain αSMA and fibronectin ED-A splice variant, the latter being a requirement for TGF-β1 to induce myofibroblast formation (275,351). In normal wound healing, myofibroblasts contract the newly formed ECM, and their development and function are modulated by mechanical forces and stiffness of the ECM microenvironment (352). The origin of myofibroblasts in SSc lesional skin is not completely understood, but likely candidates include resident connective tissue fibroblasts, epithelial cells, pericytes, and circulating fibrocytes.

        <p>A great deal of effort has elucidated the complex receptor engagement and signaling of TGF-β and its 1, 2, and 3 isotypes that occur in mammals and which have been the topic of several recent reviews (364)(365)(366)(367). TGF-β1, 2, and 3 are synthesized as inactive propeptides which have to be cleaved intracellularly by the protease, farin, to generate active 25 kDa MW, active TGF-β1, 2, or 3. The active TGF-β is bound by the cleaved amino terminal peptide called "latency-associated peptide" (LAP) and, in connective tissue, the latent TGF-β1-LAP complex is bound to latent TGF-β1-binding protein (LTBP), which is termed "large latent complex" (LLC) (365,368). Latent TGF-β can be activated by interaction with integrins and by several proteases such as thrombin, plasma transglutaminase, cathepsin D, and plasmin (369). There are three classes of TGF-β receptors. TGF-β receptor 1 has two forms: ALK1 (found mainly in endothelial cells) and ALK5 (which is present in most cells) (367). TGF-β receptor 2 forms a heteromeric complex with type 1 receptors and phosphorylates it, setting in motion IC signaling via receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) which are type 1 receptor specific [i.e., ALK1 causes Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation while the predominant ALK5 causes Smad2/3 phosphorylation (367)]. The phosphorylated R-Smads complex with Smad4 and in the nucleus interact with co-activators [e.g., CREB-binding protein (CBP)/ p300] and co-expressors (e.g., Ski/Sno) to transcriptionally activate or repress target genes (367). Inhibitory Smads (Smad 6 and 7) can bind to TGF-β type 1 receptors and to Smad4 or effect ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (367). A coreceptor called endoglin, of which there are two spliced variants called short and long forms, can (under different conditions by interacting with ALK1 or ALK5) decrease or enhance TGF-β signaling, respectively (367). Betaglyan ("type 3" TGF-β receptor) can also act as a coreceptor by facilitating TGF-β binding/ interaction with type 1 and 2 TG-β receptors (370). CTGF can also interact with TGF-β type 1 and 2 receptors and facilitate Smad3 signaling, which has a pro-fibrotic effect (367). Other members of the TGF-β superfamily including Activin (A, B, and AB), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and growth differentiation factors utilize components of the TGF-β receptor complex (366). In addition to the canonical Smad-dependent pathway described above, TGF-β can signal through non-canonical Smadindependent Wnt, MAPK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT, and Rho-like GTPase pathways (366).

In addition, IL-13 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGF-BP-5) have been shown to induce Egr-1 expression by MAPK signaling pathway (375). Other extracellular signals which are relevant to SSc [such as PDGF, hypoxia, HGF, or LPS (bacterial LPS), oxidative stress, thrombin, LPA, ultraviolet light, cigarette smoke, mechanical strength, ischemia-reperfusion, and T-cell receptor ligature] have been shown to increase Egr-1 expression (373).

        <p>Bone morphogenic protein-7, although a member of the TGF-β superfamily, stimulates fibroblast chemotaxis like TGF-β1, but does not induce CI, fibronectin, hyaluronan, or TIMP synthesis (377). BMP-7 also inhibits fibrogenic properties of TGF-β1 (378) and signals through a receptor complex structurally different from that of TGF-β and utilizes SMAD1/5/8 (365). IL-10 inhibits both proliferation and CI synthesis by fibroblasts (379). Certain IL-10 genotypes have been associated with development of SSc in Caucasian and Japanese subjects (380). TNFα inhibits CI, stimulates MMP-1 synthesis by fibroblasts, and is a potent chemoattractant for these cells (381). IFNγ is a potent inhibitor of expression of CI and CIII mRNA and protein by cultured SSc fibroblasts in vitro (382). To what extent BMP-7, TNFα, IL-10, IFNγ, or other antifibrotic mediators or mechanisms try to counter the drivers of fibrosis such as TGF-β, IL-4/IL-13, IL-6/IL-6R-Gremlin-1 in SSc is unknown but provides candidates to be the focus of future studies. Effect of blocking TNFα with etanercept was assessed in the BLM scleroderma mouse model. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, the etanercept-treated mice had less dermal fibrosis and lower serum levels of TGF-β1 than controls not treated with etanercept (383).

        <p>The fibrogenic role of TGF-β, IL-13/IL-4, and Egr-1 in patients with SSc has been assessed by performing genome-wide gene expression studies on lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies from patients with dcSSc, lcSSc, morphea, and healthy controls. These studies show four intrinsic subsets of gene expression termed "diffuse proliferation" (further divided into diffuse1 and diffuse2) and containing only dcSSc patients; inflammatory group containing dcSSc, lcSSc, and morphea; limited group containing lcSSc; and a normal-like group containing normal, dcSSc, and lcSSc patients (386). Further comparisons were made subjecting TGF-β, IL-13/ IL-4, and Egr-1-stimulated normal dermal fibroblasts in culture to gene expression microarray analysis and comparing these fibroblast microarrays to gene expression arrays of biopsies of skin from SSc, morphea, and normal donors. TGF-β responsive gene signature was found in 10 out of 17 patients with dcSSc (59%) and none of 7 lcSSc, none of 3 morphea, and none of 6 healthy controls (387). The dcSSc patients with the TGF-β-responsive signature had higher MRSS and likelihood of having ILD (387). The TGF-β signaturepositive dcSSc patients also were in the diffuse-proliferation subset; however, one in the diffuse-proliferation subset did not have the TGF-β signature. This suggests that only a subset (and not all) SSc patients have the TGF-β signature. The fibroblast Egr-1-responsive gene signature was present in the skin biopsies from diffuse-proliferation subset of dcSSc patients, but was not present in biopsies of patients with lcSSc, morphea, or healthy controls (388). The IL-4 response signature overlapped approximately 60% with the IL-13 response signature, which were both enriched in the SSc inflammatory subset (389). Expression in skin biopsies from SSc patients of the IL-13 pathway activation [as well as transcripts of IL-13 receptor components (IL-13RA1 and IL-4RA)] correlated with MRSS (389). Expression of CCL2 (MCP-1) transcripts also correlated with MRSS and IL-13RA1 (389). This study also assessed gene expression profiling in skin of a sclerodermatous graft-versus-host disease (scl GVHD) model in Rag2 -/-mice, which were found to also exhibit the IL-13 pathway activation resembling that in SSc patients of inflammatory subset (389). This observation is interesting, given that it has been hypothesized that fetal-maternal or maternal-fetal microchimerism might induce a cGVHD state in some patients with SSc as described above. Since IL-6 and IL-6R induces Gremlin-1 protein (which then signals through the canonical Smad-dependent pathway), it raises the question as to whether some of the TGF-β signature in the dcSSc diffuse-proliferation subset (discussed above) is actually due to Gremlin-1. Further studies would need to be done comparing Gremlin-1-induced gene signature in dermal fibroblasts with that of TGF-β1 to sort this out.The fibrogenic role of TGF-β, IL-13/IL-4, and Egr-1 in patients with SSc has been assessed by performing genome-wide gene expression studies on lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies from patients with dcSSc, lcSSc, morphea, and healthy controls.

Results showed IFNα signaling was strongly associated with early disease, compatible with the notion that innate immune response may be a feature in early disease which was contrasted with TGF-β signaling being a feature of later disease with worse MRSS (390). Surprisingly, PDGF signaling was most strongly associated with the fibroproliferative subset (more so than TGF-β), and the inflammatory subset exhibited strong activation of innate immune pathways including enrichment of IL-4, S1P, NFκB, LPS, poly(I-C), and TGF-β gene signatures (390). The findings support an earlier hypothesis by Gabrielli et al. that a stepwise process of SSc development begins with inflammatory (e.g., IFNα signaling) and continues with fibrosis (e.g., PDGF and TGF-β signaling) and ends in atrophy (391).

        <p>Most patients with dcSSc have some resolution with the passage of time of dermal fibrosis after the onset of their disease. This has been observed in several different studies clinically as decreases in the MRSS. In a large, single SSc center in the UK, 131 patients with dcSSc had MRSS measured repeatedly up to 36 months after onset of their disease (392). Three patterns were discernable as follows: those with high baseline MRSS that did not improve over 36 months from baseline (38%); those with high baseline MRSS that improved over 36 months from baseline (21%); and those with low baseline MRSS that improved over 36 months from baseline (35%). The reason for these three clinical trajectories of change in MRSS over time is not apparent, but could be a function of different genetic backgrounds, different triggers, or other environmental modifications that either ameliorate or contribute to perpetuation of the disease. The patients received different medications; however, clinical MRSS response or survival could not be attributed to any of the medications (392). The fact that most of these patients with dcSSc had improvement in their MRSS suggests that the myofibroblast phenotype responsible for excessive ECM deposition does not persist, that the fibrotic skin can revert toward normal, and that a normal-like homeostasis can be re-established in such patients.

        <p>Studies using a mouse mesenchymal multipotent cell line revealed that 1,25(OH) 2 D3 promoted increased expression and nuclear translocation of the VDR; decreased expression of TGF-β1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (SERPINE 1); decreased expression of CI I, III, and other CI isoforms; and increased expression of several other antifibrotic factors including BMP-7, MMP-8, and follistatin [an inhibitor of the pro-fibrotic factor, myostatin (411)].

Unlike VitD3, 25(OH)D3, or 1,25(OH) 2 D3, these novel endogenously produced VitD analogs are non-calcemic when given in high doses to mice. 20(OH)D3 also suppressed development of dermal fibrosis in the BLM, scleroderma mouse model (413).

        <p>Lysophosphatidic acid induces fibroblast chemotaxis and proliferation (414). LPA induces αvβ6 integrin-mediated TGF-β activation by engaging LPA 2 receptors on epithelial cells and makes fibroblasts resistant to apoptosis, which is a characteristic of SSc lesional fibroblasts that would prolong their survival (415,416). Evidence that LPA is involved in myofibroblast formation in SSc lesional skin was suggested by the finding that fibroblasts cultured from skin of SSc patients exhibited increased LPA-activated chloride current, which is a hallmark of LPA-induced myofibroblasts (417). AMO95: a selective small molecule inhibitor of LPA 1 signaling (AMO95) protected mice from developing BLM-induced skin fibrosis and increased regression of established BLM-induced skin fibrosis (418). Contrary to the results in the BLM skin fibrosis model in which LPA 2 knockout did not affect dermal fibrosis, in the BLM lung fibrosis model, LPA 2 knockout mice exhibited reduced lung injury, fibrosis, and fibronectin deposition in BLM-treated lungs (419). S1P facilitates migration of fibroblasts in response to a chemotactic gradient of fibronectin in a S1P 2 receptor-dependent manner (420). S1P signals through the Smad pathway utilized by TGF-β1 in fibroblasts and other cell types and mimics TGF-β1 pro-fibrotic effects in that it decreases MMP-1 and increases TIMP and CI production by fibroblasts (421)(422)(423). SSc dermal fibroblasts express more S1P 3 receptors than control donor fibroblasts and exhibit an exaggerated pro-fibrotic response to TGF-β1 (421). Furthermore, S1P levels are elevated in sera of patients with SSc (214). As mentioned above, S1P gene signature is prominent in the inflammatory subset (390). Fingolimod (FTY720) has both agonist and antagonist effects in different S1P receptors and modulates lymphocyte trafficking, monocyte/macrophage biology, dendritic cell biology, and enhances Treg function at marginal zone B lymphocytes (144). When administered to chronic scleroderma graft-versus-host disease (cScl-GVHD) mice, FTY720 in either preventative or therapeutic protocols reduced fibrosis, expanded splenic myeloid suppressor cells, increased Tregs and B regulatory cells (Bregs), protected against vascular damage, reduced serum S1P and E-selectin levels, reduced numbers of inflammatory cells in skin, and reduced dermal expression of mRNA for TGF-β1, MCP-1, MIP-1α, RANTES, TNFα, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A (424).

Interestingly, CB1, CB2, and GPR55 have also been shown to modulate one another's activity via heteromerization, cross-antagonism, and other strategies (427,428). GPR18 (also known as "abnormal cannabinoid receptor"), another candidate cannabinoid receptor, may play a role in EC-mediated central blood pressure control and peripheral vascular tone (429,430). Unlike CB1, CB2, and GPR55; however, activation of this receptor requires FAAH-mediated metabolism of AEA or 2-AG to N-arachidonoyl-glycine (431). It is interesting to speculate that if there is reduced FAAH in tissue-expressing GPR18 in patients with SSc as has been found in SSc dermis, then this might contribute to vasoconstriction and hypertension (432). Substantial cross talk has also been established between the ECS and a network of nonselective action channels known as the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family, which serve to integrate mechanical and environmental stimuli with local autocrine signals to effect a variety of cell processes (433,434).Efforts to identify new cannabinoid receptors are ongoing; but CB1, CB2, and GPR55 are among the most extensively studied, and recent studies clearly demonstrate that all three of these receptors are activated by AEA and play a key role in transduction of EC signaling.

        <p>The general effect of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system is to act as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents. Although immune cells express more CB2 than CB1, both receptors and other non-CB receptors (such as PPARγ and GPR55) have been implicated in effecting immunomodulatory actions of cannabinoids (441,442). CB1 mRNA and protein expression in/on immune cells is responsive to cellular activation signals, i.e., cell type, cannabinoid ligand type, and immune stimulusdependent (443). Of relevance to SSc, IL-4 is specifically able via STAT5 pathway to induce CB1 mRNA in human T cells (444). Dendritic cells exposed to cannabinoids undergo NFκB-dependent apoptosis and reduce production of IL-12, which is important in priming Th0 cells to a Th1 orientation (445,446). Cannabinoids induce apoptosis of T cells via CB1 and CB2 engagement and effect a Th2 polarization (e.g., increased IL-4 by T cells) while decreasing Th1 polarization (e.g., decreased IL-12 by DC) but also suppress activation, differentiation, and expansion of T cells (443,447,448). B cells are affected by cannabinoids in several ways, including direct effects on activation, differentiation, and proliferation but also via effects on T cells that provide help to B cells (449). The effect of cannabinoids on B cells to suppress IgM and enhance IgE production apparently is mostly via engagement of CB2 (450). Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNFα, IFNγ, IL-2, and IL-1β) is suppressed in vitro and in vivo, by engaging CB2 by cannabinoids or other CB2 agonists (451)(452)(453). Of particular relevance to SSc is that mast cell activation is inhibited by 2-AG (454). The CB2 agonist, Gp1a, was found to suppress clinical disease in the EAE mouse model with a reduction in Th1 and Th17 cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. Analysis of the CD4 + cells in vivo in the periphery revealed Gp1a-treated mice had lower levels of expression of T but also RORγt (Th17 marker) and exhibited increased Foxp3 and GATA-3 expression (455). Under polarizing conditions in vitro, Gp1a suppressed Th1 and Th17 development of CD4 + T cells (455). The role of the ECS in innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in SSc is an area for further investigation, and these results with this CD2 agonist suggest similar agents might decrease autoimmunity and autoantibody production in SSc.The general effect of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system is to act as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents. Although immune cells express more CB2 than CB1, both receptors and other non-CB receptors (such as PPARγ and GPR55) have been implicated in effecting immunomodulatory actions of cannabinoids (441,442).

        <p>The upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelium of human coronary arteries by treatment with TNFα or LPS is inhibited by the CB2 agonist drug, JWH-133 (437). Engaging CB2 in rat coronary arteries by AEA induced the coronary arteries to dilate (456). Blocking CB1 on isolated human coronary smooth muscle cells by the CB1 antagonist, rimonabant, reduced ability of the smooth muscle cells to migrate and proliferate in response to PDGF (438). The ECs (AEA and virodhamine) were found to have a potent vasodilatory effect on preconstricted isolated human pulmonary artery rings that was endothelium-dependent and likely involved PGE 2 (436). The effect of AEA and virodhamine was CB1-and CB2-independent but involved a third receptor termed "endothelial cannabinoid receptor" (436). These studies suggest that a target for development of treatment for PAH in SSc might be based on virodhamine-like drugs that are agonist for the endothelial cannabinoid receptor.The upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelium of human coronary arteries by treatment with TNFα or LPS is inhibited by the CB2 agonist drug, JWH-133 (437).

        <p>Endocannabinoid Modulation of Fibrosis C57BL/6 mice with either TRPV1 receptor or calcitonin G-related peptide (CGRP) knocked out compared to WT mice developed enhanced dermal fibrosis after repeated subcutaneous injection of BLM (434). This suggests that TRPV1 receptor and CGRP have antifibrotic effects and may have relevance to patients with RP and SSc since skin biopsies from patients with SSc have reduced numbers of CGRP-immunoreactive C fibers and would likely have reduced vasodilatation from CGRP in response to stressors that trigger RP (434). It is unclear whether other TRPV1 receptor engagement or CGRP effects are operative to protect against fibrosis. TRPV4 has been implicated as a mechanosensor in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and has been shown to stimulate myofibroblast differentiation in rat cardiac fibroblasts via integration of mechanical and soluble (autocrine) signals, and pretreatment with the TRPV4 antagonist, AB159908, resulted in significant inhibition of TGF-β1-induced myofibroblasts differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (457). 5,6-EET (generated by activation of PAR-2 by mast cell tryptase or Factor Xa) has been implicated as the most likely autocrine mediator contributing to activation of TRPV4, though other autocrine signals may be involved as well, with the known TRPV4 agonist N-acyl taurine being another possible candidate. It is worth noting that this system of channels seems to be dysregulated in dcSSc fibroblasts with profound downregulation of TRPV2 (and possibly TRPV1) and overexpression of TRPV4.Endocannabinoid Modulation of Fibrosis C57BL/6 mice with either TRPV1 receptor or calcitonin G-related peptide (CGRP) knocked out compared to WT mice developed enhanced dermal fibrosis after repeated subcutaneous injection of BLM (434).

        <p>While the role of TRPV1 and TRPV2 is less clear, TRPV4 is known to stimulate myofibroblast differentiation in response to activation by mechanical stress and arachidonic acid derivatives. In normal wound repair, release of the myofibroblast from this mechanical stress signal plays a role in inducing apoptosis or, alternatively, may help drive the myofibroblast back into a quiescent fibroblast. Given that TRPV4 remains overexpressed in the dcSSc fibroblast, this may suggest that certain autocrine signals are present, which alter the cellular milieu in favor of constitutive activation of TRPV4, thus rendering the myofibroblast incapable of responding appropriately to mechanostress signaling. AEA and 2-AG activation of TRPV4 is indirect and requires hydrolysis of these compounds to free arachidonic acid, which is then converted into the potent TRPV4 agonist 5,6-EET. The fatty acid amide N-acyl-taurine was recently discovered to be a potent agonist of TRPV4, as well, and is likely overexpressed in SSc owing to underexpression of FAAH (432). This compound was shown to be elevated 10-fold following experimental inactivation of FAAH, with highest levels noted in the lungs and kidneys (458). Furthermore, inaction of FAAH in mice increases dermal fibrosis in response to subcutaneous administration of BLM (432). Serine proteases activate PARs, which have been associated with fibrosis of internal organs (459)(460)(461). PAR-1 is expressed by keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, while PAR-2 is expressed in suprabasal keratinocytes in SSc lesional skin and in healthy donor skin (462). There is more expression of PAR-1 by fibroblasts in biopsies of SSc lesional skin than by fibroblasts in biopsies of normal donor skin, and PAR-2 was expressed only by SSc lesional skin fibroblasts and not by normal donor fibroblasts (462). A large portion of fibroblasts in samples from SSc lesional skin were myofibroblasts, staining positive for αSMA suggesting that PAR-1 and PAR-2 may be involved in fibrosis development in SSc (462). PAR-1 is increased on SSc-associated ILD myofibroblasts, and when it is inhibited by the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, there is abrogation of formation of myofibroblasts, αSMA, and production of CI (463). Agonists of PAR-2 include mast cell tryptase and Factor Xa, and mast cells have been demonstrated to stimulate human lung fibroblast proliferation via activation of PAR-2.While the role of TRPV1 and TRPV2 is less clear, TRPV4 is known to stimulate myofibroblast differentiation in response to activation by mechanical stress and arachidonic acid derivatives.

        <p>It is worth noting the importance of COX-2 in the metabolism of ECs -specifically regarding 2-AG, which is more readily metabolized by COX-2 than AEA and has also been shown to activate PPARγ via a mechanism that is COX-2 dependent. Recent studies suggest the COX-2 metabolite of 2-AG, 15-deoxy-PGJ2-G, activates PPARγ (464) and that inhibition of IL-2 secretion by AEA in murine splenocytes is attenuated by COX-2 inhibition and also partially antagonized by PPARγ inhibition (465). Further work should be directed at evaluating PPARγ as a downstream target of the oxygenated metabolites of AEA and 2-AG, as this nuclear receptor is known to modulate fibrogenesis (likely by being a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β), autoimmunity, and a wide range of other physiologic processes (82,466). 2-AG is oxygenated by COX-2 and other PG synthases to produce several different glycerol-esters of the prostaglandins (PG-Gs). During the early stages of inflammation, in which microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES)-1 is high, one would expect to see higher levels of PGE 2 -G. Similarly, during resolution, in which PGD 2 and its spontaneous degradation products predominate, one would expect to see higher levels of PGD 2 -G and its metabolites. Interestingly, the EC analog of 2-AG, which is known as 15-deoxy-PGJ 2 -G, also has been shown to activate PPARγ and this cyclopentanone-EC derivative may be the mediator of 2-AG's activation of PPARγ. Further characterization of the P450-derived epoxides of AEA and 2-AG is needed, especially given the importance of P450, epoxygenase in PAR-2-mediated sustained activation of TRPV4, which may play a role in perpetuating fibroblast activation.It is worth noting the importance of COX-2 in the metabolism of ECs -specifically regarding 2-AG, which is more readily metabolized by COX-2 than AEA and has also been shown to activate PPARγ via a mechanism that is COX-2 dependent.

        <p>The efficacy of several cannabinoid agonists in attenuation of fibrosis has been demonstrated in both the BLM and hypochlorite murine models of SSc. Additionally, these compounds have been shown to counter several behavioral abnormalities of SSc fibroblasts, including reversal of myofibroblast differentiation and decreased resistance of SSc myofibroblasts to apoptosis, with the ultimate effect of decreased ECM deposition and attenuation of fibrogenesis. The exact mechanism by which these cannabinoid agonists exert their antifibrotic action is still a matter of debate, but it seems to be mediated in part by activation of CB2 and PPARγ. CB1 and CB2 are both overexpressed in dcSSc fibroblasts. Twenty-four hour incubation with the CB1/CB2 agonist, WIN55,212-2, resulted in agonist-induced inhibition of both CB receptors, which was reversible after agonist withdrawal (439). After 10 μM WIN55,212-2 incubation, a reduction in CI mRNA and protein was observed in both dcSSc and healthy fibroblasts (439). TGF-β and CTGF mRNA expression, as well as IL-6 levels were also substantially decreased after exposure to WIN55,212-2 (439). Analysis for αSMA by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry showed that WIN55,212-2 induced reduction in αSMA expression by 43% and increased by twofold the number of apoptotic fibroblasts from patients with dcSSc but not in fibroblasts from healthy donors (439). Pre-incubation of dcSSc and healthy fibroblasts with synthetic cannabinoid receptor antagonists AM281 (CB1 antagonist) and AM630 (CB2 antagonist) did not significantly reverse the effects of WIN55,212-2 on CI neosynthesis, inhibition of IL-6, or fibroblast apoptosis, indicating that the antifibrotic actions of WIN55,212-2 are mediated, in part, by pathways not involving CB1 and CB2, perhaps as the authors suggest by transducing pathways involving p-ERK (439). Incubation of dcSSc fibroblasts and healthy controls with WIN55,212-2 was noted to result in decreased phospho-ERK-1/2 protein expression in both groups (439). WIN55,212-2 was found to prevent BLM-induced dermal fibrosis in DBA/2J mice in vivo. Levels of phospho-Smad2/3 were analyzed and found to be significantly lower after WIN55,212-2 exposure. Subcutaneous inflammatory cell infiltration, dermal thickness, and CI content were comparable to the control group (440).
