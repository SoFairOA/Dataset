        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and social distancing led to changes to breastfeeding support available to women in the United Kingdom. Faceto-face professional support was reduced, and face-to-face peer support was cancelled. Anecdotal media accounts highlighted practices separating some mothers and babies in hospitals, alongside inaccurate stories of the safety of breastfeeding circulating. Meanwhile, new families were confined to their homes, separated from families and support networks. Given that we know breastfeeding is best supported by practices that keep mother and baby together, high-quality professional and peer-topeer support, and positive maternal well-being, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic upon the ability to breastfeed. To explore this, we conducted an online survey with 1219 breastfeeding mothers in the United Kingdom with a baby 0-12 months old to understand the impact of the pandemic upon breastfeeding duration, experiences and support. The results highlighted two very different experiences: 41.8% of mothers felt that breastfeeding was protected due to lockdown, but 27.0% of mothers struggled to get support and had numerous barriers stemming from lockdown with some stopped breastfeeding before they were ready. Mothers with a lower education, with more challenging living circumstances and from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to find the impact of lockdown challenging and stop breastfeeding. The findings are vital in understanding how we now support those women who may be grieving their loss of breastfeeding and are affected by their negative experiences and how we can learn from those with a positive experience to make sure all breastfeeding women are better supported if similar future events arise.The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and social distancing led to changes to breastfeeding support available to women in the United Kingdom.

        <p>Changes to breastfeeding support were part of this. We know that breastfeeding works best when women receive high-quality support (McFadden et al., 2017), including promotion immediately post birth of skin-to-skin contact, mother and baby remaining together and support to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth (Gavine, McFadden, MacGillivray, &amp; Renfrew, 2017). Thereafter, receiving continued support in the community is particularly important to breastfeeding success (Pérez-Escamilla, Martinez, &amp; Segura-Pérez, 2016).Changes to breastfeeding support were part of this.

        <p>However, many of these aspects of gold standard care have been affected by the pandemic. As a novel pathogen, no data were initially available on whether SARS-CoV-2 could be vertically transmitted from mother to infant in utero or postnatally, through direct respiratory inhalation or breastfeeding (Juan et al., 2020). These concerns led to anecdotal reports in the local and international news and on globally shared social media posts of mothers giving birth without partner or doula support, being separated from their infant after birth or being told that breastfeeding was not safe (Guardian, 2020;Pramono, Dahlen, Desborough, &amp; Smith, 2020). This was despite action in the United Kingdom from breastfeeding and public health organisations to emphasise the safety and importance of continued breastfeeding (UNICEF UK, 2020).However, many of these aspects of gold standard care have been affected by the pandemic.

        <p>Meanwhile, in the community, many health visitors were redeployed into nursing roles, face-to-face breastfeeding support groups were moved online or abandoned and antenatal care was delivered largely online. More broadly, there was much fear in communities around infection spread, and social distancing requirements removed family support and contact for many new parents.Meanwhile, in the community, many health visitors were redeployed into nursing roles, face-to-face breastfeeding support groups were moved online or abandoned and antenatal care was delivered largely online.

        <p>At the time of writing, no published peer-reviewed data exists on the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding outcomes and decisions around infant feeding in the United Kingdom. This mixed-methods online survey study examined the experiences of over 1200 women with infants under the age of 1 year to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their infant feeding attitudes, choices and outcomes. A greater understanding of these impacts will guide practice and policy with regards to supporting pregnant and new mothers.At the time of writing, no published peer-reviewed data exists on the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding outcomes and decisions around infant feeding in the United Kingdom.

Most breastfeeding complications, need for greater support and decisions to stop prematurely happen in the earlier months of feeding, although it is recognised that breastfeeding continues for longer.

        <p>Another common experience was that the additional time and lack of pressure meant that it was easier to feed responsively, that is, responding to infant cues of hunger and satiety rather than following a mother led routine (WHO, 2003). Mothers reported feeding babies more often, to less of a routine because they did not need to plan around things like school runs and spotting earlier feeding cues. This impacted positively on perceptions of milk supply and played out in increased early weight gain.Another common experience was that the additional time and lack of pressure meant that it was easier to feed responsively, that is, responding to infant cues of hunger and satiety rather than following a mother led routine (WHO, 2003).

        <p>To bring these findings together, it is clear that many breastfeeding mothers in the United Kingdom have had a very divided experience when it comes to feeding their baby during the pandemic.To bring these findings together, it is clear that many breastfeeding mothers in the United Kingdom have had a very divided experience when it comes to feeding their baby during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>This study explored women's experiences of breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to how lockdown measures affected their infant feeding decisions. It clearly showed two very different experiences emerging, one where women felt more able to establish and maintain breastfeeding and one where women felt lockdown created and exacerbated issues. Somewhat unsurprisingly, those who stopped breastfeeding during lockdown had a more difficult experience, with many blaming it for having to stop breastfeeding before they were ready. Overall, the findings have important considerations for those working in breastfeeding support and policy and should be used to reflect on provision in any future similar situations (Renfrew, Cheyne, Dykes, et al., 2020).This study explored women's experiences of breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to how lockdown measures affected their infant feeding decisions.

        <p>Taking the issue of misinformation first, women receiving incorrect information about the safety of COVID-19 and breastfeeding, being told they cannot breastfeed their baby if they had symptoms, or being separated from them after birth is a major concern. At the start of the pandemic, mothers and babies were routinely separated in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and more, with breast milk substitutes sometimes recommended (Tomori, Gribble, Palmquist, Ververs, &amp; Gross, 2020). Likewise, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended separating mother and baby in case of suspected infection (Bartick, 2020)-guidance that has now thankfully changed (AAP, 2020). Although a number of organisations in the United Kingdom were quick to state that breastfeeding was safe and to be encouraged (UNICEF UK, 2020), professionals and parents alike may still have been exposed to these messages. This was not helped by the spread of misinformation on social media, something that was rife across different impacts upon health during the pandemic (Singh et al., 2020). If a lockdown occurs again, it is vital that policy makers ensure rapid, clear and visible support for continued breastfeeding both across health care professionals and social media messaging.Taking the issue of misinformation first, women receiving incorrect information about the safety of COVID-19 and breastfeeding, being told they cannot breastfeed their baby if they had symptoms, or being separated from them after birth is a major concern.

        <p>Separation of mother and baby goes against everything we know about supporting breastfeeding initiation (Pérez-Escamilla et al., 2016;Renfrew, Cheyne, Craig, et al., 2020) and promoting stable newborn behaviour (Ahn, Ko, Kim, Lee, &amp; Shin, 2008). Although the overall percentage of women being told breastfeeding was not safe or being prevented from being with their newborn baby was low in our study, it led to breastfeeding cessation or fears around safety, even amongst some mothers of older infants where breastfeeding was established.Separation of mother and baby goes against everything we know about supporting breastfeeding initiation (Pérez-Escamilla et al., 2016;Renfrew, Cheyne, Craig, et al., 2020) and promoting stable newborn behaviour (Ahn, Ko, Kim, Lee, &amp; Shin, 2008).

        <p>Over four in five women prevented from visiting their baby in the NICU had stopped breastfeeding by the time they completed this study. That statistic is unsurprising; it has long been recognised that keeping mother and baby together particularly when her baby is premature and in the NICU plays a vital in breastfeeding success (Cuttini et al., 2019;Renfrew et al., 2010). Meanwhile, new mothers can already be anxious about the safety of their breast milk (Kronborg, Harder, &amp; Hall, 2015) even before they receive such messages from trusted health professionals.Over four in five women prevented from visiting their baby in the NICU had stopped breastfeeding by the time they completed this study.

        <p>It is likely that some health professionals or hospitals will have been erring on the side of caution, particularly at the start of an epidemic. If a baby had become critically ill or died because of COVID-19 infection transferred from a mother when it was preventable, the consequences would be severe. This was not helped by confusion amongst different sources of health information; misinformation and fear may have spread before this stage. We also know that not all health professionals are supportive of breastfeeding or believe that if any perceived risk presents itself, it should not be encouraged (Watkins &amp; Dodgson, 2010).It is likely that some health professionals or hospitals will have been erring on the side of caution, particularly at the start of an epidemic.

        <p>However, we now know that mother to infant transmission during pregnancy or after the birth appears uncommon, with infants having low rates of infection and reduced risk of severe disease and complications (Walker et al., 2020). Overwhelmingly, reports on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk samples have been negative (Smith et al., 2020). One case study from Australia found that when a symptomatic mother took suitable precautions (e.g., mask wearing and handwashing), her infant did not contract the illness (Lowe &amp; Bopp, 2020), and these precautions are emphasised by WHO (2020b).However, we now know that mother to infant transmission during pregnancy or after the birth appears uncommon, with infants having low rates of infection and reduced risk of severe disease and complications (Walker et al., 2020).

        <p>Although a small number of case reports identified low numbers of viral fragments in samples of human milk from symptomatic mothers (Groß et al., 2020), a systematic review by the WHO highlighted that no report had demonstrated the presence of intact viral particles, and viral infectivity cell culture assays had not yet been performed (WHO, 2020b). We also know that from looking at similar outbreaks such as the 2003 SARS-CoV virus, there was no evidence of transmission into breast milk (CDC, 2020).Although a small number of case reports identified low numbers of viral fragments in samples of human milk from symptomatic mothers (Groß et al., 2020), a systematic review by the WHO highlighted that no report had demonstrated the presence of intact viral particles, and viral infectivity cell culture assays had not yet been performed (WHO, 2020b).

        <p>Conversely, we know that breast milk passes immune protection to the infant if a mother comes into contact with an infection (Goldman, 1993). We also know that in the previous SARS-CoV epidemic, women who were infected were found to produce antibodies in their milk (Robertson et al., 2004) Tackett, 2007) and psychologically (Brown, 2019). When mothers meet their own breastfeeding goals, their mental health is protected, but when they cannot, particularly if they experience complications, their risk of depression, grief and trauma increases. When weighing up the potential risks of breastfeeding, the whole picture must be taken into consideration.Conversely, we know that breast milk passes immune protection to the infant if a mother comes into contact with an infection (Goldman, 1993).

        <p>This takes us to the issue of the number of women stopping breastfeeding during the lockdown, many of whom did not access support and felt that changes to support directly impacted their decision to stop breastfeeding. Mothers who gave birth during the pandemic, as against before it, were more likely to have stopped breastfeeding at the time of the survey. This will likely be confounded by these mothers having a younger infant and therefore being more likely to encounter breastfeeding difficulties and consequently being at greater risk of stopping breastfeeding (McAndrew et al., 2012), although when mothers of older infants did encounter difficulties, they too felt they were affected by a lack of face-to-face support.This takes us to the issue of the number of women stopping breastfeeding during the lockdown, many of whom did not access support and felt that changes to support directly impacted their decision to stop breastfeeding.

        <p>However, mothers who gave birth in lockdown reported feeling more negatively affected by the pandemic and lockdown both in terms of feeling they did not get enough support and that limitations on social contact prevented them from accessing support services and social opportunities. It is likely that mothers of an older infant may either not rely on such opportunities so heavily, or have already made connections, and raises critical points for the importance of focussed support in the early weeks of breastfeeding.However, mothers who gave birth in lockdown reported feeling more negatively affected by the pandemic and lockdown both in terms of feeling they did not get enough support and that limitations on social contact prevented them from accessing support services and social opportunities.

        <p>We know that professional and peer support plays a vital role in breastfeeding success (Ingram et al., 2020;McFadden et al., 2017;Thomson, Crossland, &amp; Dykes, 2012;Trickey et al., 2018), but when exploring qualitative responses, it was clear that women who stopped breastfeeding were affected by a lack of practical, emotional and peer support. Women, particularly in the early weeks of breastfeeding where care needs are highest, were affected by not being able to see health professionals face to face or when appointments did occur feeling uncomfortable. Services such as tongue-tie division were unavailable through usual NHS routes, and few women appeared to know about private options. Many of these women directly blamed the pandemic and lockdown on being unable to continue. Very few felt ready to do so, and most had planned to breastfeed for longer-an experience we know is related to increased risk of postnatal depression (Brown, Rance, &amp; Bennett, 2016).We know that professional and peer support plays a vital role in breastfeeding success (Ingram et al., 2020;McFadden et al., 2017;Thomson, Crossland, &amp; Dykes, 2012;Trickey et al., 2018), but when exploring qualitative responses, it was clear that women who stopped breastfeeding were affected by a lack of practical, emotional and peer support.

        <p>It has also been recognised that the pandemic has had an impact on morbidity and mortality rates outside of COVID-19 infection, for example, through delayed access to services, cancellations and avoiding hospitals (ONS, 2020). It is important that policy makers now track the impact upon population breastfeeding duration and subsequent physical and mental health outcomes. As noted previously, not breastfeeding has long-term health consequences at the population level for both women and children, the impact of which may not be seen for some time. What is more imminent is the need for support for women who have not been able to meet their breastfeeding goals or who have struggled through this period in pain because of a lack of support (Brown, 2018). Evidence is also emerging that rates of perinatal depression increased during COVID-19 lockdowns in China (Wu et al., 2020) and Canada (Davenport, Meyer, Meah, Strynadka, &amp; Khurana, 2020). This is unsurprising; we know that social isolation, lack of professional support, health worries and financial difficultiesof which COVID-19 created the perfect storm-increase the risk of perinatal depression (Redshaw &amp; Henderson, 2013). Policy makers must ensure families receive the holistic support they need from now on (Institute of Health Visiting, 2020).It has also been recognised that the pandemic has had an impact on morbidity and mortality rates outside of COVID-19 infection, for example, through delayed access to services, cancellations and avoiding hospitals (ONS, 2020).

        <p>Finally, it is clear that women's experiences of COVID-19 and breastfeeding differ significantly according to their experience of the pandemic and lockdown. From a positive perspective, 41.8% of mothers actually reported that the pandemic had a positive impact on their infant feeding experiences. It appeared that it forced or encouraged some mothers into situations where they were able to do a lot of things that we know support breastfeeding well: increased time to get breastfeeding established, fewer interruptions, more time with supportive partners and protection from unwanted opinions (Brown, 2016). Effectively, these women's experiences emulate that seen in many cultures where postnatal recovery and care are prioritised through rest, food and care (Dennis et al., 2007).Finally, it is clear that women's experiences of COVID-19 and breastfeeding differ significantly according to their experience of the pandemic and lockdown.

        <p>What is clear from the findings, however, is that mothers who found the experience more positive were more privileged in their living circumstances. They had more space in their homes, access to gardens and green space for exercise, fast Wi-Fi connections and fewer financial difficulties. Breastfeeding and, more broadly, caring for their infant were supported by the environment in which they lived.What is clear from the findings, however, is that mothers who found the experience more positive were more privileged in their living circumstances.

        <p>Although stress itself does not impact milk production, it can inhibit the milk ejection reflex, making breastfeeding more difficult (Dewey, 2001). It is likely that those living without these advantages may find breastfeeding a very different experience. Reflecting back on known influences on postnatal depression such as isolation, money worries and stress, it is likely women in these experiences find caring for a baby more difficult, and breastfeeding is a large part of that caring experience. This is before we consider the increased occurrence of domestic violence and relationship difficulties during lockdown (Usher, Bhullar, Durkin, Gyamfi, &amp; Jackson, 2020).Although stress itself does not impact milk production, it can inhibit the milk ejection reflex, making breastfeeding more difficult (Dewey, 2001).

        <p>The concern that arises is the divide in breastfeeding experience that the pandemic has created or more accurately widened. We know that mothers with a lower education (e.g., school leavers ≤ 18 years) and income level are more likely to stop breastfeeding in the early weeks, experiencing more difficulties and less support (Brown, Raynor, &amp; Lee, 2011;McAndrew et al., 2012). In our study, mothers without a university-level education had fewer advantages in their living circumstances and reported a more negative impact of lockdown upon their breastfeeding experience. However, living circumstances impacted mothers independently of education level, suggesting a direct impact of more disadvantaged circumstances.The concern that arises is the divide in breastfeeding experience that the pandemic has created or more accurately widened.

        <p>Notably, mothers from BAME populations were also more likely to have stopped breastfeeding and have found the lockdown experience more negative. Given data that BAME mothers in the United Kingdom typically initiate and continue breastfeeding at a higher rate than White women (McAndrew et al., 2012), this is especially concerning. Although women from BAME backgrounds perceived they had less practical support during the lockdown and were more likely to attribute breastfeeding cessation to a lack of professional support, there were no other differences in feeding experiences (e.g., reactions to lockdown), suggesting further external factors may be at play. Evidence is mounting that racial disparities in access to care and increasing racism in response to the pandemic are putting BAME communities at increased risk of negative outcomes from the pandemic (Coates, 2020;Lacobucci, 2020).

        <p>The question arises as to how we can make a difference moving forward. It is unlikely that face-to-face breastfeeding support will return to prepandemic levels in the near future, with some families needing to shield for longer. Online and telephone support is likely to remain as a core support mechanism for some time. It is critical that we ensure positive and accurate messaging and support services reach all mothers and that we overcome the barriers some are facing.The question arises as to how we can make a difference moving forward.

        <p>Limitations aside, the findings are important in highlighting the impact of the pandemic upon infant feeding experiences in the United Kingdom. Although larger population-scale data are needed, our findings suggest that the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown upon breastfeeding rates may be very mixed. Whereas some mothers have been enabled to breastfeed for longer, others have felt forced to stop before they are ready. What the overall impact of this upon national breastfeeding rates will be is yet to be seen.Limitations aside, the findings are important in highlighting the impact of the pandemic upon infant feeding experiences in the United Kingdom.
