        <p>The first direct search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the recently discovered Higgs boson (H) is described. The search is performed in the H → μτ e and H → μτ h channels, where τ e and τ h are tau leptons reconstructed in the electronic and hadronic decay channels, respectively.

The sensitivity of the search is an order of magnitude better than the existing indirect limits. A slight excess of signal events with a significance of 2.4 standard deviations is observed.

        <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3] has generated great interest in exploring its properties. In the standard model (SM), lepton-flavour-violating (LFV) decays are forbidden if the theory is to be renormalizable [4]. If this requirement is relaxed, so the theory is valid only to a finite mass scale, then LFV couplings may be introduced. LFV decays can occur naturally in models with more than one Higgs doublet without abandoning renormalizability [5]. They also arise in supersymmetric models [6][7][8][9], composite Higgs boson models [10,11], models with flavour symmetries [12], Randall-Sundrum models [13][14][15], and many others [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. The presence of LFV couplings would allow μ → e, τ → μ and τ → e transitions to proceed via a virtual Higgs boson [24,25]. The experimental limits on these have recently been translated into constraints on the branching fractions B(H → eμ, μτ , eτ ) [4,26]. The μ → e transition is strongly constrained by null search results for μ → eγ [27], B(H → μe) &lt; O (10 -8 ). However, the constraints on τ → μ and τ → e are much less stringent. These come from searches for τ → μγ [28,29] and other rare τ decays [30], τ → eγ , μ and eg -2 measurements [27]. Exclusion limits on the electron and muon electric dipole moments [31] also provide complementary constraints. These lead to the much less restrictive limits: B(H → μτ ) &lt; O(10%), B(H → eτ ) &lt; O(10%). The observation of the Higgs boson offers the possibility of sensitive direct E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. searches for LFV Higgs boson decays. To date no dedicated searches have been performed. However, a theoretical reinterpretation of the ATLAS H → τ τ search results in terms of LFV decays by an independent group has been used to set limits at the 95% confidence level (CL) of B(H → μτ ) &lt; 13%, B(H → eτ ) &lt; 13% [4]. This letter describes a search for a LFV decay of a Higgs boson with M H = 125 GeV at the CMS experiment. The 2012 dataset collected at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb -1 is used. The search is performed in two channels, H → μτ e and H → μτ h , where τ e and τ h are tau leptons reconstructed in the electronic and hadronic decay channels, respectively. The signature is very similar to the SM H → τ μ τ e and H → τ μ τ h decays, where τ μ is a tau lepton decaying muonically, which have been studied by CMS in Refs. [32,33] and ATLAS in Ref. [34], but with some significant kinematic differences. The μ comes promptly from the LFV H decay and tends to have a larger momentum than in the SM case. There is only one tau lepton so there are typically fewer neutrinos in the decay.

        <p>The two channels are divided into categories based on the number of jets in order to separate the different H boson production mechanisms. The signal sensitivity is enhanced by using different selection criteria for each category. The dominant production mechanism is gluon-gluon fusion but there is also a significant contribution from vector boson fusion which is enhanced by requiring jets to be present in the event. The dominant background in the H → μτ e channel is Z → τ τ . Other much smaller backgrounds come from misidentified leptons in W + jets, QCD multijets and tt events. In the H → μτ h channel the dominant background arises from misidentified τ leptons in W + jets, QCD multijets and tt events. Less significant backgrounds come from Z → τ τ and Z + jets. The principal backgrounds are estimated using data. There is also a small background from SM H decays which is estimated with simulation. The presence or absence of a signal is established by fitting a mass distribution for signal and background using the asymptotic CL s criterion [35,36]. A "blind" analysis was performed. The data in the signal region were not studied until the selection criteria had been fixed and the background estimate finalized.The two channels are divided into categories based on the number of jets in order to separate the different H boson production mechanisms.

        <p>A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a description of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [37]. The momenta of charged particles are measured with a silicon pixel and strip tracker that covers the pseudorapidity range |η| &lt; 2.5 and is inside a 3.8 T axial magnetic field. Surrounding the tracker are a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter, both consisting of a barrel assembly and two endcaps that extend to a pseudorapidity range of |η| &lt; 3.0. A steel/quartzfiber Cherenkov forward detector extends the calorimetric coverage to |η| &lt; 5.0. The outermost component of the CMS detector is the muon system, consisting of gas-ionization detectors placed in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet to measure the momenta of muons traversing the detector. The two-level CMS trigger system selects events of interest for permanent storage. The first trigger level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events in less than 3.2 μs. The high-level trigger software algorithms, executed on a farm of commercial processors, further reduce the event rate using information from all detector subsystems.A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a description of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref.

        <p>Simulated samples of signal and background events are produced using various Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, with the CMS detector response modeled with Geant4 [38]. Higgs bosons are produced in proton-proton collisions predominantly by gluongluon fusion, but also by vector boson fusion and in association with a W or Z boson. It is assumed that the rate of new decays of the H are sufficiently small that the narrow width approximation can be used. The LFV H decay samples are produced with pythia 8.
            <rs type="version">175</rs> [39]. The background event samples with a SM H are generated by powheg 1.0 [40][41][42][43][44] with the τ decays modeled by tauola [45]. The MadGraph 5.1 [46] generator is used for Z + jets, W + jets, tt, and diboson production, and powheg for single top-quark production. The powheg and MadGraph generators are interfaced with pythia for parton shower and fragmentation.

        <p>The large number of proton interactions occurring per LHC bunch crossing (pileup), with an average of 21 in 2012, makes the identification of the vertex corresponding to the hard-scattering process nontrivial. This affects most of the object reconstruction algorithms: jets, lepton isolation, etc. The tracking system is able to separate collision vertices as close as 0.5 mm along the beam direction [49]. For each vertex, the sum of the p 2 T of all tracks associated with the vertex is computed. The vertex for which this quantity is the largest is assumed to correspond to the hardscattering process, and is referred to as the primary vertex in the event reconstruction.The large number of proton interactions occurring per LHC bunch crossing (pileup), with an average of 21 in 2012, makes the identification of the vertex corresponding to the hard-scattering process nontrivial.

        <p>The systematic uncertainties that lead to a change in the shape of the M col distribution are summarized in Table 5. In the embedded Z → τ τ M col distribution, used to estimate the Z → τ τ background, a 1% shift has been observed with respect to Z → τ τ simulations by comparing the means of both distributions. This occurs only in the H → μτ e channel. The M col distribution has been corrected for this effect and a 100% uncertainty on this shift is used as a systematic uncertainty for the possible bias. The jet energy scale has been studied extensively and a standard prescription for corrections [65] is used in all CMS analyses. The overall scale is set using γ + jets events and the most significant uncertainty arises from the photon energy scale. A number of other uncertainties such as jet fragmentation modeling, single pion response and uncertainties in the pileup corrections are also included. The jet energy scale uncertainties (3-7%) are applied as a function of p T and η, including all correlations, to all jets in the event, propagated to the missing energy, and the resultant M col distribution is used in the fit. There is also an additional uncertainty to account for the unclustered energy scale uncertainty. The unclustered energy comes from jets below 10 GeV and PF candidates not within jets. It is also propagated to the missing transverse energy. These effects cause a shift of the M col distribution.
