        <p>We present the first joint analysis of gamma-ray data from the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes and the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to search for gamma-ray signals from dark matter annihilation in dwarf satellite galaxies. We combine 158 hours of Segue 1 observations with MAGIC with 6-year observations of 15 dwarf satellite galaxies by the Fermi-LAT. We obtain limits on the annihilation cross-section for dark matter particle masses between 10 GeV and 100 TeV -the widest mass range ever explored by a single gamma-ray analysis. These limits improve on previously published Fermi -LAT and MAGIC results by up to a factor of two at certain masses. Our new inclusive analysis approach is completely generic and can be used to perform a global, sensitivity-optimized dark matter search by combining data from present and future gamma-ray and neutrino detectors.We present the first joint analysis of gamma-ray data from the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes and the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to search for gamma-ray signals from dark matter annihilation in dwarf satellite galaxies.

        <p>The existence of a non-baryonic, neutral and cold dark matter (DM) component in the Universe is supported by an overwhelming body of observational evidence, mainly involving its gravitational effects on the dynamics of cosmic structures like galaxy clusters (first observed by Zwicky in 1933 [1]) and spiral galaxies [2,3], and on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background [4,5]. Several theories beyond the Standard Model postulate the existence of a new neutral, stable and weakly interacting massive particle (generically known as WIMP [6]), with mass in the TeV scale, and that could account for the measured DM relic density (e.g. [7]).The existence of a non-baryonic, neutral and cold dark matter (DM) component in the Universe is supported by an overwhelming body of observational evidence, mainly involving its gravitational effects on the dynamics of cosmic structures like galaxy clusters (first observed by Zwicky in 1933 [1]) and spiral galaxies [2,3], and on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background [4,5].

        <p>A promising way to identify the nature of DM and to measure its properties is to search for the Standard Model (SM) particles produced through WIMP annihilation or decay at DM over-densities, or halos, in the local Universe. Among those SM products, gamma rays and neutrinos are the only stable neutral particles. They travel from their production sites to Earth unaffected by magnetic deflection, and as such are ideal messengers for astronomical DM searches.A promising way to identify the nature of DM and to measure its properties is to search for the Standard Model (SM) particles produced through WIMP annihilation or decay at DM over-densities, or halos, in the local Universe.

        <p>A natural step forward within this collective effort is the combination of data from different experiments and/or observational targets, which allows a global and sensitivityoptimized search [38]. This can be achieved in a relatively straightforward way since, for a given DM particle model, a joint likelihood function can be written as the product of the particular likelihood functions for each of the measurements/instruments. One advantage of such an approach is that the details of each experiment, such as event lists or instrument response functions (IRFs), do not need to be combined or averaged.A natural step forward within this collective effort is the combination of data from different experiments and/or observational targets, which allows a global and sensitivityoptimized search [38].

        <p>DSphs are associated with the population of Galactic DM sub-halos, predicted by the cold DM structure formation scenario and reproduced in N-body cosmological simulations (e.g. [39,40]), that have accreted enough baryonic mass to form stars (other sub-halos may remain completely dark). DSphs have very high mass-to-light ratios, being the most DM-dominated systems known so far [41]. They have the advantage of being free of other sources of gamma-ray emission and have been identified predominantly at high Galactic latitudes, where diffuse astrophysical foregrounds from the Milky Way are lowest. Because they are relatively close, they are expected to appear as point-like or marginally extended sources for gamma-ray and neutrino telescopes, with relatively high DM annihilation fluxes. The stellar kinematics of these systems can be used to determine their DM distribution and its uncertainty using a common methodology [42][43][44]. These measurements enable the combination of dSph observations that constrains models of DM annihilation or decay within the dSph population as a whole.DSphs are associated with the population of Galactic DM sub-halos, predicted by the cold DM structure formation scenario and reproduced in N-body cosmological simulations (e.g. [39,40]), that have accreted enough baryonic mass to form stars (other sub-halos may remain completely dark).

        <p>The Florian Goebel Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes are located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (28.8 • N, 17.9 • W; 2200 m above sea level), on the Canary Island of La Palma, Spain. MAGIC is a system of two telescopes that detect Cherenkov light produced by the atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic particles entering the Earth's atmosphere. Images of these showers are projected by the MAGIC reflectors onto the photo-multiplier tube (PMT) cameras, and are used to reconstruct the calorimetric and spatial properties, as well as the nature of the primary particle. Thanks to its large reflectors (17 meter diameter), plus its high-quantum-efficiency and low-noise PMTs, MAGIC achieves high sensitivity to Cherenkov light and low energy threshold [45]. The MAGIC telescopes are able to detect cosmic gamma rays in the very high energy (VHE) domain, i.e. in the range between ∼50 GeV and ∼50 TeV.The Florian Goebel Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes are located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (28.8 • N, 17.9 • W; 2200 m above sea level), on the Canary Island of La Palma, Spain.

        <p>For this work we use MAGIC data corresponding to 158 hours of observations of the satellite galaxy Segue 1 [32], the deepest observations of any dSph by a Cherenkov telescope to date. 9 The data were taken between 2011 and 2013, with observations before, during, and after a major hardware upgrade [46]. This resulted in the necessity of defining 4 different observation periods, each described by a different set of IRFs. Observations were performed in the so-called wobble mode, which allows simultaneous observations of the target and the background control regions. For that purpose, two different positions ∼0.4 • away from the position of Segue 1 were tracked alternatively for 20 min runs. For each of these positions, the spectral shape of the residual background is slightly different, and needs to be modeled independently. Therefore, for MAGIC, we consider 8 independent data sets, each consisting of the gamma-ray candidate events plus the corresponding IRFs and residual background models. The MAGIC data are analyzed with a one-dimensional unbinned likelihood fit to the energy distribution within a signal (or ON) region of radius 0.122 • around the center of Segue 1 (optimized for a source with the angular size of Segue 1). The integral of the DM emission template within the ON region defines the model for the expected signal distribution as a function of energy. See Section 3.2 and Ref. [32] for more details about the MAGIC data analysis.For this work we use MAGIC data corresponding to 158 hours of observations of the satellite galaxy Segue 1 [32], the deepest observations of any dSph by a Cherenkov telescope to date. 9 The data were taken between 2011 and 2013, with observations before, during, and after a major hardware upgrade [46].

        <p>The Fermi -LAT is a pair-conversion telescope that is sensitive to gamma rays in the energy range from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV [47]. With its large field-of-view (2.4 sr), the LAT is able to efficiently survey the entire sky. Since its launch in June 2008, the LAT has primarily operated in a survey observation mode that continuously scans the entire sky every 3 hours. The survey-mode exposure coverage is fairly uniform with variations of at most 30% with respect to the average exposure. The LAT point-source sensitivity, which is dependent on the intensity of diffuse backgrounds, shows larger variations but is relatively constant at high Galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 10 • ). More details on the on-orbit performance of the LAT are provided in Ref. [48].The Fermi -LAT is a pair-conversion telescope that is sensitive to gamma rays in the energy range from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV [47].

        <p>The Fermi -LAT data set used in this work corresponds to 6 years of observations of 15 dSphs. We analyzed the data with the latest (Pass 8) event-level analysis [34], using the

            <rs type="software">P8R2 SOURCE</rs> V
            <rs type="version">6</rs> IRFs. DM signal morphological and spectral templates are used in a three-dimensional likelihood fit to the distribution of events in reconstructed energy and direction within the 10 • × 10 • dSph region-of-interest (ROI). The model for each ROI contains the dSph DM intensity template, templates for Galactic and isotropic diffuse backgrounds, and point sources taken from the third LAT source catalog (3FGL) [49] within 15 • of the ROI center. A broadband fit in each ROI is performed fitting the normalizations of the Galactic and isotropic diffuse components and 3FGL sources that fall within the ROI boundary. After performing the broadband fit, a set of likelihoods is extracted for each energy bin by scanning the flux normalization of a putative DM source modeled as a power law with spectral index 2 at the location of the dSph. Tables with likelihood values versus energy flux for each energy bin are produced for all considered targets. The likelihood tables used for the present work are taken from Ref. [34] and can be found in the corresponding online material. 10 These tables allow the computation of jointlikelihood values for any gamma-ray spectrum, and are used as input to the present analysis (see Section 3.2 for more details).

        <p>We compute one-sided, 95% confidence level upper limits to σv by numerically solving the equation -2 ln λ P ( σv 2.71 | D) = 2.71, with σv restricted to the physical (≥0) region. This prescription is the one used by the Fermi -LAT Collaboration in Refs. [33,34], and differs slightly from the one used by MAGIC in Ref. [32]. This has consequences on the comparison of the results presented here with previous MAGIC results, which will be discussed below. The effect of the statistical uncertainty on the J-factor is also illustrated by showing curves where J is treated as either a nuisance or fixed parameter. In each case, the 95% confidence level upper limits are obtained from the crossing point between the corresponding curve and the -2 ln(λ P ) = 2.71 line.

We also show the observed limits obtained with MAGIC and Fermi -LAT data considered individually. The combined limits are compared to the median, and the 68% and 95% containment bands, expected under the null (H 0 : σv = 0) hypothesis.

MAGIC fast simulations consist of a set of event energies randomly generated according to the background PDF, h (see Section 3.2 and Ref. [32] for details), for both ON and OFF regions.

        <p>Systematic uncertainties in the determination of the J-factors would weaken the limits on σv that can be inferred from the MAGIC and Fermi -LAT observations. In this work we take the J-factors and associated uncertainties from Ref. [42], which are largely consistent with the independent analysis of Ref. [43]. The analysis presented in Ref. [44], using a more flexible parameterization for the stellar velocity distributions and more stringent criteria for stellar membership, produces substantially larger J-factor uncertainties for the ultrafaint dSphs used in the present study (0.4-2.0 dex versus 0.2-0.3 dex). They find the J-factor of Segue 1 to be particularly uncertain due to the ambiguous membership status of a few stars, and when excluding stars with membership probability less than 95% they find log 10 (J obs /(GeV 2 cm -5 )) =17.0 +2.1 -2.2 . This value is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the J-factor used in the present analysis (log 10 (J obs /(GeV 2 cm -5 )) =19.5±0.3) and would imply substantially weaker limits from the MAGIC observations of Segue 1. Although a full examination of the J-factor uncertainties is beyond the scope of the present work, we note that these uncertainties do not diminish the power of the joint likelihood approach and can be fully accounted for in our analysis procedure by updating the uncertainty parameter in the J-factor likelihood (Equation 3.6).Systematic uncertainties in the determination of the J-factors would weaken the limits on σv that can be inferred from the MAGIC and Fermi -LAT observations.

        <p>This work presents, for the first time, limits on the DM annihilation cross-section from a comprehensive analysis of gamma-ray data with energies between 500 MeV and 10 TeV. Using a common analysis approach (both in the applied statistical methods and in the determination of the J-factors) we have combined the MAGIC observations of Segue 1 with Fermi-LAT observations of 15 dSphs. This allowed the computation of meaningful global DM limits, and the direct comparison of the individual results obtained with the different instruments. Our results span the DM particle mass range from 10 GeV to 100 TeV -the widest range covered by a single gamma-ray analysis to date.This work presents, for the first time, limits on the DM annihilation cross-section from a comprehensive analysis of gamma-ray data with energies between 500 MeV and 10 TeV.

The obtained results are the most constraining bounds in the considered mass range, from observations of dSphs.

In the intermediate mass range (from few hundred GeV to few tens TeV, depending on the considered annihilation channel), where Fermi -LAT and MAGIC achieve comparable sensitivities, the improvement of the combined result with respect to the individual ones reaches a factor ∼2.

The difference between old and new prescriptions in MAGIC individual limits goes, depending on the annihilation channel and DM particle mass, from none (when σv ≥ 0) up to a factor ∼4 (for ∼2σ background fluctuations, see Figures 2 and3).The latter approach cannot be applied to Fermi -LAT analysis since, due to low bin statistics, the likelihood function can be undefined for negative σv values (see Equation 4 in Ref.
