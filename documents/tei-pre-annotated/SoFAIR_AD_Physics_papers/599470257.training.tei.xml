        <p>Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization challenge in catalysis. Here we show how the catalytic properties of subnanometric Pt clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite modulate upon introduction of partially reduced Sn species that interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface. The low mobility of Sn in H2 over an extended period of time (&gt;6 h) even at high temperatures (e.g. 600 ⁰C), which is determined by only a few additional Sn atoms added to the Pt clusters. Such structural features, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques and can be laid out after combination of in situ EXAFS, HAADF-STEM and CO-IR data, is key to provide one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.</p>
        <p>It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulated metal catalysts can significantly modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behavior 1 . Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of the bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the way of preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthesis treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity [2][3][4] . Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which can result in further changes of the catalytic behavior with time on stream.</p>
        <p>Pt-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis in numerous industrial processes, due to their excellent properties for the activation of C-H bonds, while limiting the extend of C-C bond cleavage via hydrogenolysis 5 . Nonetheless, a second metal is typically incorporated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or stability, particularly when the reaction temperature needs to be high (e.g. endothermic reactions). For instance, Sn is introduced as a second metal for propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the UOP Oleflex TM process 6,7 . Pt and the second metal (in this work, Sn) can be found in bimetallic catalysts in the form of multiple structures that range from completely segregated phases of each metal to perfectly mixed (Pt/Sn) alloys 8 . Optimal catalyst preparation is achieved when the C-C bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of actives sites responsible for the reaction of interest (e.g. dehydrogenation).</p>
        <p>While PtSn alloys significantly promote the selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation, it also reduces and/or modulates the active Pt sites, decreasing the catalytic activity 5 .</p>
        <p>The structure of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In or Sn) has been studied by in situ XRD and in situ XAS. High Sn content and high activation temperature favor the formation of alloyed structures that significantly promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions 8 . However, the resulting large alloyed PtM particles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest to design more active, selective and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts [9][10][11][12] .</p>
        <p>In this respect, taking advantage of the confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated and stabilized in the porous structures within the zeolite crystallites [13][14][15][16][17] .</p>
        <p>In this work, we investigate how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in these subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm), located regioselectively at the sinusoidal 10R channel of the pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieve optimal catalytic performance. To understand the interaction between the subnanometric Pt and Sn species, we have applied several characterization techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy and CO-IR spectroscopy.</p>
        <p>It will be shown, subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
        <p>Initially, a K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample (containing 0.4 wt% of Pt, 0.9 wt% of Sn and 0.6 wt% of K) was prepared by a one-pot synthesis according to our reported synthesis method and then calcined in air, giving rise to the formation of atomically dispersed Pt and Sn species in pure-silica MFI zeolite 17 .</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 1a-1d and Supplementary Figures 1 and2, the location of singly dispersed Pt atoms in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample was determined by combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) imaging and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging, which can simultaneously obtain the location information of heavy elements (Pt in this work) by HAADF-STEM, and the structure of the zeolite by iDPC imaging under low-dose conditions 18,19 . To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn or Pt) was measured and compared. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, and considering the image simulation results shown in our previous work, the bright dots appearing in the HRSTEM images can be ascribed to Pt atoms 17 .</p>
        <p>The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during the H2 reduction treatment were investigated by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time at 600 o C, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample are completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600 o C 14 , as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Figure 2a), and the appearance of Pt-Pt contributions in the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra (Figure 2b and Table 1). STEM images show that the majority of the metal reassembles as subnanometric clusters of 0.5-0.6 nm during the H2 treatment. The size of Pt clusters remains virtually unaltered regardless of the reduction time from 0 to 22 h, indicating high structural robustness (Supplementary Figures 456789). The average size of Pt species in K-PtSn@MFI after reduction at 600 o C for 0-22 h was also analyzed by EXAFS (see fitting details on the Pt-edge EXAFS results in Supplementary Figure S10). As shown in Table 1, the coordination number of Pt-Pt remains unchanged around 6-7 for all reduction times. We note that a small fraction of larger particles co-exist with the very small clusters in all these samples, leading to an average EXAFS coordination number slightly larger than that one would expect for Pt clusters of 0.5-0.6 nm. However, the vast majority of Pt ensembles observed by electron microscopy are below 0.6 nm and remain stable regardless of the reduction time at 600 o C. Analysis of the STEM-iDPC images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are at the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the time of H2 reduction treatment at 600 o C (Figure 1e-1t and Supplementary Figures 111213141516)</p>
        <p>The nature of Sn species and their coordination environment in the K-PtSn@MFI samples was also studied by Sn-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Sn is inferred to be Sn(IV) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-air sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Figure 2c). Analysis of the EXAFS region (Figure 2d, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 17) shows the virtual lack of heavy backscatters in this sample (e.g. absence of Sn-O-Sn ensembles, which are otherwise observed in the bulk SnO2 standard), which indicates that Sn is atomically dispersed inside the MFI. Additional 31 P MAS NMR data of adsorbed trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) on Pt-free K-Sn-MFI (prepared by the same procedure as the K-PtSn@MFI sample but without the addition of Pt precursor), show resonances at below 50 ppm (Supplementary Figure 18) that indicate that the vast majority of the Sn species is present as extra-framework species in the unreduced catalyst 20 .</p>
        <p>After treatment with H2 from room temperature to 600 o C, the Sn(IV) species reduces to Sn species with approximately three Sn-O bonds on average according to EXAFS (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(II) in a bulk SnO standard. We infer that labile oxygen in the unreduced K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample reacted with H2 to form Sn(II) species covalently bonded to oxygens from the support. The 31 P NMR spectrum of adsorbed TMPO confirms this observation, as new bands at 50-60 ppm grow in H2 that can be attributed to coordinately unsaturated SnO2-x, which adsorb TMPO and give 31 P NMR signal in the same region as framework-type Sn species (Supplementary Figure 18) 20 . Within the sensitivity of XANES, the chemical states of Sn remain unchanged when the reduction time at 600 o C is extended from 0 h to 22 h. Fitting of the EXAFS spectra also give almost the same Sn-O coordination number regardless of the reduction time (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 17). However, and interestingly, we observed drastic changes in the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation as a function of the reduction time (vide infra), which denote the occurrence of some structural changes when prolonging the exposure to H2. The fraction of Sn responsible for the tuning the Pt catalytic properties appears to be too small to manifest using an average technique like EXAFS, where Sn-O contributions clearly dominate (see</p>
        <p>In summary, neither the Pt LIII-edge nor the Sn K-edge EXAFS show evidence of any kind of bimetallic interactions in this series of samples, which show in contrast evident in literature reference samples when the two metals are well-alloyed [21][22][23] . Nevertheless, the presence of Sn in these catalysts has a strong effect on the catalytic properties of Pt, which will be discussed later in this work.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected by EXAFS 24 . (e-h) K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample, (i-l) K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-6h sample, (m-p) K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h sample, (q-t) K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample. a The fits were performed on the first coordination shell (ΔR = 2.0-3.0 Å) over FT of the k 1 k 2 k 3 -weighted χ(k) functions performed in the Δk = 3.6-16.7 Å -1 interval. The standard Pt foil was fitted individually while the samples were fitted using a co-refinement approach resulting into one NPt-Pt, R and σ 2 for each sample and one ΔE0 common for all samples. Non optimized parameters are recognizable by the absence of the corresponding error bar. S0 2 = 0.89 b The fits were performed on the first coordination shell (ΔR = 1.0-2.0 Å) over FT of the k 1 k 2 k 3 -weighted χ(k) functions performed in the Δk = 2.8-11.0 Å -1 interval. The standards SnO2 and SnO were fitted individually while the four samples were fitted using a co-refinement approach resulting into one NSn-O, RSn-O, σ 2 per sample and one ΔE0 for each series. Non optimized parameters are recognizable by the absence of the corresponding error bar. SnO2 S0 2 = 0.89; SnO S0 2 = 1.0.</p>
        <p>To avoid the oxidation of PtSn clusters in air, TEM experiments were carried out using a vacuum transfer TEM holder when transferring the reduced sample into the microscope (see details in Supplementary Figure 19) 25,26 . As shown in Supplementary Figures 20212223, well distributed subnanometric Pt clusters are observed in the quasi in situ TEM experiments and their location is determined to be in the 10R sinusoidal channels according to the STEM-iDPC images (Supplementary Figures 2425262728293031). Due to the very small size of the PtSn clusters and the relatively low stability of the zeolite support under the electron beam, it is extremely difficult to obtain the information on the distribution of Pt and Sn by conventional X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, though that technique can work quite well on bimetallic nanoparticles 27,28 . In order to quantitatively describe the spatial distribution of subnanometric Pt and Sn in the various K-PtSn@MFI samples, the HR HAADF-STEM images were analyzed by a modified K-means clustering method (an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for signal processing as explained in Supplementary Figures 32-S33) 17 . As can be seen in Figure 3, only Pt and Sn species that can be identified by the K-means clustering analysis based on the different Z-contrast of Pt and Sn species in the HR HAADF-STEM image can be considered. We must note that the analysis only detects small Sn clusters adjacent to small Pt clusters, because of the lack of sensitivity to locate single Sn atoms, as discussed in our previous work 17 . As shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 34-37, we have found that as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample also increases, reaching &gt;50% in both K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h. We note that this analysis is only semi-quantitative, taking into account that a) HAADF-STEM does not provide sufficient Z-contrast to detect isolated Sn atoms that may be contacting the Pt clusters, and b) part of the 3D information of the zeolite is lost in the 2D image processing. However, our K-means clustering analysis identifies a gradually greater contact between Pt and Sn when increasing the reduction time. Independent observations of the Pt performance in CO chemisorption and propane dehydrogenation experiments suggest that the number of Pt clusters that contain Sn is actually much greater than 50% at the longest reduction times (here-in-below).</p>
        <p>Considering the size of the metal clusters confined in the sinusoidal channels of MFI (Figure 1), the lack of Pt/Sn interactions detectable by EXAFS, and the clear presence of Sn-O and Pt-Pt bonds (Table 1), we speculate that a representative reduced bimetallic PtSn cluster in this sample is comprised of 8-10 atoms Pt core and a very few Sn atoms making direct contact with the support oxygens. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the Sn seems to exist as partially reduced SnO2-x clusters that do not directly interact with the Pt, rising strong Sn-O signals in the EXAFS spectra.</p>
        <p>For comparison, we have also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR HAADF-STEM images for samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after the H2 treatments, prior to introduction into the microscope (see Figure 3e-h). When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decays significantly (Figure 4). At very low reduction times (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h), the percentage of Pt clusters interacting with Sn is very low (~10 %), and increases to approximately ~20% as the reduction time is prolonged for the next 22 h (Supplementary Figures 383940414243). We infer that the two metals segregate as the oxophilic Sn is mobilized in contact with air, as widely observed with bimetallic nanoparticles in the literature [29][30][31] . As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, while the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material. Moreover, the complicated structure of K-PtSn@MFI also brings difficulty to distinguish the Pt and Sn species, which has already been explained in our previous work 17 . Despite the artifacts that may be introduced by the above factors, the percentages of contacted PtSn clusters in K-PtSn@MFI samples measured under quasi in situ conditions are clearly higher than the values obtained in the corresponding ex situ experiments, confirming the influence of the reduction treatment on the spatial relationship between Pt and Sn species, and stressing the necessity to protect the reduced sample from air in order to get reliable results.</p>
        <p>Subnanometric Pt clusters seem to have a higher probability to interact with subnanometric Sn species after long-time reduction treatment. Such geometric characteristic indicate that Pt clusters probably are firstly reduced by H2, consistent with previous work showing full Pt reduction at &lt;200 ⁰C 14 , and then followed by the reduction of Sn(IV) species and subsequent migration to meet the Pt clusters, also consistent with the time-resolved Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge XANES spectra of the pristine K-PtSn@MFI in H2 reported here (Supplementary Figures 4445).</p>
        <p>In order to detect possible Pt-Sn interaction in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples, we have employed IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule (CO-IR) to investigate the electronic properties of Pt species. As shown in Figure 5a, the bimetallic K-PtSn@MFI samples show a band at ~1887 cm -1 that the monometallic K-Pt@MFI does not. This band is slightly blue shifted relative to that observed in the K-Sn@MFI sample, which can be inferred to CO adsorbed onto Pt-SnOx sites.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the contribution of this band decreases when increasing the pre-reduction time, as a reduction of Sn(IV) species occurs. Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS show, in contrast, that Sn species exist as highly dispersed SnOx and the averaged chemical states of Sn species in the whole sample is close to Sn(II), regardless of the reduction time (Figure 2 and Table 1). We believe that the reduced Sn species in contact with Pt clusters represent a fraction of the total Sn species in the whole material, which is too small to be captured by an average technique such as EXAFS 24 .</p>
        <p>The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected on the changes of CO adsorption bands in the range of 1850 to 1650 cm -1 .</p>
        <p>For the CO bands in this range, they should be associated to CO adsorbed on metal clusters [32][33][34] . The position of the bands is related to the electronic structure of the metal clusters, which is controlled by the chemical compositions, size and geometric structure. Therefore, it is difficult to assign the adsorption band to a specific type of species. Nevertheless, we can still see some trends of changes in the spectra caused by the pre-treatment by H2. The μ 3 -adsorption band of CO on Pt clusters (1690 cm -1 ) can be observed in both K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h and this band decreases drastically after 3 h of reduction treatment. On the other hand, the band at 1659 cm -1 also increases when comparing the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h spectrum with the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-3h spectrum.</p>
        <p>These changes indicate the modulation of the electronic structures of the Pt clusters during the H2 treatment and may be related to the interaction between Pt and Sn species.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the formation of PtSn nanoparticles is also confirmed by the decrease of CO-IR bands at 2018 cm -1 in the K-PtSn@MFI samples when increasing the reduction time from 1 to 3 h.</p>
        <p>The contribution of this band, which corresponds to CO adsorbed on highly under-coordinated Pt sites of nanoparticles 35 , decreases notably when the K-PtSn@MFI sample was reduced for ≥3 h at 600 o C by H2, as more Sn adds to the cluster and inhibits CO to adsorb on the adjacent Pt atoms [36][37][38] .</p>
        <p>However, we do not observe Pt-Sn bonding by EXAFS, indicating that the fraction of PtSn nanoparticles in the whole sample is low, consistent with the fact that the vast majority of Pt retains the original Pt-Pt coordination (Table 1).</p>
        <p>The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples can be also inferred from the CO-chemisorption results. As displayed in Figure 5b, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with the reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h.</p>
        <p>Since the size of Pt remains almost unchanged according to the characterization results based on STEM and EXAFS, the decrease of exposed Pt surface should be caused by the formation of Pt-Sn interaction, in a scenario where partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surface of Pt clusters. Again, we note that the amount of Sn atoms interacting with the Pt clusters must be low, which causes the absence Pt-Sn contribution in EXAFS spectra and a Pt dispersion of ~30% in the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample 39,40 .</p>
        <p>According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS results, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn (IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters. The structural evolution of Pt and Sn species starting from the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-air sample is schematized in Figure 6, in which we postulate that the reduction of Pt single atoms to Pt clusters, the reduction of atomically dispersed Sn(IV) to reduced Sn species, and the formation of PtSn bimetallic clusters occur stepwise, with a final PtSn cluster structure consisting of a few Pt atoms (we infer less than 15 based on the microscopy results) and a very few Sn atoms (e.g. 2-3) coordinated to their external surface, probably through Pt-O-Sn bonding. We note that the geometric and electronic features of these PtSn bimetallic clusters are not common in most conventional PtSn bimetallic catalysts 41,42 . The error bars were determined by three independent catalytic tests under given conditions. The error for initial specific activity and deactivation constant in all the samples is within ±6 % and ±12 %, respectively.</p>
        <p>To show the implication of the structural changes during H2 reduction treatment, we have tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples for propane dehydrogenation. Along this study, we have used a short contact time to get conversions below the thermodynamic equilibrium (~70%), to better study the influence of pre-reduction treatment. The catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI after different pre-reduction treatments is shown in Figure 7. As can be seen in Figure 7a, after a short-time pre-reduction treatment (the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion is ~50% (the thermodynamic conversion for propane to propylene and H2 is ~70% at a theoretical 100 % propylene selectivity), and the selectivity to propylene is ~82%, giving ~18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics. A fast decay of the activity was observed after ~15 h of time on stream, caused by the blockage of the Pt sites by coke.</p>
        <p>When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600 o C for 1 h before the PDH reaction (activation condition used in our previous work 17 , see Figure 7b), then the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation decreased slightly while the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%. More importantly, the deactivation rate was also lower than the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample. If the pre-reduction time at 600 o C was further increased to 3 h, 6 h and 12 h (Figure 7c-7e), the initial conversion of propane almost remained almost unchanged while the deactivation of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was significantly suppressed. The coke preferentially forms on the unselective Pt sites, therefore, the K-PtSn@MFI sample with higher initial selectivity also exhibits slower deactivation 43 . The slower deactivation is associated to the reductive atmosphere since thermal treatment in N2 at 600 o C cannot alleviate the deactivation (Supplementary Figure 46). However, if the K-PtSn@MFI sample was pre-reduced with H2 for a longer time of 22 h (see Figure 7f), a slight decrease of the initial activity was observed, but high initial selectivity and very slow deactivation were achieved. Notice that in all the above catalytic tests, no H2 was introduced in the feed gas.</p>
        <p>Slower deactivation and longer lifetime could be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion 44,45 .</p>
        <p>As can be seen in Figure 7g-h, the initial activity on a per Pt basis is almost the same regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22 h, while the deactivation constant varies drastically. This result is remarkable, since the number of Pt sites and their reactivity must remain high while Sn is incorporated to (selectively) modulate the Pt reactivity to avoid hydrogenolysis and coke formation reactions. In this sense, microscopy and EXAFS confirm not only that the K-PtSn@MFI samples remain ultra-dispersed after the various thermal treatments, but that the incorporation of Sn at the longest reduction times is just enough to greatly inhibit the deactivation by coke without compromising the dehydrogenation catalytic activity.</p>
        <p>To further confirm the role of Sn, we have studied the influence of Sn loading in the K-PtSn@MFI sample on its catalytic performance (see Supplementary Figures 4748495051and Supplementary Discussion). The sample with lower Sn loading gives lower initial selectivity to propylene and faster deactivation, which can be associated to lower amount of PtSn contacts in that sample. While in the case of the sample with high Sn loading, PtSn alloy nanoparticles (&gt;2 nm) are formed due to the presence of plenty of defects in the MFI zeolite crystallites and the sintering of Pt species results in a decrease of activity. These results confirm the critical role of Sn on improving the selectivity to propylene and suppressing the catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, the results clearly show that the formation of bimetallic PtSn clusters is much more favorable when Pt and Sn are confined in the sinusoidal 10MR channels of MFI zeolite.</p>
        <p>The used K-PtSn@MFI sample after propane dehydrogenation reaction tests has also been characterized by STEM. As shown in Supplementary Figures 525354555657, no sintering of Pt clusters into larger particles has been observed in each of the samples after propane dehydrogenation reaction and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high stability (Supplementary Figures 58596061). As shown in Supplementary Figures 6263, the high initial activity and very slow deactivation as well as the size of subnanometric PtSn clusters has been preserved for three reaction cycles.</p>
        <p>The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI is also reflected in the initial reactivity for propane dehydrogenation in comparison literature results. We have summarized the catalyst activation conditions and catalytic performances of supported Pt catalysts in the recent literature (see Supplementary Table 1) and the initial activity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample on a per Pt basis is among the highest, at the same time that the deactivation rate is among the lowest. Compared to our previous work (catalyst activated by 1 h reduction at 600 o C in H2) 17 , the optimized activation conditions developed in the current work lead to a 7-fold decrease in deactivation constant.</p>
        <p>On the basis of the above results, it can be deduced that a long-time reduction treatment at 600 o C is necessary to form subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx atoms or clusters, which show high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation. In additional experiments, we have observed that a shorter pre-reduction treatment at higher temperature (700 °C) on K-PtSn@MFI-air sample (K-PtSn@MFI-700H2-1h) also results in subnanometric PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels (Supplementary Figure 64), showing similar high selectivity and very low deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Supplementary Figure 65).</p>
        <p>The amount of coke in the used K-PtSn@MFI samples after propane dehydrogenation reaction has been analyzed by TG-DSC. As shown in Supplementary Figures 666768697071, the amount of coke in all the samples remain below 1 wt% but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke has been found according to the TG-DSC results. The coke properties in the used catalysts have been studied by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Supplementary Figure 72, the ratio of D band and G band in all the samples ranges from 0.45 to 0.5, exhibiting minor differences (see Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, it can be concluded that the amount of coke and the physiochemical properties of the coke seem to be similar among the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2 samples after different time of pre-reduction. From a structural point of view, the PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even though the coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resultant carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites. The extended lifetime of the long-time reduced K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample could be associated to much less deposition of coke on PtSn clusters, leading to the low deactivation rate 46 . Since the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles 47 , the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient is sufficient to suppress most of the coke, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the whole catalyst lifetime.</p>
        <p>Finally, to show the potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst activated under optimized conditions, we have tested the catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI under a more industrially relevant conditions (e.g. no N2 dilution) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. As presented in Supplementary Figure 73, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of ~20% at 550 o C and a high initial selectivity to propylene (&gt;97%) under a high weight-hour space velocity of ~118 h -1 . After nearly 70 h of time on stream, the propane conversion decreases very slowly from ~20% to ~17%, demonstrating the outstanding performance of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst in this reaction.</p>
        <p>The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space can be different to the counterpart nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity. Combining multiple in situ characterization techniques (both averaged techniques like XAFS and site-specific techniques like IR and TEM) is critical to elucidate the nature of the active sites in supported catalysts containing isolated atoms and/or clusters 48 .</p>
        <p>images. By using a 4-segment detector, this technique allows imaging light elements, as it is the case of O, in the presence of heavier ones (Si, Z=14) under very low electron dose conditions, which is a key aspect in the atomic scale structural analysis of zeolites, which are very sensitive to electron beams. In particular, 2048×2048 image pairs were recorded simultaneously using a convergence angle of 18.6 mrad and a camera length of 91 mm. This configuration allowed us to optimize the collection of the signals on the HAADF and FEI DF4 detectors. In order to limit the damage by the electron beam, a fast image recording protocol was used by combining a beam current of 10-30 pA, a 1.25-2.5 μs dwell time and an automated fine-tuning alignment of A1 and C1 using the 
            <rs type="software">OptiSTEM</rs> software. To obtain images with good quality, the beam current and image acquisition time should be optimized according to the stability of the sample under the beam.

        <p>For the quasi in situ TEM studies on the K-PtSn@MFI samples, the powder of the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-air sample was reduced by H2 flow at 600 o C for a given time (from 1 h to 22 h) and then the reactor for reduction treatment was closed and transfer to glove box. The preparation of the grid for TEM measurement was carried out in the glove box to protect the sample from oxidation by air. After the sample preparation, the TEM grid is sealed in the vacuum transfer TEM holder and then transfer to the electron microscope for HRSTEM-iDPC measurements.</p>
        <p>To determine the spatial distribution of the metallic species within the zeolite framework, a specific methodology for the digital analysis of the experimental images has been developed and coded in a home-made 
            <rs type="software">Matlab</rs>
            <rs type="software">script</rs>. First, to improve the signal-to-noise, the HR HAADF STEM images were denoised by combining the Anscomb transform and Undecimated Wavelet Transforms (UWVT) 49 . Then, a user-independent, fully automated, segmentation of image contrasts by clustering techniques (K-means method) was applied to recognize and classify the metallic entities, which is a requirement to guarantee statistically meaningful and unbiased results.
        </p>
        <p>To support the K-means clustering analysis and interpreting the details of the experimental images HR HAADF-STEM image simulation was carried out using 
            <rs type="software">TEMSIM</rs> software 50 . The complex structural models used as input in these simulations were built using the 
            <rs type="software">Rhodius</rs> software developed at 
            <rs type="creator">UCA</rs> 51 . To approach as close as possible to the experimental imaging conditions, a mixture of Poisson and white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated images. Then, the same methodology used to analyze the experimental images was applied to the on-purpose noise-corrupted simulated images.

        <p>X-ray absorption experiments at the Pt (11564 eV) LIII and Sn (29200 eV) K-edges, were performed in ALBA synchrotron 52 . The beam was monochromatized using a Si (111) and (311) double crystals, respectively; harmonic rejection has been performed using Rh-coated silicon mirrors.</p>
        <p>The spectra were collected in transmission (Pt LIII-edge) and fluorescence (Sn K-edge) modes by means of the ionization chambers filled with appropriate gases (Pt LIII-edge: 95 % N2 + 5 % Kr for I0 and 17.1 % N2 + 82.9 % Kr for I1; Sn K-edge: 89.4 % N2 + 10.6 % Kr for I0 and 100 % Kr for I1) and a fluorescence solid-state detector. Samples in the form of self-supported pellets of optimized thickness have been located inside an in-house built multipurpose cell described by Guilera allowing in situ experiments 53 . Several scans were acquired at each measurement step to ensure spectral reproducibility and good signal-to-noise ratio. The data reduction and extraction of the χ(k) function has been performed using Athena code. EXAFS data analysis has been performed using the 
            <rs type="software">Arthemis</rs> software 54 . Phase and amplitudes have been calculated by FEFF6 code. The values of E0 (inflection point in the first derivative of XANES spectra) used for data alignment taken from literature were the following: 29200 eV for Sn metal, 29201 eV for SnO, 29204 eV for SnO2 and 11564 eV for Pt metal.

        <p>IR spectra of adsorbed CO on Pt-zeolite and Sn-zeolite samples were recorded at room temperature with a Nexus 8700 FTIR spectrometer using a DTGS detector and acquiring at 4 cm -1 resolution. The K-PtSn@MFI samples were reduced at 600 o C in an oven for different times and then transferred to an IR cell allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres and temperatures from 25 C to 500 C has been connected to a vacuum system with gas dosing facility. For IR studies the samples were pressed into self-supported wafers and pre-treated in H2 flow at 450 C for 2 h followed by vacuum treatment (10 -5 mbar). After activation the samples were cooled down to 25 C under dynamic vacuum conditions followed by CO dosing at increasing pressure (0.4-8.5 mbar). IR spectra were recorded after each dosage of CO.</p>
        <p>The dispersion of Pt in K-PtSn@MFI sample was estimated from CO adsorption using the double isotherm method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C equipment 55,56 . Prior to adsorption, the samples Catalytic studies of K-PtSn@MFI sample for propane dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
        <p>The reaction was performed with a fix-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure using N2/propane as feed gas at 600 o C. The products were analyzed by a GC which can detect cracking products (methane, ethene and ethane), propylene, C4, C5 and aromatics. Before reaction, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was reduced by H2 flow (35 mL/min) at 600 o C for a given time with a ramp rate of 10 o C/min from room temperature up to 600 o C. After the reduction pre-treatment, the atmosphere was changed to reaction feed gas (5 mL/min of propane and 16 mL/min of N2 as balanced gas). The analysis was carried out with an on-line GC with automated sample injector, allowing to achieve an error within ±3 % for each data point.</p>

        <p>Firstly, a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 g K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar without K, product code: 17456.22) and 6.24 g TPAOH (20 wt% from Sigma-Aldrich, containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code: 254533-100G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were hydrolyzed with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH) at room temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 rpm). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with the same weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μL of aqueous (0.38 mol/L), 50 mg of SnCl4•5H2O and 150 μL of ethylenediamine were added to the above solution and the mixture kept under stirring for 20 min.</p>
        <p>The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 o C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt, Sn and K in the final product were ~0.4 wt%, ~0.9 wt% and ~0.6 wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 o C. Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow at 560 o C for 8 h and then at 600 o C for 2 h.</p>
