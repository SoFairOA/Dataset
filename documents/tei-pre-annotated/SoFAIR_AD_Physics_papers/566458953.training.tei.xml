        <p>We present a 6-D map of the Orphan-Chenab (OC) stream by combining the data from 5 years of Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (𝑆 5 ) observations with Gaia EDR3 data. We reconstruct the proper motion, radial velocity, distance and on-sky track of stream stars with spline models and extract the stellar density along the stream. The stream has a total luminosity of 𝑀 𝑉 = -8.2 and an average metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.9, similar to classical MW satellites like Draco. The stream shows drastic changes in its physical width varying from 200 pc to 1 kpc, a constant line of sight velocity dispersion of 5 km s -1 , but an increase in the velocity dispersion along the stream near pericenter to ∼ 10 km s -1 . Despite the large apparent variation in the stellar number density along the stream, the flow rate of stars along the stream is remarkably constant. We model the 6-D stream track by a Lagrange-point stripping method with a flexible MW potential in the presence of a moving extended LMC potential. This allows us to constrain the mass profile of the MW within the distance range 15.6 &lt; r &lt; 55.5 kpc, with the best measured enclosed mass of (2.85 ± 0.1) × 10 11 M within 32.4 kpc. With the OC stream's closest approach distance to the LMC of ∼ 21 kpc, our stream measurements are highly sensitive to the LMC mass profile with the most precise measurement of the LMC's enclosed mass being at 32.8 kpc with 𝑀 = (7.02 ± 0.9) × 10 10 M . We confidently detect that the LMC DM halo extends to at least 53 kpc. The fitting of the OC stream allows us to constrain the past LMC trajectory and the degree of dynamical friction it experienced. We demonstrate that the stars on the OC stream show large energy and angular momentum spreads caused by the LMC perturbation and revealing the limitations of orbital invariants for substructure identification in the MW halo.We present a 6-D map of the Orphan-Chenab (OC) stream by combining the data from 5 years of Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (𝑆 5 ) observations with Gaia EDR3 data.

        <p>Stellar streams are one of the most impressive illustrations of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation predicted by the Λ𝐶𝐷 𝑀 paradigm (White &amp; Frenk 1991). While Milky Way-like galaxies are expected to have accreted a large number of stellar systems over their assembly history (Bullock &amp; Johnston 2005), only in the last 20 years or so have we started to obtain direct evidence of a large number of disrupting low mass systems in the Milky Way stellar halo (e.g. Ibata et al. 1994;Odenkirchen et al. 2003;Belokurov et al. 2006;Grillmair &amp; Dionatos 2006).Stellar streams are one of the most impressive illustrations of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation predicted by the Λ𝐶𝐷 𝑀 paradigm (White &amp; Frenk 1991).

        <p>Since the discovery of the first streams in the Milky Way halo, it was clear that streams can provide powerful constraints on the Galactic potential (Johnston et al. 1999;Binney 2008;Koposov et al. 2010) as streams approximately trace the orbit of their progenitor. While initial models of streams were often quite simplistic and relied on the (incorrect) assumption that streams are orbits (Sanders &amp; Binney 2013), new, more sophisticated ways of modelling stellar streams have since been developed (Bovy 2014;Gibbons et al. 2014;Fardal et al. 2015). With the number of known streams increasing over time due to increased depth and areal coverage of Galactic surveys (Koposov et al. 2014;Bernard et al. 2014), this has opened a window for methods that fit multiple stellar streams together with the aim of breaking degeneracies between the parameters of the Galactic potential (Bovy et al. 2016;Bonaca &amp; Hogg 2018). However, as yet more streams were discovered with the DES survey (Shipp et al. 2018) and Gaia (Malhan et al. 2018), the idealistic picture of streams being a clean and easy tracer that can be used to constrain the local Galactic potential has become more muddied.Since the discovery of the first streams in the Milky Way halo, it was clear that streams can provide powerful constraints on the Galactic potential (Johnston et al. 1999;Binney 2008;Koposov et al. 2010) as streams approximately trace the orbit of their progenitor.

        <p>As streams were mapped in greater detail using photometric data, it has become clear that streams do not look like clean Gaussian trails of stars. Instead they show stream gaps (Carlberg &amp; Grillmair 2013;Erkal et al. 2017), broadenings (Price-Whelan et al. 2016;Malhan et al. 2018), bifurcations (Belokurov et al. 2006), and "wiggles" (Li et al. 2021). The exact attribution of these structures to specific physical effects is still a matter of debate but is likely some combination of perturbations by other MW satellites (de Boer et al. 2020;Li et al. 2021;Dillamore et al. 2022), DM subhalos (Ibata et al. 2002;Johnston et al. 2002;Yoon et al. 2011;Carlberg 2020), giant molecular clouds (Amorisco et al. 2016), and interaction with the Milky Way bar (Hattori et al. 2016). Together this makes the analysis of streams and their use as a confident tracer of the MW potential more difficult.As streams were mapped in greater detail using photometric data, it has become clear that streams do not look like clean Gaussian trails of stars.

        <p>The final nail in the coffin of streams being straightforward tracers of the MW potential was the study of the so-called Orphan stream (Grillmair &amp; Dionatos 2006;Belokurov et al. 2007) with Gaia DR2 data. While initially the stream was traced over approximately 60 degrees on the sky, the RR Lyrae from Gaia DR2 allowed Koposov et al. (2019) (hereafter K19) to trace it for ∼ 200 degrees. It turned out that the stream extension to the South was actually previously detected and was called "Chenab" by Shipp et al. (2018). The reason for the mis-association of the stream as a new stream, as opposed to the continuation of Orphan, was that their orbital planes were seen as quite distinct. However, the cause for this was found to be that the stream is being actively perturbed by the Large Magellanic Cloud (Erkal et al. 2019, hereafter E19), causing the stream to twist and the stars in the stream to move sideways. While complicating the analysis of the Milky Way potential, this nevertheless allowed them to put strong constraints on the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), revising its mass to about a fifth or tenth of the Milky Way's. This in turn led to the realisation of a very strong perturbation to the Milky Way potential by the Clouds that manifests itself in multiple forms: direct gravitational pull by the Clouds and second-order effects such as the LMC DM wake (Garavito-Camargo et al. 2019;Belokurov et al. 2019;Conroy et al. 2021), the motion of the MW centre around the LMC+MW centre of mass (Gómez et al. 2015;Erkal et al. 2021;Petersen &amp; Peñarrubia 2021), and the deformation of the MW dark matter distribution (Lilleengen et al. 2022). Since then, the effects of the LMC, expressed as stars moving at an angle with respect to the stream itself, have been seen in other streams (Shipp et al. 2019).The final nail in the coffin of streams being straightforward tracers of the MW potential was the study of the so-called Orphan stream (Grillmair &amp; Dionatos 2006;Belokurov et al. 2007) with Gaia DR2 data.

        <p>The effects of the LMC have made stream modelling a much more difficult task, since it requires introducing a time-dependent LMC potential, and accounting for the motion of the MW centre. However, this modelling should now allow us to start probing not only the MW dark matter distribution, but also the LMC dark matter distribution, and how these deform throughout the interaction. Such sophisticated models require extensive, ideally fully 6-D datasets. Erkal et al. (2019) developed the first such model to fit the 5-D data of the OC stream from Koposov et al. (2019). Vasiliev et al. (2021) have also demonstrated this with a model that takes into account the complexity of the MW/LMC interaction applied to detailed data of the Sagittarius stream from Gaia to constrain both the MW and LMC parameters.The effects of the LMC have made stream modelling a much more difficult task, since it requires introducing a time-dependent LMC potential, and accounting for the motion of the MW centre.

        <p>In this paper, we focus on the Orphan-Chenab (or OC) stream as it is probably the best stream for probing the MW potential and the LMC. This stream is very long, probes the Galaxy from ∼ 15 kpc to ∼ 80 kpc, and is affected by the LMC. It also does not have the complexity of the Sgr stream with its unexplained bifurcation. Because of this, the OC stream was followed up by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (𝑆 5 ) over the last 5 years in order to make a detailed phase space map of the stream (Li et al. 2019). In this paper, we combine the results of the dedicated 𝑆 5 follow-up of the OC stream with other public spectroscopic datasets and recent Gaia data to model the 6-D phase space of the OC stream. We then use this 6-D track to infer the potential of the Milky Way and LMC through a detailed stream model fitted to the 6-D stream track.In this paper, we focus on the Orphan-Chenab (or OC) stream as it is probably the best stream for probing the MW potential and the LMC.

        <p>Most of the data presented in this paper are collected as part of the observations by 𝑆 5 , which couples the Two-degree Field (2dF) fiber positioner (Lewis et al. 2002) with the dual-arm AAOmega spectrograph (Sharp et al. 2006) on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) to pursue a complete census of known streams in the Southern Hemisphere. For more details about observation, instrument setup and target selection, we refer readers to Li et al. (2019). The OC stream is one of the 20 streams that have been mapped by 𝑆 5 . This paper includes 𝑆 5 observations between August 2018 and April 2021. A total of 41 fields dedicated to the OC stream were observed at the AAT, 34 of which were observed in 2018 and 2019, and are listed in Table 2 of (Li et al. 2019); the remaining 7 were added in 2020 and 2021. All of the fields have an exposure time between 3000 and 7200 seconds. Since the OC stream covers a large area on the sky and some other streams intersect it, we also include these stream fields in addition to the dedicated OC fields.Most of the data presented in this paper are collected as part of the observations by 𝑆 5 , which couples the Two-degree Field (2dF) fiber positioner (Lewis et al. 2002) with the dual-arm AAOmega spectrograph (Sharp et al. 2006) on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) to pursue a complete census of known streams in the Southern Hemisphere.

        <p>As described in Li et al. (2019), we select probable OC member stars by applying selections in proper motion space and in colourmagnitude diagram (CMD) space. In particular, we select the targets based on the proper motions and distances of the RR Lyrae stars in OC from K19. We compute the difference in proper motions between the targets and the average proper motion from RR Lyrae stars at a given stream longitude, or |ΔPM|. For the majority of fields we used |ΔPM| &lt; 2 mas yr -1 , while close to the Galactic plane (at |𝜙 1 | 15 deg) we used |ΔPM| &lt; 1 mas yr -1 . For most of the fields DES photometry was used for CMD selection; otherwise, Gaia photometry was used.As described in Li et al.

        <p>We first assemble the list of potential OC members from the 𝑆 5 , APOGEE, SDSS, and LAMOST surveys by selecting the stars within 10 degrees of the great circle established by K19. On top of the spatial selection, we apply a Gaia parallax selection, 𝜔 &lt; 3𝜎 𝜔 + 0.1 mas, which should remove nearby stars. We require that the spectroscopic metallicity is [Fe/H] &lt; -1.5 in every survey. For the 𝑆 5 stars we also require that the 84-th percentile of spectro-photometric distance is larger than 10 kpc (this guarantees that the star is confidently not a nearby star) to further reduce the contamination from nearby stars. Figure 1 shows the spatial and kinematic distribution of the sample as a function of the angle along the stream. On the plot we also show the linear spline-based regions (grey lines) that we use to make the preliminary selection of possible OC stream members. We call these fiducial splines, and they are broadly based on the stream tracks from K19. The splines are provided in the supplementary materials of the paper and the width of the selection region is 3 degrees for the spatial selection, 30 km s -1 for the radial velocity selection, and 0.5 mas yr -1 in proper motion.We first assemble the list of potential OC members from the 𝑆 5 , APOGEE, SDSS, and LAMOST surveys by selecting the stars within 10 degrees of the great circle established by K19.

The splines are provided in the supplementary materials of the paper and the width of the selection region is 3 degrees for the spatial selection, 30 km s -1 for the radial velocity selection, and 0.5 mas yr -1 in proper motion.</p>
        <p>For Figure 1, we use a convention similar to the one adopted in Figure 2 of K19, where for each panel of the plot we use the selection from all the other panels. In other words, the plot of radial velocity versus angle only shows stars selected based on positions and proper motions (but not radial velocity), while the plot of the 𝜇 𝜙,1 proper motion versus angle includes stars selected based on 𝑅𝑉 and position on the sky and 𝜇 𝜙,2 (but not 𝜇 𝜙,1 ). This type of plot allows us to cleanly see the completeness and contamination of our selections, as well as better assess how prominent the stream signal is. The coloured points on the plot show measurements from different surveys, with black points representing the 𝑆 5 data. The filled light grey regions in the top panel show areas targeted by the 𝑆 5 survey.For Figure 1, we use a convention similar to the one adopted in Figure 2 of K19, where for each panel of the plot we use the selection from all the other panels.

We remark that the 𝑆 5 data alone maps the stream over almost ∼ 110 degrees without any significant gaps, while for the Northern part of the stream (𝜙 1 80 deg), the 𝑆 5 data is complemented by SDSS, LAMOST, and somewhat by APOGEE.The OC stream track on Figure 1 is clearly visible throughout almost 200 degrees on the sky from 𝜙 1 ∼ -80 deg to 𝜙 1 ∼ 120 deg on all panels, matching the behaviour tracked by RR Lyrae in K19, but with significantly more stars, higher proper motion precision, and the measurement of radial velocities.

        <p>Here, we model the distance modulus distribution as a mixture model of the stream stars and contamination, where the stream stars are modelled as a truncated Gaussian (𝑁 * ) distributed around the stream track D (𝜙 1 ) and with the 𝜙 1 -dependent width S D (𝜙 1 ), both of which are represented by cubic splines. We model the data with distance moduli between D 𝑙 (𝜙 1 ), and D ℎ (𝜙 1 ) which is a 3 mag wide interval roughly centred on the distance track from K19. The background is modelled as a uniform distribution, and the mixing fraction between the background and the stream 𝑓 (𝜙 1 ) is modelled by a spline 2 . For this and all spline-based models described later we typically use different number of spline knots for different parameters. The model is implemented using the

        <p>We can use the sample of stars identified in Figure 1 to make a colour-magnitude diagram of likely spectroscopic stream members. We select all stars falling within the spline boundaries shown in the Figure, and use those to make a Gaia-based colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). We correct the BP, RP and G magnitudes by the distance modulus model derived in the previous section as well as for extinction. Figure 3 shows the resulting CMD with points representing stars selected to be within the position, proper motion, radial velocity bounds on Figure 1, and the colour of each point indicating the associated survey. Grey points show the stars that have positions and proper motions within the selection boundaries but are not within the radial velocity boundary of 30 km s -1 . The spectroscopic members clearly form a well-defined red giant branch and a horizontal branch with an RR Lyrae gap, with only a handful of stars lying far from these branches. The grey points on other hand are very diffusely distributed on the plot, indicating that our sample is very pure. Although we can see stream members on the giant and subgiant branches, the main sequence turn-off and the main sequence are not probed due to the typical distance to OC stream members of more than 20 kpc and spectroscopic magnitude limits.We can use the sample of stars identified in Figure 1 to make a colour-magnitude diagram of likely spectroscopic stream members.

        <p>In this section, we extract the radial velocity track of the OC stream. We use stars with spectroscopic data identified in Section 3.2. We apply the proper motion selection, colour-magnitude diagram selection and stream track on the sky selection. We then construct the model for the radial velocity variation along the stream. We model the radial velocities in the Galactic frame as a mixture between the stream, represented by a Gaussian with variable mean and velocity dispersion, and contamination (from the stellar halo) represented by a Gaussian. The likelihood function for the radial velocity conditional on 𝜙 1 is given below:In this section, we extract the radial velocity track of the OC stream.

When computing the likelihoods of individual stars, we account for their radial velocity uncertainties by adding them in quadrature to the intrinsic velocity dispersions. The priors on model parameters are mostly non-informative, where the prior for mixing fraction at spline knots is 𝑈 (0, 1), 𝑁 (0, 300) for the stream velocities, and 𝑁 (1.6, 1.6) for the natural logarithm of velocity dispersion.

        <p>The results of the modelling are shown in Figure 4. The figure is structured similarly to Figure 2. The top panel shows the radial velocities in the Galactic frame as a function of the angle along the stream for the modelled subset of stars. The middle panel shows the knots of the RV spline with their corresponding error-bars, as well as samples from the posterior for the V (𝜙 1 ) spline curve. The bottom panel shows the inferred radial velocity dispersion with error-bars. The measurements are provided in Table 6 andTable 7. We observe that the radial velocity very gradually changes along 200 degrees of the stream, reaching peak values at 𝜙 1 ≈ -60 deg and 90 deg. We trace the stream well down to low Galactic latitudes of |𝜙 1 | ∼ 10 deg (𝜙 1 = 0 deg corresponds to the point where the stream crosses the Galactic plane). Our measurements of the velocity dispersion in the stream show a typical dispersion of ∼ 5 km s -1 without a clear gradient along the stream. This is consistent with the measurement by K19 based on SDSS data alone (see their Figure 10).The results of the modelling are shown in Figure 4. The figure is structured similarly to Figure 2.

        <p>We now proceed to extract the stream proper motions by fitting them with a mixture model similar to the one used for radial velocities. We select stars by combining previous selections. We use stars from the spectroscopic sample defined in Section 3.2 that are within 30 km s -1 of the radial velocity track from Section 3.5, stars within the CMD mask defined in Section 3.4, and stars that are within 3 degrees of the fiducial stream track on the sky from Figure 1. We then model the distribution of proper motions in a narrow region around the fiducial proper motion track of the stream. The width of this region is 0.75 mas yr -1 at |𝜙 1 | &lt; 20 deg and 1.5 mas yr -1 elsewhere. The reason for modelling a narrow range of proper motions is that the observed 𝑆 5 OC stream candidates were selected by proper motion (sometimes in a narrow region around the expected proper motion; see Li et al. 2019 for details); thus to model the full range of the proper motion distribution we would need to take into account selection effects, which we avoid here.

The measurements of proper motions and proper motion dispersions are also given in Tables 8 and9. The extracted proper motion tracks are broadly similar to the ones presented in K19, albeit significantly more accurate. We also notice that a significant intrinsic (i.e. after taking into account observational errors) proper motion spread in 𝜇 𝜙,1 is measured. Near 𝜙 1 ∼ 25 deg, where the stream is at the closest distance to the Sun, the proper motion spread in 𝜙 1 is ∼ 0.15 mas yr -1 : which at 15 kpc corresponds to 10 km s -1 . That is higher than the dispersion in the radial velocity of 5 km s -1 (see Sec 3.5) and is also higher than the measured velocity dispersion in the 𝜙 2 direction of ∼ 0.05 -0.1 mas yr -1 . The difference in measured velocity dispersions along different directions is somewhat surprising but is in fact explained by the models; we return to this in Section 6.6.Here, 𝜇 𝑙 and 𝜇 𝑡 are the 𝜙 1 -dependent boundaries of the proper motion fits.

        <p>We see that the model reproduces the data extremely well. The stream is strongly curved on the sky, both in the North and the South near the stream edges. We also note significant stream width changes, with the stream being narrowest at the point of the closest approach to the Sun (and the Galactic Centre) at 𝜙 1 ∼ 10 -20 deg with a width of ∼ 0.5 deg. The stream is noticeably wider in the North at 𝜙 1 ∼ 100 deg, and South at 𝜙 1 ∼ -60 deg, with widths of 1 deg. We note that this implies quite a drastic difference in the width in physical units (200 pc vs 1 kpc; see Figure 7) since the edges of the stream are significantly further away at a distance of 60-80 kpc. This on-sky broadening is not expected in a spherical potential but could arise due to a flattened potential (Erkal et al. 2016a). Since the width of the stream is related to the progenitor's mass, it could also suggest that the progenitor of the OC stream was significantly more massive when material near the edges of the stream was stripped than when the material near 𝜙 1 ∼ 0 deg was stripped. We also note that the measurements of the stream where it crosses the plane are poorly constrained as the stream there is lost in the contamination. The spectroscopic sample is somewhat better suited to trace the stream in that region due to the availability of radial velocities.We see that the model reproduces the data extremely well.

        <p>While the model presented in this section gives a good description of stream density, we point out that K19 modelled the track and density using deeper DECaLS data, covering part of the Northern sky. That model showed a stream gap at 𝜙 1 = 76 deg. This gap is not clearly visible in our data and model because we rely on significantly shallower Gaia data and use 2 degree wide bins in 𝜙 1 which precludes us from seeing small-scale density features. As a final check of the proper motion/density model, we verify that the proper motion track extracted in this section is accurate and matches the one extracted from spectroscopic data by investigating the proper motion distribution of likely members from the Gaiaonly sample used in this Section. Figure 8 shows the data-driven proper motion distribution in the stream extracted from the Gaia sample. To make the figure we take stars within 1 degree of the bestfit stream track as stream stars, and stars that are between 2 and 4 degrees away from the track as background stars. We then subtract the appropriately scaled 𝜙 1 versus 𝜇 proper motion distribution of background stars from the distribution of likely stream stars. That should give a model-independent proper motion stream track. The stream is clearly visible on both panels as an overdensity. On Figure 8, we also overplot our best-fit proper motion tracks (shifted for clarity by 0.5 mas yr -1 ) from the model based on the spectroscopic sample and the Gaia fit presented in this Section. We see that the models agree well with each other, giving us confidence in our analysis. The fact that the models also clearly go over the background subtracted Gaia-only proper-motion tracks also gives us confidence that the 𝑆 5 spectroscopic target selection based on proper motions did not bias our measurements.While the model presented in this section gives a good description of stream density, we point out that K19 modelled the track and density using deeper DECaLS data, covering part of the Northern sky.

        <p>The first property we look at is the stellar density of the stream. While the map presented in Figure 6 shows that the stream seems 'brighter' at some locations than others, one has to be cautious of several effects that prevent direct interpretation of this. First, the colour-magnitude selection of stars used for the modelling is not the same across the stream: the edges of the stream are significantly further from the Sun and therefore we are only probing the tip of the red giant branch. Furthermore, there are also purely kinematic effects that should be taken into account, as the parts of the stream that are closer to us move significantly faster than the stars at the apocentre. This will lead to an apparent density decrease near the pericentre and a density increase near the apocentre (i.e. concertina/accordion effect). If we are interested in the physical stream density changes, for example associated with the current or previous location of the progenitor along the stream, we might want to correct for this kinematic stretching/squeezing. To do this correction, instead of looking at the density of stars per unit angle 𝑑 𝑁 𝑑 𝜙 1 along the stream, we need to look at the rate with which stream stars cross a fixed surface perpendicular to the stream, i.e. 𝑑 𝑁 𝑑 𝜙 1 𝑑 𝜙 1 𝑑𝑡 5 . This essentially describes the rate of flow of stars at each point along the stream. This is more reflective of the mass loss history of the progenitor than the stellar density since the 5 Here the derivative of 𝜙 1 needs to be the reflex corrected proper motion along 𝜙 1 .The first property we look at is the stellar density of the stream.

        <p>stream gets stretched (compressed) as it speeds up (slows down) along its orbit. In Figure 9, we show two measures of the density. The top panel shows the linear density of the stream corrected for the distance-dependent sample incompleteness and accordion effect, while the bottom panel shows the density corrected just for the distance-dependent incompleteness. The densities are shown in units of solar masses per unit time, by assuming a 12.5 Gyr old stellar population with [Fe/H] = -2, Chabrier IMF (Chabrier 2005) and MIST isochrone (Choi et al. 2016;Dotter 2016).stream gets stretched (compressed) as it speeds up (slows down) along its orbit.

        <p>We notice in the lower panel of Figure 9 that the densities without kinematic corrections change very significantly along the stream: they are significantly higher in the South compared to the North. In addition, the density rises by a factor of almost 10 in the North near 𝜙 1 ∼ 100 deg, which could have been interpreted as the location of the progenitor. However, all those features largely disappear in the top panel after correcting for the accordion effect and where the stream density appears much more uniform. There is some increase in stream brightness near 𝜙 1 = 100 deg, and possibly at 𝜙 1 = -60 deg, but overall the density is surprisingly uniform. This uniform density is also somewhat disconcerting as it does not help us constrain where the progenitor of the OC stream is or might have been.We notice in the lower panel of Figure 9 that the densities without kinematic corrections change very significantly along the stream: they are significantly higher in the South compared to the North.

        <p>The completeness-corrected linear density map shown in Figure 9 also allows us to estimate the total stellar mass by integrating along 𝜙 1 . This gives us ∼ 5.6 +0.6 -0.3 ×10 5 M as the mass of the visible part of the stream. This is equivalent to a luminosity of 𝑀 𝑉 ∼ -8.2 assuming [Fe/H] = -2 and age = 12.5 Gyr. This luminosity is somewhat lower (2 𝜎) than the luminosity estimate from K19 based on RR Lyrae count. The luminosity is however in good agreement with the mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.9 (see the next section) based on the mass metallicity relationship (Kirby et al. 2013), suggesting that we are not observing a small fraction of the actual stream, or missing a massive progenitor. The luminosity of the system together with its metallicity make the progenitor similar in properties to other satellites (classical dwarfs) of the Milky Way like Sextans and Draco.The completeness-corrected linear density map shown in Figure 9 also allows us to estimate the total stellar mass by integrating along 𝜙 1 .

        <p>Given the lack of evidence about the progenitor location based on the stream density, one may also try to find the location of the stream progenitor through metallicity gradients. It is a well-known fact that, for example, the Sagittarius stream shows strong metallicity gradients (Hyde et al. 2015;Hayes et al. 2020). In fact, it is expected that streams from dwarf galaxies should show metallicity gradients since most galaxies show negative metallicity gradients with radius (i.e. more metal-poor outskirts relative to their centre: Harbeck et al. 2001;Koleva et al. 2011;Okamoto et al. 2017;Mercado et al. 2021). Since the galaxy outskirts should be stripped first, we expect the metallicity in progenitor-less streams to show an inverted V shape as a function of angle along the stream. In other words, the metallicity in the stream at the location of the progenitor should be highest, and then decrease moving away from that point (see e.g. Figure 7 in Hayes et al. 2020). This motivates us to look for possible metallicity gradients in the OC stream. Here we rely on the catalogue selected based on proper motions, radial velocities and positions from the main 𝑆 5 catalogue. We use the best-fitting splines from previous sections and also apply additional quality cuts requiring that the best S/N for each star in both blue and red arms of the spectra must be &gt;7 (to ensure uniform quality of metallicities).Given the lack of evidence about the progenitor location based on the stream density, one may also try to find the location of the stream progenitor through metallicity gradients.

        <p>We plot metallicity versus 𝜙 1 for stars in our spectroscopic sample in Figure 10. The black points are very likely OC members, while grey points show the stars selected with the same selection criteria as the members sample, but with velocity deviating from the stream track of OC stream by more than 15 km s -1 and less than 25 km s -1 .

        <p>Since the first studies of the MW halo (Helmi et al. 1999), but especially since the arrival of Gaia data, it became useful to look at halo substructures in the space of orbital invariants -such as energy, angular momentum and actions (Myeong et al. 2018;Koppelman et al. 2018;Helmi 2020) -as substructures are expected to be more compact there compared to pure phase space. For example, Bonaca et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2022) looked at a large group of halostructures/streams in energy and angular momentum space in order to associate streams with different progenitors. Also, the lumpiness of the distribution of stars in the space of conserved quantities was proposed as a way of constraining the Milky Way potential (Peñarrubia et al. 2012;Sanderson et al. 2015;Reino et al. 2021).Since the first studies of the MW halo (Helmi et al. 1999), but especially since the arrival of Gaia data, it became useful to look at halo substructures in the space of orbital invariants -such as energy, angular momentum and actions (Myeong et al. 2018;Koppelman et al. 2018;Helmi 2020) -as substructures are expected to be more compact there compared to pure phase space.

        <p>The energy (𝐸) and the z-component of angular momentum (𝐿 𝑧 ) are generic orbital invariants as they are expected to be conserved in time-independent and axisymmetric potentials. In the case of the OC stream, since we do possess the full 6-D phase space measurements spanning continuously more than 120 kpc, we can directly test the conservation of these quantities across a large part of the Galaxy. Indeed, when Li et al. (2022) divided the OC stream into two components (𝜙 1 &gt; 0 deg and 𝜙 1 &lt; 0 deg) in 𝐸 -𝐿 𝑧 space, they found that these two components did not line up.

        <p>To compute 𝐸 and 𝐿 𝑧 as a function of 𝜙 1 , we take stream tracks of the stream in 6-D: 𝐷 (𝜙 1 ), 𝜙 2 (𝜙 1 ), 𝜇 𝜙,1 (𝜙 1 ), 𝜇 𝜙,2 (𝜙 1 ), 𝑉 (𝜙 1 ) together with their associated uncertainties measured in Section 3. We then sample from the uncertainties and evaluate 𝐸 and 𝐿 𝑧 of stream segments on a grid of 𝜙 1 . Here, we use the Milky Way potential from McMillan (2017). Figure 11 shows the resulting energy and 𝑧-component of angular momentum measurements at positions along the stream spaced by 10 degrees. The ellipse shapes show uncertainty/covariance in 𝐸 and 𝐿 𝑧 (corresponding to 1-𝜎 errors). The colour of the ellipse indicates the 𝜙 1 angle of the corresponding stream segment. We note that the uncertainties in 𝐸 and 𝐿 𝑧 are often strongly correlated. Before examining the figure, we also remark that the stream stars will not necessarily occupy a small region in energy-angular momentum space, as stars in tidal streams naturally produce a distinctly elongated (bow-tie shaped) E/L distribution (Yoon et al. 2011;Gibbons et al. 2014). However, in the case of the OC stream, we expect the intrinsic energy spread in the stream to be of the order of 𝑣 peri 𝜎 𝑣 ≈ 0.02 × 10 5 (km s -1 ) 2 (where 𝑣 peri is the velocity at the pericentre, ∼ 400 km s -1 , and 𝜎 𝑣 is the velocity dispersion of the dwarf, ∼ 5 km s -1 ). Figure 11 instead shows a very large variation in both 𝐸 and 𝐿 𝑧 . In particular, 𝐿 𝑧 changes almost by a factor of two across the stream. The energy variation from the middle of the stream toward the edges is 0.3 × 10 5 (km s -1 ) 2 . These large changes are clearly not expected from a normal disruption process, but must be related to the interaction of the stream with the Magellanic Clouds that causes a spreading of stream stars in energy and angular momentum space.

        <p>In K19 and E19, it was found that the stars in the OC stream are not actually moving along the stream track. This is caused by the gravitational pull of the Large Magellanic Cloud, an effect that has since been detected in several other streams (Shipp et al. 2021). Here, equipped with the full 6-D track, we can constrain this behaviour much more effectively. To do so, we use the proper motion and distance splines inferred in previous sections. Figure 12 shows the solar reflex corrected proper motion vectors along the OC stream together with the stream track. We notice that, as seen previously, the velocity vectors are aligned with the stream track for the Northern part of the stream (𝜙 1 &gt; 0 deg), while in the South the stream stars are moving out of the stream plane, pulled towards the LMC. This motion across the stream is also the reason for the bent-up shape seen in Figure 6, as the Southern part of the stream is moving up pulled by the LMC.In K19 and E19, it was found that the stars in the OC stream are not actually moving along the stream track.

        <p>In this section, we look at the inference of the Milky Way potential from the posterior samples presented in Section 5.3. In order to highlight our mass constraints, we first compute the enclosed mass profile of the Milky Way. This is done by taking individual posterior samples, computing the resulting enclosed mass profile, and then computing the 15.9, 50, and 84.1 percentiles of the enclosed mass profile at each radius. We note that due to the flattening of the mass distribution, we numerically integrate the density profile in order to compute the mass profile. The resulting enclosed mass profile of the Milky Way is shown in the top panel of Figure 15. Note that this enclosed mass includes the bulge, disc, and dark matter halo. For comparison, we show several other recent mass measurements. Our enclosed mass profile is a good match to the other measurements, especially those which fit stream data with dynamical stream models such as Küpper et al. (2015); Erkal et al. (2019);Vasiliev et al. (2021). We also highlight the Galactocentric distance range spanned by our stream data.In this section, we look at the inference of the Milky Way potential from the posterior samples presented in Section 5.3.

        <p>Next, we consider the fractional uncertainty of the enclosed dark matter mass in order to determine the region in which we best measure the stream data. This is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 15. Such a fractional uncertainty was originally proposed by Bonaca &amp; Hogg (2018). Using a suite of mock streams, they showed that given a suitably flexible potential, the fractional uncertainty in the acceleration (or equivalently the mass enclosed) should be minimized at the present-day location of the stream. For the first time, we are able to show the same result with real data. In particular, we best measure the Milky Way's dark matter mass at a radius of 32.4 kpc, with a mass of 𝑀 DM = (2.18 ± 0.1) × 10 11 M , corresponding to an uncertainty of 4.2%, and an enclosed mass of 𝑀 MW (𝑟 &lt; 32.4kpc) = (2.85 ± 0.1) × 10 11 M .

In particular, there is a large uncertainty on the mass within the closest approach distance, within which we are not sensitive. Similarly, at large distances, the enclosed mass is poorly measured because in this region the acceleration from the LMC is small -and smaller than the acceleration from the Milky Way. Between these two limits, we achieve the best measurement of the LMC's enclosed mass at 32.8 kpc of 𝑀 LMC (&lt; 32.8 kpc) = 7.02 +0.99 -0.86 × 10 10 M . Interestingly, Figure 17 also shows that our fits disfavour compact LMC mass profiles, i.e. where all of the mass sits within the closest approach distance. Instead, our models prefer an extended dark matter halo for the LMC where different parts of the stream experience different LMC masses. In order to better showcase this, we show the inferred density profile of the LMC in Figure 18. This shows that our models require an LMC whose dark matter halo extends out to at least ∼ 53 kpc at the 2𝜎 level. Such an extended dark matter halo is in agreement with the recently observed extent of the LMC hot corona (Krishnarao et al. 2022) and is consistent with the LMC being on its first approach to the Milky Way (e.g. Besla et al. 2007).Motivated by the results of Bonaca &amp; Hogg (2018), we show the fractional uncertainty of the enclosed LMC mass in the bottom panel of Figure 17.

        <p>In Sections 3 &amp; 4, we showed that with the combination of Gaia and the 𝑆 5 survey, we can measure the 6-D track and dispersions of the stream. We also showed in Section 4 that we reliably detect the dispersion of proper motions along the stream which appears to be around 10 km s -1 : higher than the dispersion of line-of-sight velocities of 5 km s -1 . In order to highlight the reliability of the dispersion measurements, as well as to further validate our stream models, we compare the observed and simulated dispersions in Figure 19. As a caveat, we note that the mass of the progenitor was selected to reproduce the average stream width on the sky. That said, the model is able to reproduce the trends seen in the data, such as the rise and fall of the dispersion in the proper motion along the stream, as well as all of the other dispersions. Interestingly, at large 𝜙 1 , the width of the distance modulus and the stream on the sky are both larger in the data than in the model. This may be due to a different mass loss history for the real stream (e.g. it was more massive in the past than in our model) or some additional complexity in the potential which could increase these dispersions (e.g. Erkal et al. 2016a).In Sections 3 &amp; 4, we showed that with the combination of Gaia and the 𝑆 5 survey, we can measure the 6-D track and dispersions of the stream.

        <p>In Section 5.4, we discussed the Milky Way potential measurement with a focus on the mass enclosed, which is robust across our choice of halo flattening. In this section, we explore why our fits prefer both a prolate and oblate halo over a spherical halo. First, in Figure 20, we focus on what features in the data the oblate and prolate haloes are able to represent. We highlight the on-sky track in this plot since this is the main improvement in the fit; i.e. the improvement in the likelihood between the spherical and flattened halo fits is mainly driven by an improved match to the on-sky track (as in E19). In particular, the oblate and prolate halo are able to replicate the downturn in the onsky track at 𝜙 1 &gt; 100 deg. In contrast, the spherical halo provides a much shallower downturn.In Section 5.4, we discussed the Milky Way potential measurement with a focus on the mass enclosed, which is robust across our choice of halo flattening.

        <p>Based on the downturn on the sky, we next investigate how the acceleration fields of the oblate and prolate halo differ. In order to study this, we consider the acceleration field from the Milky Way halo in the plane of the stream. We define the stream plane using the rotation matrix from K19, which defines the stream coordinates and hence the stream plane which goes through the Sun. One advantage of this coordinate system is that a force which points down in these coordinates (i.e. in the negative 𝑧 direction), will also point down on the sky in the OC coordinate system (i.e. in the negative 𝜙 2 direction).Based on the downturn on the sky, we next investigate how the acceleration fields of the oblate and prolate halo differ.

        <p>We shift this plane to go through the centre of the Galaxy. Given this stream plane, we evaluate the ratio of the out-of-plane acceleration to the radial acceleration for points on an evenly spaced Cartesian grid in this plane. We average this acceleration ratio across 100 random draws from the posterior chains and show the results in Figure 21. Interestingly, the oblate and prolate halo fits have a similar amplitude and orientation of the acceleration ratio in this plane. Furthermore, in the region where the stream is bending down on the sky (i.e. 𝜙 1 &gt; 100 deg), both haloes have an acceleration field that points down in the stream plane. Thus, despite their seemingly disparate shapes, both the oblate and prolate halo fits seem to be trying to reproduce the same acceleration field which can bend the stream down on the sky. Finally, we compare the orientation of the oblate and prolate haloes in Figure 22. In previous fits to the OC stream, E19 noted that the oblate halo orientation was consistent with the orientation of the LMC's orbital angular momentum vector, and similarly that the prolate halo orientation was consistent with the present-day vector to the LMC, suggesting a possible connection between the halo shapes and the LMC. We show the results of E19, as well as the LMC's angular momentum vector and present-day position vector for comparison in Figure 22. We see that while the prolate halo is still aligned with the LMC's present-day position, the oblate halo is now slightly misaligned with the LMC's angular momentum vector. For comparison, we also show the orientation of the short-axis of the halo inferred with the Sagittarius stream by Vasiliev et al. (2021). In that work, they considered a triaxial halo but the intermediate and long axes were nearly identical, consistent with an axisymmetric, oblate halo. With the improved accuracy on the potential in this work, we see that the Milky Way potential shapes inferred with the OC stream and the Sgr stream are now inconsistent. In light of this discrepancy, and also the broadly consistent acceleration field of the oblate and prolate haloes in the OC stream plane, we note that these fits may be trying to describe the deformations of the Milky Way and LMC haloes which are known to affect the OC stream (Lilleengen et al. 2022).We shift this plane to go through the centre of the Galaxy.

        <p>In Section 5, we focused on the combined influence of the Milky Way and the LMC on the OC stream. Next, we assess whether any of the other classical satellites also could have perturbed the OC stream. In order to do this, we take the same stream generation machinery as in Section 5.2 and add an additional perturber in the form of a Plummer sphere with a mass of 10 9 M and a scale radius of 1 kpc. For the present-day location of the dwarfs, we use the distances and radial velocities from McConnachie (2012). For proper motions, we use the results of Gaia Collaboration et al. ( 2018) for all the classical dwarf galaxies except Leo I, Leo II, and the SMC. For these three, we use proper motion measurements from Sohn et al. (2013), Piatek et al. (2016), andKallivayalil et al. (2013) respectively.In Section 5, we focused on the combined influence of the Milky Way and the LMC on the OC stream.

        <p>For the parameters of the Milky Way, LMC, and OC stream, we take the best-fit model from the oblate halo fit described in Section 5.3. For each of the classical dwarfs, we sample its present-day phase-space coordinates 10 times and rewind it self-consistently in the combined presence of the Milky Way, LMC, and OC stream progenitor. The system is then evolved forwards while stars are ejected from the OC progenitor to form the OC stream. We then compare the resulting OC stream with the one without a perturbation from the classical satellite (i.e. the fiducial stream). In order to evaluate the changes to the stream observables, we make mock observations of these streams at the locations of the knots and compute the difference in the observables with the fiducial stream. We then compare these differences with the observed uncertainty at each knot to determine how significant they are. We find that the only satellite which results in a &gt; 3𝜎 change in the observables is the SMC, which perturbs the observed distance by ∼ 3𝜎 in 2 out of the 10 realizations. As a result, we find that the OC stream is likely not strongly affected by the other classical satellites given the present-day data.For the parameters of the Milky Way, LMC, and OC stream, we take the best-fit model from the oblate halo fit described in Section 5.3.

        <p>Next, we search for associations between known MW satellites (ultrafaint dwarfs and GCs) with the OC stream. Previous works have searched for such associations by comparing the present-day phase space coordinates of each satellite with observables of the OC stream (e.g. K19).

        <p>For the ultra faint dwarfs, we use the sample of 46 ultra faints in Pace et al. (2022) that have full 6-D phase-space coordinates. In Figure 23, we show the closest approach distance and relative velocity at this closest approach for the dwarfs that have an approach within 10 kpc and 100 km s -1 . Interestingly, we see that Grus II stands out as having realizations that have close passages ( 0.1 kpc) with the OC stream particles at low relative velocities ( 50 km s -1 ). This raises the possibility that Grus II could have been bound to the progenitor of the OC stream. For reference, we show the escape velocity curves of a 10 8 M and 10 9 M subhalo which are modelled as Hernquist profiles, with a halo mass-scale radius relation taken from Erkal et al. (2016b). Interestingly, we find that 11% of the realizations would have been bound to a 10 9 M progenitor.For the ultra faint dwarfs, we use the sample of 46 ultra faints in Pace et al.

        <p>We note that during each rewinding, Grus II has multiple close approaches to the OC stream. The most recent of these occur ∼ 300 -400 Myr ago, with more ancient passages ∼ 1.75 -2.25 Gyr ago. Interestingly, in some of these earlier passages, Grus II passes very close to the progenitor we have used in this work. Thus, these rewindings are consistent with the picture where Grus II could have been bound to the original host of the OC stream ∼ 2 Gyr ago, which subsequently disrupted. Thus, Grus II would be the first ultra-faint dwarf galaxy associated with a classical dwarf galaxy.We note that during each rewinding, Grus II has multiple close approaches to the OC stream.

        <p>In particular, we see that the kink in the stream track at 𝜙 1 ∼ -80 deg corresponds to the point of closest approach with the LMC. We note that previous fits to the OC stream also predicted such a kink (Erkal et al. 2019;Shipp et al. 2021). For our best-fit model, this approach is very close with some of the particles passing within ∼ 6 kpc of the LMC. Furthermore, this passage occurs ∼ 370 Myr ago, when the LMC was at a distance of ∼ 107 kpc from the Milky Way. This suggests that the OC stream should be a sensitive probe of the LMC's past location.In particular, we see that the kink in the stream track at 𝜙 1 ∼ -80 deg corresponds to the point of closest approach with the LMC.

        <p>In Figure 25, we show how well the fits in this work constrain the past orbit of the LMC. In order to show the uncertainty in the LMC's past orbit without using our OC stream fit, we rewind the LMC in the Milky Way potential from McMillan (2017). In particular, we sample 100 Milky Way potentials from the posterior chains in that work. For each of these realizations of the Milky Way potential, we also sample the LMC's proper motion, radial velocity, and distance from their observed values (Kallivayalil et al. 2013;van der Marel et al. 2002;Pietrzyński et al. 2019, respectively). We model the LMC as a Hernquist profile (Hernquist 1990) and sample its mass from the value measured in E19, 𝑀 LMC = (1.38 ± 0.26) × 10 11 M , with a scale radius such that the circular velocity at 8.7 kpc matches the observed value of 91.7 km s -1 (van der Marel &amp; Kallivayalil 2014). We show the orbit for the past 500 Myr and show the location at a lookback time of 254 Myr, motivated by the median closest approach of the LMC and the OC stream in our models (see Fig. 24). We also show the uncertainty of the LMC's past orbit from the fits in this work by taking 100 samples from our posterior chains. Figure 25 shows that fits to the OC stream in this work give a smaller uncertainty in the past trajectory of the LMC. In addition, we see that the LMC's orbit in the potential from McMillan (2017) remains closer to the Milky Way. This is due to the larger mass of the Milky Way in the models of McMillan (2017, see Fig 15). In order to further explore how sensitive the OC stream is to the LMC's past trajectory, we perform two additional tests. First, we take the best-fit OC stream model (i.e. from Fig. 14) and turn off the dynamical friction the LMC experiences in the presence of the Milky Way. The resulting stream is a poor fit to the data with a difference in the likelihood of Δ log 𝐿 ∼ -3500. Without dynamical friction, the LMC's location during the closest approach (254 Myr ago) changes by ∼ 6 kpc, which is comparable to the LMC's closest approach distance to the observed regions of the OC stream (∼ 21.3 kpc). This shows that current observations are already sensitive to the dynamical friction that the LMC has experienced.In Figure 25, we show how well the fits in this work constrain the past orbit of the LMC.

        <p>As a second test, we re-fit the OC stream with an extra parameter that can scale up or down the dynamical friction the LMC experiences. In particular, we use the same setup as in Section 5.3 for the oblate Milky Way halo, with one extra parameter (𝜆 DF ). This parameter multiplies the dynamical friction term the LMC experiences and it has a log uniform prior between 10 -3 to 10. As expected from the first test, this parameter is strongly constrained by the existing data with a posterior of log 10 𝜆 DF = 0.31 +0.20 -0.48 consistent with 𝜆 𝐷𝐹 = 1. Finally, we note that further work is needed to determine whether this is a robust measurement of dynamical friction. In particular, in the model used for this paper, we have neglected the deformations of both the Milky Way and LMC dark matter haloes which have been predicted to affect the OC stream (Lilleengen et al. 2022). While these effects will need to be accounted for in future work, the tests presented here have demonstrated that the OC stream contains a wealth of information that we have yet to understand.As a second test, we re-fit the OC stream with an extra parameter that can scale up or down the dynamical friction the LMC experiences.

While these effects will need to be accounted for in future work, the tests presented here have demonstrated that the OC stream contains a wealth of information that we have yet to understand.</p>
        <p>In order to further understand the LMC's impact on the stream, as well as understand the peculiar "V" shape seen in the observed energy versus angular momentum (see Fig. 11), we now investigate the distribution of energy and angular momentum in the model.In order to further understand the LMC's impact on the stream, as well as understand the peculiar "V" shape seen in the observed energy versus angular momentum (see Fig. 11), we now investigate the distribution of energy and angular momentum in the model.</p>
        <p>In Figure 26, we show the observed and simulated streams in the energy versus angular momentum plane. Note that in order to aid this comparison, we use the same potential as we used in Section 4.3 (i.e., the best-fit model from McMillan 2017) and not the time-varying potential we have fit in this work. We see that the model reproduces the "V" shape. This is not very surprising given the overall good agreement in reproducing the phase-space track of the stream.In Figure 26, we show the observed and simulated streams in the energy versus angular momentum plane.

        <p>In order to understand how peculiar this distribution is, we first consider a stream disrupting in a static potential. For such a stream, we would expect the leading arm (𝜙 1 &gt; 0 deg) to have lower energies and lower absolute angular momentum, and the trailing arm (𝜙 1 &lt; 0 deg) to have higher energies and higher absolute angular momentum (see Gibbons et al. 2014). Thus, we would broadly expect the energy and angular momentum distribution to go from the upper left to the bottom right of Figure 26, with the smallest 𝜙 1 in the upper left and the largest 𝜙 1 in the bottom right, and 𝜙 1 smoothly varying in-between. Instead, the leading arm has more absolute angular momentum and the same energy as the trailing arm, and the trailing arm has the wrong correlation along the stream (i.e. 𝐸 increases as L 𝑧 increases). Furthermore, while the leading arm seemingly agrees with the static model from Gibbons et al. (2014), 𝜙 1 should be increasing as L 𝑧 increases: instead, it does the opposite.In order to understand how peculiar this distribution is, we first consider a stream disrupting in a static potential.

        <p>With our best-fit model, we can understand this remarkable transformation. From looking at different snapshots (see Appendix 7), we see that the before the LMC's infall, the stream was arranged as expected from the static disruption model in Gibbons et al. (2014). During the LMC's close passage, the trailing arm is essentially flipped over in 𝐸 -𝐿 𝑧 space, while the leading arm has a substantial increase in 𝐿 𝑧 and a decrease in energy. This substantial re-arrangement of the stream in 𝐸 -𝐿 𝑧 is similar to the expected effect of the Sagittarius dwarf on stellar streams (Dillamore et al. 2022).With our best-fit model, we can understand this remarkable transformation.

        <p>• We observe that while the apparent number density of stars along the stream increases rapidly toward the stream edges, when corrected for the accordion effect (slower speed at apocenter and faster speed at pericenter), the stream density (or stream flow of stars) is mostly constant along the stream.• We observe that while the apparent number density of stars along the stream increases rapidly toward the stream edges, when corrected for the accordion effect (slower speed at apocenter and faster speed at pericenter), the stream density (or stream flow of stars) is mostly constant along the stream.</p>

        <p>• The mean metallicity of the stream based on 𝑆 5 measurements is -1.9 with a spread of 0.3 dex.

        <p>• While the stream radial velocity dispersion is constant at around ∼ 5 km s -1 throughout the stream, we notice a significant change in the intrinsic spread in proper motions, detecting a ∼ 10 km s -1 dispersion in velocities along the stream near its pericenter.• While the stream radial velocity dispersion is constant at around ∼ 5 km s -1 throughout the stream, we notice a significant change in the intrinsic spread in proper motions, detecting a ∼ 10 km s -1 dispersion in velocities along the stream near its pericenter.</p>

        <p>In this paper, we have demonstrated the power of combining Gaia data with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up by 𝑆 5 of this very long stellar stream perturbed by the LMC. This has allowed us to put strong constraints on the LMC and MW potential. It also shows that we can directly constrain the past trajectory of the LMC and the amount of dynamical friction it experienced, and potentially probe alternative gravity models that predict a different past orbit of the LMC (e.g. MOND: Wu et al. 2008;Schee et al. 2013).In this paper, we have demonstrated the power of combining Gaia data with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up by 𝑆 5 of this very long stellar stream perturbed by the LMC.

        <p>The future of this analysis is manyfold. First, even the model presented in this paper does not fully reproduce all of the observable quantities perfectly, requiring a more complex model -such as a deforming and/or triaxial MW DM halo -which our data should be able to constrain. Indeed, Lilleengen et al. (2022) have already shown that the effect of the deforming Milky Way on the OC stream is significant. Second, while in this work we used an OC progenitor of fixed mass that was conveniently hidden in the part of the stream located behind the Galactic disc, the properties of the progenitor -such as its stellar and dark matter mass, and their extent -will likely have an effect on observables, and can be constrained with our high-quality data. With a detailed stream map and a stellar density measurement, we should also be able to constrain the details of the mass loss history of the progenitor.The future of this analysis is manyfold.

        <p>While the analysis presented here is potentially applicable to other streams in the MW (e.g. Mateu 2022), not many of them have detailed tracks (Patrick et al. 2022), especially in 6-D (Li et al. 2022). This may however change with the arrival of upcoming spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE (Dalton et al. 2012), DESI (Cooper et al. 2022) and 4MOST (de Jong et al. 2019). However, the majority of streams are not as long as the Sgr or OC stream: thus, limiting the amount of information we will be able to extract from each one.While the analysis presented here is potentially applicable to other streams in the MW (e.g. Mateu 2022), not many of them have detailed tracks (Patrick et al. 2022), especially in 6-D (Li et al. 2022).
